It finally happened (actually, it happened sooner than I thought it would): I was caught blowing my nose on the <a href="/blog/webcam.html">webcam</a>. Granted, the photo was only up there for 30 seconds, but it was the one thing I was trying hardest to avoid. Oh jeez, the thing I was trying next hardest to avoid—sticking my finger in my ear—just showed up. I guess it was inevitable... I can't be expected to watch the upload timer constantly.
