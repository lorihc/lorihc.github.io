<p> <b><a name="arinelles"></a>Ah, Arinelle's</b> </p>

<p>
Had the most awesome slice of New York-style pizza the other day when I was out running errands in San Francisco. It's such a bummer when you have an absolutely specific craving and you can't get what you want, and such an incredible rush of joy when you take the first bite of EXACTLY what you could taste in your mind. A slice of plain cheese pizza from Arinelle's on Valencia at 16th gave me that incredible rush.
</p>

<p>
The fact that Arinelle's offered the same soda-and-a-slice deal ($2.50) as my favorite place in NYC was a good sign, I thought when I walked in. I ordered the cheese slice and a root beer (the perfect pizza companion, IMHO). The guy behind the counter cut a large wedge from an irregularly-shaped whole pie and slid it into the oven for a quick warmup, and then transferred it to a sheet of wax paper so I could eat as I walked.

<p>
The crust was extremely thin and coated with a simple tomato sauce that seeped into the layer of cheese, the shreds of which clung together like a tightly-knit sweater. I personalized my slice with a dusting of garlic granules, a shake of red pepper flakes, and a sprinkling of salt, grabbed a napkin, and took a bite. I closed my eyes and was instantly transported back to Avenue A. I thanked the guy behind the counter for the perfection (which seemed to puzzle him), and headed out.
</p>

<p>
As I crossed Valencia on 16th Street, I took my third bite—and caught the eye of a man sitting next to the bus shelter. "Looks goooooood," he said. I grinned, swallowed the mouthful of pizza, and replied, "Mmmmm, it is." This caused the man walking in front of me to turn and smile as well. My perfect slice was spreading joy even to those who couldn't taste it.
</p>

<p>
I finally reached the rind of the crust as I approached Sanchez street. It was the least exciting part of the pie, but by then I was full anyway. I hope the next time I'm out walking around and get hungry, I'll be near Arinelle's. With that amazing combination of crust, sauce, and cheese drawing me in like a magnet, I have a feeling I will be.
