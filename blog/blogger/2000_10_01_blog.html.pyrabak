I've been having such a great time expressing myself with the <a href="../newthings/index.html">Year of Learning New Things</a> diaries lately that it's made me want to write about other things as well. Since the &quot;new things&quot; diaries are specifically about ice hockey, bass lessons, and other new discoveries, it didn't seem appropriate to muse about random stuff like commuting in the Bay Area or whether we're all becoming J. Crew clones in that area of my site. The internal pressure to spew ideas has become unbearable, however, so I've finally caved and created a blogger account. Let the traffic rants and Junior Mint-induced ramblings begin! 
</p>


<p>
And while we're on the subject of Junior Mints, I've been wondering: why do they bother having an "insert tab to close" flap on the small boxes? I mean, I can understand having one on the super size boxes; not everyone can eat the whole box at once (&lt;shame&gt;as I have been known to do&lt;/shame&gt;). But really, even the most restrained person can easily eat the 16-20 mints that come in the small boxes without needing to tuck the tab in. It is therefore my assertion that there is no "wrong" end to a small Junior Mints box, and the "open other end" warning can safely be ignored.
