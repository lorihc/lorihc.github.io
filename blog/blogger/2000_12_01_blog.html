<b>Ah, Arinelle's</b>
</p>

<p>
Had the most awesome slice of New York-style pizza the other day when I was out running errands in San Francisco. It's such a bummer when you have an absolutely specific craving and you can't get what you want, and such an incredible rush of joy when you take the first bite of EXACTLY what you could taste in your mind. A slice of plain cheese pizza from Arinelle's on Valencia at 16th gave me that incredible rush.
</p>

<p>
The fact that Arinelle's offered the same soda-and-a-slice deal ($2.50) as my favorite place in NYC was a good sign, I thought when I walked in. I ordered the cheese slice and a root beer (the perfect pizza companion, IMHO). The guy behind the counter cut a large wedge from an irregularly-shaped whole pie and slid it into the oven for a quick warmup, and then transferred it to a sheet of wax paper so I could eat as I walked.
</p>

<p>
The crust was extremely thin and coated with a simple tomato sauce that seeped into the layer of cheese, the shreds of which clung together like a tightly-knit sweater. I personalized my slice with a dusting of garlic granules, a shake of red pepper flakes, and a sprinkling of salt, grabbed a napkin, and took a bite. I closed my eyes and was instantly transported back to Avenue A. I thanked the guy behind the counter for the perfection (which seemed to puzzle him), and headed out.
</p>

<p>
As I crossed Valencia on 16th Street, I took my third bite—and caught the eye of a man sitting next to the bus shelter. "Looks goooooood," he said. I grinned, swallowed the mouthful of pizza, and replied, "Mmmmm, it is." This caused the man walking in front of me to turn and smile as well. My perfect slice was spreading joy even to those who couldn't taste it.
</p>

<p>
I finally reached the rind of the crust as I approached Sanchez street. It was the least exciting part of the pie, but by then I was full anyway. I hope the next time I'm out walking around and get hungry, I'll be near Arinelle's. With that amazing combination of crust, sauce, and cheese drawing me in like a magnet, I have a feeling I will be.

<b>Me: Homeowner</b>
</p>

<p>
It's just starting to hit me: I'm going to be a homeowner. I'm excited and scared at the same time. I have a million remodeling projects that I want to get started on right away, but with all my dough going toward down payment & closing costs, I'll probably have to wait. Heck, I may not even be able to furnish the living room *and* the bedrooms right away! It's kinda ironic: I'm doing this big "grown up" thing, and it's going to have me living like a college student again—scrounging furniture, dishes, pots & pans, etc. from friends and family.
</p>

<p>
The other interesting thing is that I've always kinda thought of myself as a nomad, someone who didn't want to be tied down to one place for too long... and yet I can picture myself keeping this house for 5 years, easy. Actually, buying this house isn't as much of a "settle down" move as one might think. I've often thought it would be cool to have homes in many different places, and to split my time between them. That way I could be a homeowner and a nomad at the same time. It might even make a nomadic existence more enjoyable, as I'd always be "going home," even when dashing off to London or New York (my top choices). This is one of the reasons I'm going to make an effort to keep my (rented) apartment in San Francisco. The house is 3 hours east of SF, in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Not exactly NYC, but a different atmosphere than SF, certainly—and the first step in my plan to live everywhere at once.
