<a name="pupils" id="pupils"></a><b>Pupils Equal and Responsive</b> 
</p>
<p>
A weird thing happened yesterday: I was standing in front of the bathroom mirror 
after showering, about to put some eye gel on under my eyes, when I noticed that 
my right eye was completely dialated, and my left eye wasn't. When I'd woken up 
about an hour earlier, my right eye felt a bit swollen, as if I'd gotten some 
cat dander in it, so I'd put some anti-allergy eye drops in. I'd never seen anything 
like this happen, though. I put some eye drops in the other eye to see if that 
made any difference. Nada. 
</p>
<p>
I tried opening and closing my eyes a few times to see if I could get the right 
pupil to react to light. Nothing. I tried covering one eye and then the other 
to make sure I could still see normally, and I could. Hmm. The fact that I could 
see had to be a positive, but the phrase &quot;pupils equal and responsive&quot;&#8212;a 
phrase everyone who's ever watched a medical drama on TV would recognize as a 
good sign&#8212;kept running through my head. If equal and responsive was a good 
thing, surely unequal and only one responsive had to be something bad. 
</p>
<p>
A short while later I developed a headache, though whether it was because of the 
additional light going through the dialated pupil, or because the dialated pupil 
was a symptom of a migraine, I have no idea. I seem to have a migraine hangover 
today, though, so I'm thinking that I was probably asleep when the blurry vision 
stage hit. Since that's the surest warning I have of an impending migraine, when 
I sleep through it, it's sometimes hard to figure out where the crushing headache, 
neck pain, and/or nausea came from. This'll be the first time I've ever noticed 
a single dialated pupil during a migraine, though. 
</p>
<p>
This morning my right eye still feels a little weird, and as I noted, I seem to 
have a migraine hangover, but otherwise my pupils are almost equal and responsive 
to light. I'm hoping it was a fluke.
