<p> <b><a name="sleepy"></a>Incredibly Sleepy</b> </p>

<p>
I don't have anything particularly interesting to say today—I just thought I'd let everyone in the world know that I'm tired. I was up for a little over 24 hours on Monday, thanks to an early flight back to SF from Baltimore and a late hockey game. I felt great when I went to bed, but six and a half hours of sleep were not enough, and I felt like crap the next morning.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday was better, thanks to an hourlong nap and another six hours at night, but what I really need is a good ten or eleven hours in a row. Playing two hockey games back to back last night and being shorthanded both times seems to have made matters worse, and today I'm tired to the bone. Keep zoning out at my desk.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the zoning out may have as much to do with a longing for my recently-ended <a href="/sabbatical" target="blogwin">sabbatical</a> as with sleep deprivation... I find I can code a few lines, and then I start staring out the window, or surfing the web, or tapping my fingers in time to the Radiohead song that's playing on my headphones. At this rate, I'm never going to finish my feature.
