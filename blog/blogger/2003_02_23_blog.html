Yesterday while catching up on <a href="http://www.loobylu.com/" target="a8win">Claire's journal</a> (I tend to read it every few months, several posts at a time), I noted an item about the relationship between liquid black eyeliner and getting old. Claire speculated that if she could even find her old liquid black eyeliner, it would be all dry and cakey by now. I just found mine while unpacking all the stuff I brought down from my house to Al's (argh, *ours*), and it is indeed all dry and cakey. Not that I would want to use it again, but throwing away that beautiful, slim, twisty black Bourghese tube is difficult. Maybe if I added a little water to it, I could justify keeping it? No, I should throw it away. I've just recently started outlining my eyes in black again (instead of my usual gray) to help define my face a little in the midst of the dark pink hair, but it's unlikely that I have the patience for liquid eyeliner anymore. And really, I'm going more for punk than for mod, and pencils are better suited to the job. See? I'm not aging. I'm just getting more practical.

I woke up this morning at around 10am, but I stayed in bed reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0804109990/avocado8/" target="a8win">Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</a> until almost noon. When I finally got up, my hair looked like that kid on Hey, Arnold!, only dark pink instead of blond. It's so bizarre that I kind of want to share it with the world: I suggested to Al that we go out to some open houses with me looking like Hey, Arnold!. He found this idea amusing, but I don't think he took me seriously. So instead we're in our own house listening to <a href="http://www.thislife.org/" target="a8win">This American Life</a> and slowly getting into gear for the day.
