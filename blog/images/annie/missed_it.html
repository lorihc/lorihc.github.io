I was hoping to get a shot of Turkey Leg here, but when Annie saw me with the camera, she put her leg down. Turkey Leg is the position Annie gets in when she's grooming one of her hind legs, and it's just what it sounds like&#8212;she extends the leg into the air so it looks like one of the drumsticks on a Thanksgiving turkey. This photo was taken in Mountain View, but there was a much funnier (and also unphotographed) example of Turkey Leg that happened here in Philly. When Al left for work one morning, he remarked that Annie and I looked like bookends: I was sleeping along my pregnancy body pillow, and Annie was in Prancing Pony position with her feet facing mine. I couldn't see her, but I took his word for it. Later, when I was getting dressed, I sat on the bed  to struggle into my support hose. Annie jumped up on the bed, plopped down inches from my right hip, and promptly started grooming. I stuck a leg in the air to get some leverage on the hose, and she went into Turkey Leg&#8212;and we were bookends again. Oh, how I wish Al had seen it. We looked completely ridiculous with our legs in the air at the same time.
