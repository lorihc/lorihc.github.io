 Of course I have a list of things I want to write about, but rather than waiting to write about them in order, I'm going to spew this one out right now: The audiobook version of Barack Obama's book The Promised Land is so good....

 I don't spend as much time as I used to browsing for myself at bookstores anymore&#8212;when we do go, I often look for something more substantial than Captain Underpants that the Beaner might like&#8212;but it is my habit to buy three or four books at a time when I do. Not sure why; I usually just find a bunch of things that look interesting and can't decide among them, so I get them all. The next thing that usually...

 To be honest, I've sort of been ignoring the budget impasse that's been plaguing our Pennsylvania state government. I've been through several of these before in other states (and I remember well a couple federal ones), and everything always turns out OK in the end. There's partisan bickering, a few services that don't affect me shut down temporarily, and every public television and radio station in the state starts freaking out. It's annoying, but the effects are usually limited,...

 After a brief interlude in contemporary non-fiction (I highly recommend The Post-American World &#8212;the audiobook is read by the author, who has both a compelling argument and a compelling voice), I've returned to the classics on my Audible wishlist. I've been listening to Dickens' Bleak House, and a passage from it that I heard today struck me as particularly apropos to our times....

 Thanks to Al's superior parenting skills (and longer attention span when it comes to playing Car Dealership), I got to spend a lot of time reading this holiday weekend, and I finished Friday Night Lights last night. On Saturday night I came across a section that discussed the conservatism of West Texas in general and the 1988 presidential election in particular, and I was struck by its relevance to the current campaign....

 I'm trying to (a) read more this year, and (b) pay attention to what I'm reading. I seem to be getting to a point in my life that I actually can't remember whether I've read something or not&#8212;a day I never thought would come. For years I've wondered why my mom penciled notes into the front of books in her bookcase that said, "Read 4/89" or "Read 7/03". NOW I KNOW....

</div>

 I started reading Dreaming in Code before Thanksgiving, and to be honest, I haven't finished it yet. I originally checked it out from the library, but a few chapters in I began to regret that I didn't have my own copy. I was dying to scribble in the margins. When the desire to scribble became unbearable, over Thanksgiving weekend, I finally hit on the idea of putting my scribblings on Post-It notes and pasting them to the pages. I...

 It seems like we've been on a book-buying binge for a year or more&#8212;and that doesn't even include the books we've been getting at the library. I *love* being surrounded by books, and we seem to be doing our best to bury the Beaner in them, too. One of my favorite things to do is share the books we love by giving copies as gifts to other children, but I can only spread the love so far. That's why...
