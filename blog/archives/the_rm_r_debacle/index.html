 Instead of just linking to the rm -r post, there's now something at http://www.avocado8.com/. (In other words, the face is back!) Once I get the book reviews (and possibly the movie reviews) back up, those will also be linked from the home page....

 To those of you who started visiting avocado8 during the pregnancy (or the election; they were going on at the same time)&#8212;and also to those who've been reading this blog for years&#8212;I want to apologize. Not for all the broken links, but for blogging about all the broken links. Just because they're tormenting me doesn't mean they should be tormenting you....

</div>
<div class="blogbody">
 Austen slept for 7 hours straight on Saturday night (and I didn't soak the sheets with breastmilk!). It was lovely, for a couple reasons: (1) I also got to sleep for 7 hours straight, and (2) I didn't end up lying awake in bed at 4:30 in the morning thinking about missing files. This morning Austen woke after only 4 hours, and after an only partially-successful attempt at feeding him in the side-lying position, I found myself awake&#8212;with pasty...

</div>
<div class="blogbody">
 For the past few nights I've had a hard time getting back to sleep after the 4am, 5am, or 6am feeding (the time varies depending on how long Austen decides to sleep). What keeps me awake is usually remembering one more thing that's gone forever. Like the slideshow of Annie photos. The photos of our trip to Mechanicsburg. The New Zealand photo journal. Basically, photos everywhere are gone. Because I didn't have a lot of space on my hard...

 I can't quite believe it, but I found ALL the images that go in the about town (san francisco) blog on various backup CDs. I hope I'm as lucky with about town II (philadelphia). In thinking about how I want to rebuild things, I've reconsidered moving The Ice Hockey Escapades back to avocado8.com. Although it started on this site, the entries I'm adding now are really about Al's hockey experiences as much as mine. So it seems fitting that...

</div>
<div class="blogbody">
 I'm too tired to explain the entire chain of events, but the gist is that the shared box that hosted avocado8.com and lori-and-al.com was shut down, and someone with root access deleted all the files. There were no backups. Over the next few days and weeks I'll be trying to piece together my sites from what I exported from Movable Type earlier this month, files that are on my hard drive, CDs, and web archive sites. For a little...
