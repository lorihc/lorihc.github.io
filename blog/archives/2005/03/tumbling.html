<h3 class="title">Tumbling</h3>

<p>
The thing I've been fearing would happen just happened: I fell down the stairs while wearing the Baby Bjorn. (Actually, my worst fear was falling down the stairs while carrying Austen in my arms, but this was almost as scary.) Luckily I only fell down the last two, and I seem to have instinctively twisted onto my side to protect Austen, who was unhurt. He seemed startled and puzzled, but he didn't cry, even when it took me a few minutes to get back up.
</p>

<p>
I banged my left knee and my right elbow pretty hard, and I seem to have twisted my back and my right ankle, but I'm still mobile (and still wearing the Bjorn), so the injuries must be very minor. Next time I will make sure that I really am completely down the stairs before I start reading the Wall Street Journal.

<p>I was living with my parents as was my sister when she took a tumble down the stairs with my infant niece in her arms.</p>

<p>I'll never forget the kindness my mother showed. She was a registered nurse and quickly examined Jennifer, my niece, and went on to explain to my totally mortified sister that each of us had been dropped more times than she could count and we had turned out just fine.</p>

<p>Congrats on your finely tuned maternal skills.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that... Before our son Luca was born, I used to be afraid to hit his head on the door frame when turning around with him in my arms. Actually, I was generally afraid of doing anything with a baby in my arms, even holding a baby in my arms.</p>

<p>Funny thing is... everything came naturally when I had to do it.</p>
