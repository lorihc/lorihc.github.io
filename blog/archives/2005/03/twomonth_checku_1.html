<h3 class="title">Two-Month Checkup (@ Three Months)</h3>

Austen went to the doctor for his latest well-baby visit&#8212;the first one involving shots&#8212;this morning. The over/under for his weight was 15 1/2 pounds (it was going to be 16, but both Al and I voted under, so we backed it up to a point where one of us was under, and one of us was over). Technically Al won again, though we were both so far off that I'd say there was no winner this time. I guessed 15 lbs. 4 oz., and I think Al guessed 15 lbs. 13 oz. Austen, at three months old, weighed in at 16 lbs. 15 oz. Yes, people, that's 1 oz. shy of <b>17 pounds</b>.
The nurse was a bit surprised, especially since her 6 month-old daughter had just weighed in at 16 lbs. 13 oz. the day before. 
</p>
<p>
This massive weight gain has put Austen off the growth charts for weight. He measured two feet exactly this time, so he's only in the 75th percentile for height, but even that was a big jump from last time. It might be time to move to the size 3 diapers... and to wash the 6-9 mo. clothes the nice people at <a href="http://www.perfectorder.com/" target="a8_win">Perfect Order</a> got us. (I'm also starting to wonder whether Austen was so small&#8212;and breech&#8212;at birth because my uterus just isn't very big. Maybe he had to wait until he was on the outside to catch up with all the other huge babies that run in my family.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Austen actually tolerated the shots (three of them) pretty well. He cried, of course, but as soon as each needle was removed, he'd back down on the volume. By the third shot he was a little annoyed&#8212;and probably wondering how many more sticks were coming&#8212;but he only let out a couple residual roars after I picked him up. A few minutes later he was  cooing happily and eating his hands. Honestly, I think the dose of Tylenol bothered him more than the shots did (cherry-flavored medicine has nothing on breast milk, it seems). Perhaps those hamhock thighs provided some cushion against the sting of the injections. 
</p>
<p>
The doctor had asked me at Austen's one-month vist whether he startled at loud noises (he did), but in the past couple days I've noticed that he's much more sensitive to them now. When we went to our first <a href="http://www.enjoytheshow.com/reelmoms/" target="a8_win">Reel Moms</a> movie in Cherry Hill on Tuesday (it was Sideways, which I really liked when I saw it with Al last month), they apparently forgot to turn down the sound to the promised baby-friendly level, and at the first cymbal crash (during the &quot;visit the concession stand!&quot; promo), he jumped a mile and started SCREAMING in terror. Similarly, it used to be that I could holler Austen's name in frustration when he wouldn't sleep at night, but when I did it last night I got a repeat of the popcorn promo reaction. :( Today he startled a couple times (but didn't cry) when I raised my voice while recounting a story over the phone to my sister. I wonder if I've made him nervous that he'll get shouted at again...
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I was reminded of my friend Shannon this morning when I considered the fact that after three weeks of going to bed between 9:00 and 10:30 every night and then sleeping 5-7 hours straight, Austen suddenly wants to stay up past midnight again. Shannon had been feeling some pressure to get her baby on a schedule, but her pediatrician said that it's really not worth the trouble. For the first few months babies are developing so rapidly that by the time you get them on a schedule, they change&#8212;and you have to start all over again. Although Al and I never really tried to get Austen on a schedule, I guess we thought that the previous sleep pattern was pretty predictable&#8212;and that it would only improve over time. In reality, it's more like a three steps forward, two steps back kind of thing. (And really, I shouldn't complain too much: Although it took five tries between 8:15 and 12:40 to get Austen to sleep last night, he didn't wake up in the middle of the night. I had to get him up at 7:20 this morning because if we didn't get a feeding in before heading to the doctor's, my boobs were going to explode.) I'm very interested to see what happens tonight, especially since the shots could throw him off his game completely.

<p>Man, if my 5 1/2 week old daughter slept that much, I wouldn't know what to do with myself.  As it is now, Lucy is generally awake from 4 pm until after her midnightish feeding (with only a couple of catnaps in between).  Lately, she's been sleeping through until 4 or 5 am, so progress in being made.  You are absolutely right though, once we start to get some semblance of a schedule, she enters a new phase and we are back to trying to figure it out again.</p>

<p>Lucy gets startled by noises sometimes, but especially by her burps when she falls asleep during her feeding.  That's high comedy, right there.  :)</p>

<p>But 17 pounds, wow.  Are you breastfeeding?  ;)</p>

<p>I'm glad you made it to the mama/baby movie!  Sorry about the volume, though.  You'd think they've never hosted one of those screenings before - it's always something.  Every week.  The sound, the lights, something.  And yet, we persist...</p>

<p>That's what Sarah, the woman I sat next to, said. :) Incidentally, she said that we were in the "small" theater, and that usually Reel Moms is in one of the larger theaters because everyone complained about there not being enough room for both grownups and carseats. I was pretty shocked at the number of people in the theater, considering how icky the weather was, and I could see how that room wouldn't have accommodated a crowd that was any larger.</p>

<p>17lbs!!!  That's amazing. Ellen seems like a pretty big girl & I'm not even sure she'll hit 17 lbs at her 6 month checkup this Friday.  You have a big healthy boy on your hands ;-)  </p>
