<h3 class="title">Sunshine Day</h3>

<p>
 When I was a kid growing up in Massachusetts, we'd always look forward to the day when you could finally go outside without your coat after a long winter. Usually that day would be in the 50s, a temperature that would cause you to don your coat in fall but that in spring felt wonderfully warm. Today was that day here in Philadelphia. 
</p>
<p>
I managed to get outside for no less than *three* walks today, which probably accounts for my good mood despite a relatively sleepless night. (The sleeplessness was my fault, not the boopster's&#8212;he slept for about six hours straight.) Austen was also in a fabulous mood today, whining only rarely and crying only once, if I remember correctly. [Aside: It always bugs me when people ask if Austen is a &quot;good baby&quot;, as if there's such a thing as a &quot;bad baby&quot;, but I suppose the people who ask are imagining a string of days like today when they think &quot;good&quot;.] Austen seems so far removed from the squawking little alien we brought home from the hospital 11 weeks ago. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/alert_in_stroller0215.jpg" alt="Austen, alert in his stroller" width="240" height="257" class="inline-right" galleryimg="no">It's not just a size thing, although he is, admittedly, huge. It's that he's alert and hyperinteractive and vocal and happy. There's more to him now than just sleeping, eating, and crying. He now has smiling and singing and flailing to his very own iTunes playlist in his repertoire. He spent an amazing amount of time awake in the stroller today, which made the walks even more enjoyable. And to top it off, we explored a new neighborhood and took some photos for <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town_II/">about town II</a> (I'll post them over the next few days). Yay, it's a sunshine day!

<p>Well, see, now I don't feel so badly for forgetting to badger you about the mama/baby movie.  It was too nice a day for a movie!</p>

<p>I was a bad baby. Sold the furniture to a traveling band of gypsies the moment my parents took their eyes off me.</p>

<p>Just look at those cheeks, and that little mouth! He does look like he's done some growin' over the past few weeks! I could just eat him up...</p>

<p>See what I mean? Everybody wants to eat him! :D Ratphooey was right -- it was definitely too nice outside to be at the movies on Tuesday. </p>

<p>I always responded to that question "well, he's not an easy baby, but of course he's a good baby, because there's no such thing as a bad baby."</p>
