<h3 class="title">My Entire Web Existence Was <span style="text-transform:lowercase">rm -r'ed</span> Last Night</h3>

<p>
I'm too tired to explain the entire chain of events, but the gist is that the shared box that hosted avocado8.com and lori-and-al.com was shut down, and someone with root access deleted all the files. There were no backups.
</p>

<p>
Over the next few days and weeks I'll be trying to piece together my sites from what I exported from Movable Type earlier this month, files that are on my hard drive, CDs, and web archive sites. For a little while, EVERYTHING will be broken&#8212;and sadly, some things will stay that way.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to think of this as an opportunity; since every link on both of my sites is currently broken, I might as well re-construct what I can more logically and not worry so much about existing bookmarks. This blog, for example, now uses MT's new-style archive links, so if you have links or bookmarks to individual posts, you should update them. The Ice Hockey Escapades will move back to avocado8 (where it started), and all the entries that are currently in static HTML files&#8212;entries I wrote in Dreamweaver before I knew about blogging tools (before some even existed)&#8212;will be moved into a Movable Type database. 
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure if about town (san francisco) can be re-constructed. Ditto the book and movie reviews. Many images from The Ice Hockey Escapades are gone forever.
</p>

<p>
I'm relieved to report that I was able to salvage all the avocado8 blog posts between January 9 and January 26 from Google's cache, though I lost some of the comments (I'm especially sad that I lost three of the four comments on the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/01/leaky.html">Leaky</a> post). 
</p>

<p>
In any case, if you're just here for the blog, you're all set. If you're looking for something else on the site, you're out of luck for the moment. (You may have noticed that the entire "Also By Me" section in the sidebar is gone. It'll be returning&#8212;hopefully&#8212;a little at a time) Please bear with me while I switch to a new hosting provider and try to rebuild what was a large part of my identity while also keeping my real life going. My sites aren't the only things that are devastated.
</p>

<h3 class="title">About Town Lives</h3>

<p>
I can't quite believe it, but I found ALL the images that go in the <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town/">about town</a> (san francisco) blog on various backup CDs. I hope I'm as lucky with about town II (philadelphia).
</p>

<p>
In thinking about how I want to rebuild things, I've reconsidered moving The Ice Hockey Escapades back to avocado8.com. Although it started on this site, the entries I'm adding now are really about Al's hockey experiences as much as mine. So it seems fitting that it should stay on lori-and-al. It's going to take a long time to get all the older entries into Movable Type (there are 70 static pages, many with two entries on them), and as I mentioned, many of the images have been lost. I'm grateful that I was able to recover&#8212;through backup CDs and <a href="http://web.archive.org/" target="a8_win">archive.org</a>&#8212;all the text, at least. I know that blog has helped several women (and men!) get started on the ice or at least feel better about their beginner experiences, and it helps *me* keep perspective about my own hockey skills.
</p>

<p>
By the way, thanks to everyone who commented and e-mailed and AIMed me about archive.org. Since my e-mail access went down with the site, Jay (who AIMed) was first. :) It's a very useful site in general (and especially for getting the old hockey entries, which date from 2000 to 2003), but I found Google much more helpful for reconstructing the entries for this blog. I'd never noticed the "Cached" link for each result before; thanks to Al for pointing it out.
</p>

<p>
I still have a long way to go here, but I'm feeling more hopeful tonight than I was last night (and on Sunday night, when I was freakin' despondent). I still do have a long parenthood post I've been working on (locally, thank god) that I need to finish, and more parenthood and philadelphia observations have occurred to me in the past two days as well. It just didn't seem right to post them when I have so much reconstruction work ahead of me. Anyway, please continue to bear with me&#8212;I hope to be (and to have the sites) back to normal soon.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Nightmares and Backups</h3>

<p>
For the past few nights I've had a hard time getting back to sleep after the 4am, 5am, or 6am feeding (the time varies depending on how long Austen decides to sleep). What keeps me awake is usually remembering one more thing that's gone forever. Like the slideshow of Annie photos. The photos of our trip to Mechanicsburg. The New Zealand photo journal. Basically, photos everywhere are gone.
</p>

<p>
Because I didn't have a lot of space on my hard drive, I tended to use my web server as my backup drive. Stupid, stupid, stupid, I know&#8212;why I never zipped up the whole Annie slideshow (or the photos from the kitchen remodel, or the photos from Korea, or countless other cropped, filtered, and captioned images that took hours to create) and saved it off to a CD, I don't know. I'm just an idiot, I guess.
</p>

<p>
Even when I'm sleeping I find myself dreaming of directories and backup CDs and missing files. I navigate through folder hierarchies, flailing about for bits of memories and moments lost.
</p>

<p>
Sure, I at least had the sense to save the huge original image files off to CD, but I'm not sure, even if I had enough time to crop and filter all those images again, that I could write captions with the same level of detail or passion. When I wrote about Annie, I was still crying daily (often hourly) over her. When I wrote about Mechanicsburg, we'd just gotten back, and the memories of what we'd done and how we felt about it were fresh in my mind. At least the kitchen remodel was chronicled in the lori-and-al blog, so I just have to re-construct the thumbnail and full images. About 100 of them. &lt;sigh&gt;
</p>

<p>
Can you tell that I'm having a moment of despair?
</p>

<h3 class="title">More On Sleeping Through the Night</h3>

<p>
Austen slept for 7 hours straight on Saturday night (and I didn't soak the sheets with breastmilk!). It was lovely, for a couple reasons: (1) I also got to sleep for 7 hours straight, and (2) I didn't end up lying awake in bed at 4:30 in the morning thinking about missing files.
</p>

<p>
This morning Austen woke after only 4 hours, and after an only partially-successful attempt at feeding him in the side-lying position, I found myself awake&#8212;with pasty mouth, burning eyes, and swirling thoughts. I finally managed to finish the feeding at 4:45, but despite a desperate desire to get back to sleep, I couldn't help mourning lost belly photos.
</p>

<p>
And then I thought, "I *know* I burned a CD off my Windows machine before the baby was born." So I got up, went downstairs, and prepared to pry open the CD burner in search of it. No need: When I removed the stack of papers waiting to be filed from on top of the burner, the CD revealed itself, gloriously labeled with phrases like "belly_web", "remodel_web", "cruise_web", and "blog images".
</p>

<p>
It's not everything, but it's a start. The belly photos I'd been trying to re-construct for the <a href="/blog/archives/pregnancy/index_fulltext.html">pregnancy archives</a> were all there. <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/annie/annie.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/annie/annie.html','annie','scrollbars=yes,width=500,height=670');return false;">Annie's memorial pictorial</a> was there. Our trip to <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/images/mechanicsburg/me.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/images/mechanicsburg/me.html','mcbg','scrollbars=yes,width=500,height=620');return false;">Mechanicsburg</a>. The photos from our "last hurrah" cruise and kitchen remodel (links coming as soon as I rebuild the ~ lori and al ~ blog). As soon as  I finish uploading, I can go back to bed.
</p>

<p>
Of course, that's when Austen will wake up.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Our Newborn is No Longer Newborn-Sized</h3>

<p>
When Austen was born, he was a very average newborn size&#8212;and next to me and Al, he was downright tiny. We could hold him in one arm with no trouble whatsoever. He wore Newborn size diapers and Newborn size clothes. Many of his 0-3 month sleeper suits were too big. At six days old, his head circumference was in the 10th&#8212;the 10th!&#8212;percentile, news that almost made me wish I'd been able to have a vaginal birth. His height and weight were somewhere around the 16th or 17th percentile.
</p>

<p>
At his one-month checkup (which he got at 5 weeks old), Austen had lept into the mid-30s percentilewise and was fast approaching 11 lbs. It was around this time that I remarked to Al that had the Incredible Hulk been born rather than developing as the result of an overdose of gamma radiation, Austen is probably what he would have looked like. I could swear I could see Austen's clothes shrinking and ripping as his little body expanded.
</p>

<p>
At 8 weeks&#8212;just after the big blizzard&#8212;I had to make an emergency run to the Baby Depot because Austen outgrew even the biggest of his 3-month sleeper suits, and both of the 6-month sized ones we got from nj and Morrisa were in the wash, the victims of spit-up and diaper leaks. He never even got to wear a few of the 8-11 lb. onesies his cousins made for him at our baby shower, and I think he only wore the suits his godmom bought him for New Year's a couple times each.
</p>

<p>
Over the past three weeks or so my back has started to ache so badly that it often wakes me up at night, and I began to think that perhaps Austen was expanding faster than I could build up the muscle strength with which to lift and carry him. (For those of you thinking, "lift with your knees, not your back!", I've been doing that, and now my knees hurt, too.) We knew Austen had to be at least 12 lbs. because of the way his clothes fit, but since our pediatricians' office is quite busy, he won't be weighed officially until he gets his two-month checkup... at three months. We decided to try the step-on-the-scale-alone-and-then-step-on-with-the-baby method after his bath on Sunday to get an approximate weight. Ladies and gentlemen, that scale said he weighed 15 POUNDS. Granted, this probably isn't a very accurate method, but as my friend Shannon said recently... holy crap, Batman! 
</p>

<p>
Austen is 10 weeks old today, and he's now straining the Velcro tabs on his size 2 Huggies. The snaps on his 6-month suits are about to pop around the diaper area, and they already have around his neck. 
(Like both Al and me, Austen's torso is long for his overall height, so he still has a little room in the suit legs as long as he doesn't point his toes.) Everyone who sees him comments on how big his cheeks are, and every woman who even peeks into the stroller&#8212;complete strangers on streetcorners, I'm talking about&#8212;asks me if I'm breastfeeding.
</p>

<p>
It's starting to wig me out a little. All I can do is reassure myself that Austen's healthy, alert, and interactive. He sleeps and eats well. He poops and pees normally. And he's super cute.

I now understand why mothers are always talking about eating their babies&#8212;noshing on chubby thighs, swallowing cute little cheeks whole, nibbling on tiny ears. It's because BABIES SMELL SO DARN TASTY.

I was just outside walking the baby around my neighborhood so I'd have a break from nursing, and as I walked down 21st Street toward Cherry, a  girl hung out the window of a school bus&#8212;A SCHOOL BUS!&#8212;and screamed "WHITEY!" at me. A very large, seemingly very angry boy hung out the adjacent window and screamed, "FUCKING CRACKER!" At me, a woman pushing a stroller. Out the window of a school bus.

I'm still shaking my head over it.

<h3 class="title">Sunshine Day</h3>

<p>
 When I was a kid growing up in Massachusetts, we'd always look forward to the day when you could finally go outside without your coat after a long winter. Usually that day would be in the 50s, a temperature that would cause you to don your coat in fall but that in spring felt wonderfully warm. Today was that day here in Philadelphia. 
</p>
<p>
I managed to get outside for no less than *three* walks today, which probably accounts for my good mood despite a relatively sleepless night. (The sleeplessness was my fault, not the boopster's&#8212;he slept for about six hours straight.) Austen was also in a fabulous mood today, whining only rarely and crying only once, if I remember correctly. [Aside: It always bugs me when people ask if Austen is a &quot;good baby&quot;, as if there's such a thing as a &quot;bad baby&quot;, but I suppose the people who ask are imagining a string of days like today when they think &quot;good&quot;.] Austen seems so far removed from the squawking little alien we brought home from the hospital 11 weeks ago. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/alert_in_stroller0215.jpg" alt="Austen, alert in his stroller" width="240" height="257" class="inline-right" galleryimg="no">It's not just a size thing, although he is, admittedly, huge. It's that he's alert and hyperinteractive and vocal and happy. There's more to him now than just sleeping, eating, and crying. He now has smiling and singing and flailing to his very own iTunes playlist in his repertoire. He spent an amazing amount of time awake in the stroller today, which made the walks even more enjoyable. And to top it off, we explored a new neighborhood and took some photos for <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town_II/">about town II</a> (I'll post them over the next few days). Yay, it's a sunshine day!

<h3 class="title">Friday Miscellany</h3>

<p>
 Herewith, some random observations that have been on my mind for a while and which I have not managed to blog about before now: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reading Material</strong><br> 
I don't know what I was thinking when I stopped at the library the other day; I'm still not done with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375705244/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Founding Brothers</a>, I haven't finished the February issue of Martha Stewart Living (although like all good porn, MSL is pretty timeless), and I'm drowning in Wall Street Journals (I find those crazy pro-business conservatives so amusing!). Luckily both of the books I wanted, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060195916/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Chain of Command</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594200408/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">It's My Party Too</a>, were checked out. Of course, yesterday I added another title to my list after the TiVo refused to cooperate and changed to CNN's interview with the author instead of Your Weather Today on the Weather Channel: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312320906/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Honeymoon With My Brother</a>, by   Franz Wisner . Sounds like my kind of book (note to self: mention it to brothers Eric &amp; Matt, who've also traveled the world together).
</p>
<p>
<strong>And Marijuana is Still Illegal?</strong><br>
In the WTF department: A <a href="http://www.budextra.com/" target="a8_win">new beer</a> from Budweiser with caffeine, guarana, and ginseng. Rather than &quot;beer with something extra&quot;, call it &quot;Red Bull with alcohol&quot;.
</p>
<p>
<strong>WTF Part II</strong><br>
Last evening Al took Austen out for a walk so I could get some work done, and the plastic cover he put on the stroller to keep Austen warm &amp; cozy blew  off. A  woman helped Al retrieve it and then exclaimed over the cuteness of the baby. &quot;I wonder if he'll grow up to run a dry cleaners or a restaurant?&quot; she said. When Al related the story, it took me a minute to realize why she identified those two particular possibilities. Weird that both Al and I would experience racial prejudice in the same week (the same week we happened to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00068S404/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle</a>, which identifies&#8212;and pokes fun at&#8212;so many racial stereotypes).</p>
<p>
<strong>What is <em>Life</em> Teaching These People?</strong><br>
Speaking of weird things people have said to us about Austen, in the first two weeks of his life no less than three women&#8212;at different times and places&#8212;remarked on his cuteness and then followed up with, &quot;who would ever want to harm a baby?&quot; Uh, yeah. Luckily these comments stopped (for a while there every woman I met on a street corner asked instead, &quot;are you breastfeeding?&quot;), but then something weird happened in the La Colombe coffee store the other day: An old homeless gentleman was trying to engage the baristas in conversation, and in so doing he was blocking my access to the bar where the baristas set up everyone's coffee. The female barista brought this to his attention, and the homeless man turned to me and said, &quot;You know, I would never hurt your baby.&quot; When he saw the startled look on my face, he followed up with, &quot;you know why? Because then I would die.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; I replied. &quot;At my hands.&quot;

<h3 class="title">The News From Babyland</h3>

<p>
The title of this post is what I say to Austen when he babbles at me while getting his diaper changed: "Are you giving me the news from Babyland? Well, what's the scoop? Give me the dish!" Here's what's been going on:
</p>

<p>
<strong><img src="/blog/images/crazy_hair.jpg" width="225" height="149" class="inline-left" alt="Austen with crazy scientist hair" />A sign that perhaps I should dial back the junk food consumption</strong><br />
Al, while changing Austen's diaper: "There's a little spot of poop on Austen's onesie. Do you think I should change it?<br />
Me: "Nah, not if it's just a spot."<br />
&lt;LATER&gt;<br />
Me: "Yeah, good call on not changing the onesie. That's not poop&#8212;it's chocolate."
</p>

<p>
<strong>Once a dad...</strong><br />
Last Friday night I was still awake (and working in the living room) when Al got home from hockey. I heard the garage door open, but I didn't notice if it shut or not. I know I didn't hear Al come in. Next thing I know, I hear Al shrieking. Thinking that he's being attacked in the back alley, I leap out of my chair and race down to the garage... where I find him struggling with the car seat base in the back seat of the car. The shriek was a shriek of frustration.
</p>

<p>
<strong><img src="/blog/images/eating_hands.jpg" width="225" height="150" class="inline-right" alt="hands... yum!" /></strong>"Did I wake you up?" he asks. Me: "No, I was working. I thought you were being attacked... I... I need a moment." Because my emotions are very close to the surface these days (closer than usual, even), and I can't shake the image of my husband being hurt or killed, I start to cry. Al takes me in his arms... and starts to pat me rapidly on the back. I lift my head off his shoulder and start laughing. "That only works with the baby," I say.
</p>

<p>
<strong>And for dessert?</strong><br />
While I've been feasting on chocolate, Austen has been feasting on his hands. (Apparently I'm not the only one to whom they look tasty.) He has them as an appetizer before meals, for dessert after eating, and occasionally as a mid-meal palate cleanser. The drool is starting to puddle on the floor around him.
</p>

<p>
<strong><img src="/blog/images/sitting_up.jpg" width="150" height="225" class="inline-left" alt="Austen camping out on the couch" />No more slouching, but lots of tipping over</strong><br />
Austen's latest obsession, besides his hands, is with sitting up. The bouncy seat he used to love hanging out in is no longer in fashion, as it only allows him to recline at an angle. He either cries when we put him in it, or spends the entire time in it struggling to sit up. This week I was able to sit him up on the couch by himself a few times, although eventually he'd keel over to one side or the other, hands in mouth.
</p>

<p>
<strong>I want to be a part of it!</strong><br />
Yesterday we made the trip we'd planned to make last Saturday but cancelled after getting very little sleep the night before: We drove up to NYC to see Christo's gates. It was Austen's first trip to New York (and our car's), and it went pretty smoothly. As for the gates, they were more impressive than I'd imagined they would be. I'll be posting the photos we took over at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/">~ lori and al ~</a> later this week.
</p>
