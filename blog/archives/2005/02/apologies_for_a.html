<p>
To those of you who started visiting avocado8 during the pregnancy (or the election; they were going on at the same time)&#8212;and also to those who've been reading this blog for years&#8212;I want to apologize. Not for all the broken links, but for blogging about all the broken links. Just because they're tormenting me doesn't mean they should be tormenting you.

To attone for my recent bout of manic-depressive blogging, I offer this photo of Al and the Beaner watching the Super Bowl last night. (Too bad the Eagles didn't win!)

<p>Too cute! Don't worry about the blogging - I would be depressed too if I lost my whole web existence. </p>
