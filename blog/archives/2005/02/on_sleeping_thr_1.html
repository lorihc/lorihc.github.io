<h3 class="title">More On Sleeping Through the Night</h3>

<p>
Austen slept for 7 hours straight on Saturday night (and I didn't soak the sheets with breastmilk!). It was lovely, for a couple reasons: (1) I also got to sleep for 7 hours straight, and (2) I didn't end up lying awake in bed at 4:30 in the morning thinking about missing files.
</p>

<p>
This morning Austen woke after only 4 hours, and after an only partially-successful attempt at feeding him in the side-lying position, I found myself awake&#8212;with pasty mouth, burning eyes, and swirling thoughts. I finally managed to finish the feeding at 4:45, but despite a desperate desire to get back to sleep, I couldn't help mourning lost belly photos.
</p>

<p>
And then I thought, "I *know* I burned a CD off my Windows machine before the baby was born." So I got up, went downstairs, and prepared to pry open the CD burner in search of it. No need: When I removed the stack of papers waiting to be filed from on top of the burner, the CD revealed itself, gloriously labeled with phrases like "belly_web", "remodel_web", "cruise_web", and "blog images".
</p>

<p>
It's not everything, but it's a start. The belly photos I'd been trying to re-construct for the <a href="/blog/archives/pregnancy/index_fulltext.html">pregnancy archives</a> were all there. <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/annie/annie.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/annie/annie.html','annie','scrollbars=yes,width=500,height=670');return false;">Annie's memorial pictorial</a> was there. Our trip to <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/images/mechanicsburg/me.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/images/mechanicsburg/me.html','mcbg','scrollbars=yes,width=500,height=620');return false;">Mechanicsburg</a>. The photos from our "last hurrah" cruise and kitchen remodel (links coming as soon as I rebuild the ~ lori and al ~ blog). As soon as  I finish uploading, I can go back to bed.
</p>

<p>
Of course, that's when Austen will wake up.

<p>I don't know if this might help, but maybe you could ask the regulars of your blog site to search their temp. internet files for your pictures.<br />
It's a long shot, but hey.. worth the try.</p>

<p>I did consider doing that, but as you say, it's a long shot. I think once I've exhausted all the possible backup CDs, I'll compile a list of what's still missing and see if anyone's got it floating around in their cache. Thanks for the suggestion!</p>

<p>YAY!  I was kind of out of touch with blogs in January, so I hadn't caught up with yours, and I was distraught to see the notice about your server getting blown away...I'm glad you were able to recover so much of it!</p>

<p>Did you ever find out who was responsible for deleting the files, and why, and what their GPS coordinates are for a targeted strike?</p>
