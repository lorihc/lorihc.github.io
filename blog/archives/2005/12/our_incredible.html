So I'm now 100% positive that the reason for Austen's cranky night&#8212;and the two 12+ hour nights on either side of it&#8212;was that he was having a growth spurt. When I tried to dress Austen on Friday, I had trouble getting his sweater over his head. We thought it was a fluke, that maybe the sweater had shrunk, but after three days of *every* shirt and sweater getting stuck, his pants and pajamas unsnapping whenever he moves, and his hat barely reaching over his ears, it's time to face facts: he grew. I couldn't get his beautiful new Jacadi wool coat zipped today without taking off the button down shirt he was wearing underneath it, for crap's sake.

I fear that all his lovely 12-18 month size clothes will be put in the Give Away pile soon. &lt;sigh&gt;

<p>Sam is in a similar boat -- already in 9-12 month clothes though he just turned 5 months yesterday.  I put on a couple of sleepers that swamped him only a couple of weeks agoa, and now they look like high-waters.  </p>

<p>As for heads, I can appreciate clothes not fitting over them as poor Sam has inherited the big head genes from both sides -- John's mom's family and all of my relatives/me.  sigh.  The pediatrician even went so far as to measure both my and John's head at our 4 month appointment.  </p>
