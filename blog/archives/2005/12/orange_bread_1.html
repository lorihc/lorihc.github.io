<h3 class="title">Orange Bread</h3>

<p>
The holiday baking has officially started in the Hylan-Cho household: I made Orange Bread this morning. I don't know if this recipe was designed to be a holiday treat, but it's something I always associate with Christmas because that's when my mom makes it.

Mom sent us some last year with a note on it that said "remember that this is a dry bread, so it needs butter", which puzzled me a bit. Although a piece of this bread tastes spectacular with some softened lightly salted butter pasted around at least three of its four sides, I've never had a batch come out dry. Quite the opposite, in fact. Maybe mom has modified her recipe over the years? In any case, this is the one I'm following, and it's wonderful. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Orange Bread</strong>
</p>

<p>
1 pkg. (8 oz.) pitted dates<br />
2 c. flour<br />
1 t. baking powder<br />
1 t. baking soda<br />
1 c. sugar<br />
1/4 t. salt<br />
2 c. orange juice<br />
1 egg<br />
1 T. olive oil<br />
1 t. vanilla<br />
1/2 c. orange peel (from 2-3 oranges)
</p>

<ol style="margin-left:0px;padding-left:0px">
<li>Chop the dates, splitting lengthwise first and then crosswise. (If you just chop them crosswise, you'll have rings in which flour will get stuck.) Toss with the flour.</li>
<li>With a sharp knife, cut the peel off the oranges and slice into thin strips. Try to get as little of the white pith as possible. (You can also use a lemon zester to generate ultra-thin peel strips, but it takes a little more effort and might take more oranges.)
<li>Sift together the powder, soda, sugar, and salt and add to the flour and date mixture.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl or large measuring cup, mix the orange juice, egg, oil, vanilla, and  orange peel.</li>
<li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix gently but thoroughly.</li>
<li>Pour batter into a 9x13 pan and bake at 350&deg; for about 45 minutes, or until the top is a rich honey brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
</ol>

<p>The dates are pretty key to the recipe, though the cake (it's more cake than bread, really) is nice on its own. If you can't substitute another fruit, like raisins, I would try baking in a smaller pan, perhaps 10x10 or 9x9.</p>

<p>hi Lori,<br />
sorry, I didn't see a temp to bake this bread at. I'd totally love to give it a whirl since I bought pitted dates to make dingbats but forgot the rice krispies so I can't make that.<br />
