<h3 class="title">Get Outta My Dreams (and Into My Blog)</h3>

<p>
Last night I had my third dream about <a href="http://www.dooce.com/" target="a8_win">Dooce</a>. In addition to the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/000336.html">girls' night out</a> dream I had a couple weeks ago, I have also dreamed:
</p>

<ul>
<li>That my friend Heather introduced me to Dooce, and Dooce replied, "are you the one who sends me all those dorky e-mails?"</li>
<li>That Dooce, <a href="http://www.blurbomat.com/" target="a8_win">Jon</a>, and I were nightclub-hopping in Minneapolis (how we came to be there I don't know, since the Armstrongs live in Salt Lake City and I live in Philadelphia, but it was definitely Minneapolis). As we ran from club to club, Jon and I talked about him helping me with a project I'm going to be doing that involves XML and XSL. I worried that Jon seemed to want to take over the whole project (I wanted to do most of the work myself), and that I was going to catch some nasty disease from running barefoot through Minneapolis' garbage-strewn and sludge-covered alleys.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the record:
</p>
<ul>
<li>I <strong>am</strong> a dork.</li>
<li>I will be working on a project that involves XML and XSL soon, but as he doesn't know who the hell I am (and because I think I have the situation well in hand), I won't be asking Jon for help. I <strong>will</strong> be asking my mom to help me watch the baby, however. </li>
<li>I have been to Minneapolis several times, and I have never even seen an alley there, much less a sludge-covered one.</li>
<li>What happened to my shoes, <strong>I have no idea</strong>. </li>
</ul>
