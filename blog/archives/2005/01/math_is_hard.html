Al and I are watching that new show Numbers right now&#8212;or at least, Al is. I'm only half-listening to it and mocking it periodically while I write a blog post on breast milk. I'd had high hopes for the show, but Al reminded me that it was on CBS, home of CSI (which practically destroyed my longtime fascination with forensic science). I should have listened to him and lowered my expectations... though I'm not sure I could have gotten them low enough. This show is freakin' awful.
