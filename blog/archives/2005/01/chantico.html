<h3 class="title">Chantico!</h3>

<p>
I've never been a fan of Starbucks' hot chocolate&#8212;or of any hot chocolate that's made with syrup, for that matter&#8212;but today they've introduced something they call a "drinking chocolate" (very European), and it's outstanding. The banner ads for the drink, called Chantico, refer to it as (if I remember correctly) "a cup of chocolatey chocolateness, with extra chocolate on top." That about sums it up. They serve it in little 6oz. cups, which is plenty&#8212;it is indeed very intense, and those 6oz. pack 390 calories.
</p>

<p>
I sampled the stuff last week at the Starbucks at 34th &amp; Walnut, but my Starbucks (the one at 20th and Market) didn't get it until today, so I only got the full-size serving this morning. I was thinking as I drank it (without the lid; somehow, it tastes better that way) that it was so chocolatey that it'd be hard to drink two in one day, but of course by the afternoon I was craving more. I came up with this reasonable home-made facsimilie, which is less expensive but more labor-intensive:
</p>

<p>
4 squares Trader Joe's Pound Plus Bittersweet Chocolate<br />
4 oz. 2% milk
</p>

<p>
Melt chocolate in a 1 qt. saucepan over very low heat, stirring frequently until smooth. Meanwhile, heat milk in the microwave for about 30 seconds. When chocolate is completely melted, pour about 1 oz. of milk into pan and stir until chocolate is completely smooth again. Repeat, adding 1 oz. of milk at a time. Leave on heat for another minute or two until chocolate is hot. Pour into small mug and enjoy.
</p>

<p>
This, of course, is just the way I made it; any good-quality dark chocolate would probably work just as well, as would whole milk instead of 2%. I imagine that 1% or skim, however, wouldn't be quite the same.
</p>
