<h3 class="title">I Hate That Fucking Sling</h3>

<p>
On the advice of a coomenter, and because I'm willing to try just about any solution that costs less than $40, I went out and got a NoJo BabySling. Oh, how I hate that fucking sling. It's supposed to be SO WONDERFUL for the baby that on top of feeling thoroughly frustrated by my inability to get the damn thing on and him in it at all, much less without hurting my back and shoulder, I also end up feeling guilty that I'm denying my child this incredible developmental experience. The only factor mitigating that guilt is that Austen so obviously hates the sling, too. Of course, the knowledge that I'm causing his frantic screaming by trying to wedge him into the freakish contraption brings on an even bigger tidal wave of guilt and insecurity, not to mention a flop sweat.
</p>

<p>
The "instructional" video that came with the sling (which, like the chapter devoted to babywearing in Dr. Sears' Baby Book, is more promotional than instructional) says that with a little patience, babywearing will become easy and enjoyable. I already suspected that I was too impatient to be a parent, but thanks, Dr. Sears and NoJo for making me feel too stupid for the job on top of it.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, I'm trying, but I don't know how many more chances I can give this fucking piece of crap before I toss it into the fucking fireplace.

<p>Try this: If you have a pair of overalls, put them on. Put Austen on your chest, cover him with the bib and then connect the bib hooks. This is pretty much idiot-proof (i.e., I did it, and I have NO patience at all). I used to go everywhere with my kid like that, and he grew up to be resentful and critical of me, anyway. So don't think anything you do will ever be enough - it won't.</p>

<p>I tell mine that's what therapists are for.</p>

I hated the Sling too! - some one gave it to us and it was awful. I figured it was cause i am so big that it just never fit us right, but your so skinny, it probably only fits one body type and if your not it, it's not comfortable.</p>

<p>I know its expensive but we did like the baby bjorn. If you can find one used its a lot cheaper. Heck if you lived closer I'd loan you ours since I won't be needing it for a while. Try out someone elses, or try one on at Babies R Us with Austen and see if it can work for you.</p>

<p>BTW congratulations on Austen. He is so beautiful.</p>

<p>Cheers<br />

<p>I remember those days. My son is now 13 and we bonded without a sling, I promise you. Every baby is different. Mind loved the mechanical swing, it always calmed him down and frequently put him to sleep. I had some frontal carrying device that seemed to hang his entire body weight from one of my wimpier neck vertebrae (a Snugli maybe?) so I gave up on that fairly quickly. Later I got something called a Sarah's Ride that sort of balanced him on one hip and worked pretty well for us. Mainly, hang in there.</p>

<p>We have a Baby Bjorn (I'm wearing it right now, actually), and I really like it -- but it does occasionally hurt my mid-upper back, it's a bit awkward to do chores in, and I can't nurse in it. The sling purported to solve all those problems, but in my limited experience, it only solved the nursing problem while causing more pain and frustration than it was worth.</p>

<p>Regarding size, I think that it almost doesn't matter what size you are -- if you're nursing, you've got huge (and likely sore) boobs, and trying to get the kid into a sling without knocking them around is impossible. Youch!</p>

<p>I think I'll stick to the Bjorn, sitting down while nursing, and the stroller for walks around town. :)</p>
