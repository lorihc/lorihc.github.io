<h3 class="title">The Borg and The Bunny Dip</h3>

<p>
Today I have two observations on parenthood: one from me, and one from Al. See if you can guess which one is which:
</p>

<p>
<b>Observation #1: Austen is like the Borg. </b>Not in that he's trying to assimilate everything and everyone, but in the way that once you use a weapon against the Borg, it adapts, and that weapon is never effective again. This accurately describes our experiences in trying to get Austen to sleep each night. There's not much that's routine yet in our house, but if there's one thing we can count on, it's that Austen will go ballistic&#8212;whimper, scream, nurse, thrash, wimper, scream, repeat&#8212;sometime between 8pm and 10pm and stay in that mode until midnight or 1am, when he drops peacefully off to sleep, looking so sweet that you can't quite believe he ever cries or even soils a diaper. In trying to get him into this peaceful sleep state, we have tried swaddling, rocking, walking, side-lying, pacifiers, shhhing, turning on the vacuum cleaner, driving up and down I-95, and drowning out his sobs and screams with our own. What works one night won't work the next... but it might work again next Thursday with some slight modifications.
</p>

<p>
<b>Observation #2: In order to get anything done while wearing the Baby Bjorn, you must become proficient at the Bunny Dip. </b>Remember A Bunny's Tale, that TV-movie based on Gloria Steinem's experiences as an undercover Playboy Bunny, with Kirstie Alley as Gloria Steinem? Anyway, one of the things Gloria learns as part of her Bunny training is how to place a drink in front of a patron without her boobs popping out of her costume. Instead of bending forward at the waist as any normal waitress would do (and as the waitresses at Hooters do in hopes that their boobs *will* pop out of their costumes), Bunnies are taught the Bunny Dip: standing with your right hip adjacent to the table and balancing a tray in your left palm, you remove the drink with your right hand, slide your right foot forward, arch your back, reach behind you, and place the drink in front of the gentleman. 
</p>

<p>
A similar maneuver is required when putting away laundry, loading the dishwasher, and doing other household chores while wearing the Baby Bjorn. The Baby Bjorn Dip goes something like this: standing with your right hip adjacent to the dresser and holding baby's butt through Bjorn with your left palm, slide your right foot forward, arch your back, reach behind you, and place the sock in the drawer. Unfortunately, performing this move while wearing a Baby Bjorn rather than a Bunny costume won't earn you any tips.

<p>I love these two observations! I think the borg comment is from Al and the bunny dip is from you.</p>

<p>Regarding the sling, we've talked about getting one, and every time I have to carry the kid around the house while nursing, it moves into the Must Have Right Now column. Like all baby products (diaper pails, nursing pillows, etc.), there are some who love one brand/kind, and some who hate it. It's so individual. Some folks swear by the sling, and others swear by the Bjorn. I'm inclined to try both and see how it goes. I'll let you know.</p>

<p>Great post. Last night, I watched my ex-football player tough guy friend play poker with his 5 month old son in a Baby Bjorn: shuffle cards, nuzzle baby, open a beer, beat me unmercifully, kiss baby. It made me think how much these little people captivate us all and how useful the Bjorn is.</p>
