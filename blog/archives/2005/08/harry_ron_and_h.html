<p>
I just had to give a post here that title, since Al and I have taken to saying it to each other all the time now. (It was Al who pointed out to me that an amazing number of sentences in the Harry Potter series start with, "Harry, Ron, and Hermione", but J.K. Rowling also acknowledges it in her recent TIME Magazine article.) We've been listening to the books on the iPod (with a Y-adapter to accommodate two sets of headphones) at night, and I've been listening to the Half-Blood Prince on CD in the car when I run errands (I finished the actual hardcopy of the book a couple days after its release). I'm so glad that I've finally gotten Al hooked on Harry Potter&#8212;even if the allure for him has more to do with Jim Dale's voice characterizations than with the stories themselves.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the reason I'm posting about this is that there's a wonderful <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/opinion/31kaavya.html?th&emc=th" target="a8_win">editorial</a> in yesterday's New York Times about growing up with Harry. Read it before it gets archived.
