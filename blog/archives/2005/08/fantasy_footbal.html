<h3 class="title">Fantasy Football, Anyone?</h3>

<p>
When I was in junior high and high school, I thought I wanted to be the first woman head coach in the NFL. I watched football all the time, studied the plays, knew all the signals that the officials used (my favorite, for some reason, was the signal for clipping), and went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092214/" target="a8_win">Wildcats</a> in the theater (I now own it on video :). Somewhere along the line that dream died, probably when I went to college and got more interested in college football. I stopped watching NFL games consistently in favor of SEC matchups and New Year's bowl games. Of course, at some point I lost interest in all college games that didn't involve the University of Georgia, too, and by that time I'd lost touch with the NFL.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the first year Al and I started going out I noticed that Sundays were taken up with football. Al had a subscription to NFL Sunday Ticket, and he'd often watch several games at once on his giant TV. I tried to get interested, but I had trouble following games with all the constant channel-changing, so I'd usually just go out and do my own thing while he manned the remote.
</p>

<p>
By the following year I'd realized that fantasy football was the reason Al was more interested in watching snippets of several games rather than all of one&#8212;when you follow specific players, how they're doing matters more than the outcome of any one game or the fortunes of any one team. That year I was working in the kitchen while Al participated in a live fantasy draft in the dining room, and I advised him to take Peyton Manning for his QB. He waffled, but I said I had a good feeling about Manning, so with his time on the clock ticking down, he followed my advice.
</p>

<p>
That year, Al won his league, mostly thanks to Peyton Manning.
</p>

<p>
The next year we moved to Philadelphia a couple weeks into the NFL season. I didn't have errands to run (or a car to run them with) while Al watched football on Sundays, and in any case, I was starting to feel left out of all the football frenzy. I wanted to watch too, and with the same fervor that Al did. Al suggested I join a public fantasy league so I'd have a vested interest in watching. It turned out to be a brilliant idea&#8212;I was hooked on football again in no time. (I also ended up with the best record in my league, though I lost in the second round of the playoffs.)
</p>

<p>
I played my first full season last year, again in a public league with an auto-draft feature. For the uninitiated, "auto-draft" means the league's computer chooses players for all the teams in the league based on either a ranking that each team manager specifies, or based on a general ranking of players based on the previous year's stats (e.g., Peyton Manning was ranked #1 this year). I did the same this year, choosing auto-draft again mainly because I see how much work Al puts into preparing for his live draft (which he's doing right now, incidentally), and I wasn't sure I'd have time to work that hard.
</p>

<p>
I am curious about the live draft, however, and while Al and I like playing in different leagues (because we can both have some of the same players on our rosters, and because I think Al likes having a second roster&#8212;mine&#8212;to mess with), we wanted to try playing against each other. For that reason, we started a custom league on Yahoo! that will employ a live draft. If you're interested in trying out fantasy football, are already in a league but want to try a live draft, or just want a second shot at drafting Peyton Manning or Shaun Alexander, we'd love to have you in our league, which is called the <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/register/joinprivateleague?stage=1&league_id=545612&password=h00hah">cherrypickers</a>. Just click the link to <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/register/joinprivateleague?stage=1&league_id=545612&password=h00hah">join</a>. Our draft is scheduled for Friday, September 2 at 6:45pm EDT (3:45pm PDT).
