<h3 class="title">Tuna Curry... Who Knew?</h3>

<p>
Thanks to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ratphooey/" target="a8_win">ratphooey</a> for tipping me off about Trader Joe's Tuna Curry (Yellow). When she mentioned it, I first thought (a) she'd added the tuna herself, and (b) that she meant Indian curry, but I discovered that (a) the tuna's already in there, and (b) it's Thai. It's also delicious, especially with some Trader Jose's Harvest Hodgepodge frozen vegetables thrown in. I've tried it with TJ's frozen Jasmine rice (good), but I like it even better with the little microwaveable rice bowls I get at the Han Ah Reum (and which I assume are available at other Asian markets as well). Yummy!

<p>So glad you liked it!</p>

<p>I add extra tuna, and usually peas, and serve over rice I've cooked myself, usually brown basmati.</p>

<p>Maybe we'll have that for dinner tonight.</p>
