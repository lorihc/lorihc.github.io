It's been so long since I moaned about the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/02/my_entire_web_e.html">rm -r debacle</a>&#8212;and so many things have returned in the past six months&#8212;that you might have forgotten it happened. I haven't, and I've been waiting for an opportunity to reconstruct a few parts of the site that have remained missing. That opportunity has come, and one of the parts I'm working on is the <a href="/books/">book reviews</a>, most of which I've been able to salvage from <a href="http://web.archive.org/" target="a8_win">archive.org</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>'s cache.
</p>

<p>
I've moved them back to avocado8 (they were briefly at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/">lori-and-al</a>) and changed the database structure a bit, so if you have any old links to reviews, you'll need to update them. I'm also still in the process of adding back as many reviews as I can find, so not everything is there yet... but hopefully, it will be soon.
</p>

<p>
As I add new reviews in, I'll resume the practice of linking the book titles under "Additional Reading" on <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/">this blog's homepage</a> to the reviews. (If I haven't written a review yet, the title will still link to the Amazon.com page for the book.) In the meantime, let me know if you find any broken links or other weirdness in the reviews. Thanks!
</p>

<p>Lori, Al,</p>

<p>I read your kitchen remodel story, noted your comment about the under-cabinet lights.  You'd like a switch for them near the door.  How about a motion-detector light switch to replace the one that's not near the door?  Should work if current switch plate faces or is within X degrees (depends on model) of facing the door-in-question.  You can use them manually, too.  Available at Home Despot.</p>
