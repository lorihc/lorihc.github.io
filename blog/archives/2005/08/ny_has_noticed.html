<h3 class="title">NY Has Noticed Us</h3>

<p>
My brother-in-law forwarded us an article from Sunday's New York Times called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/14/fashion/sundaystyles/14PHILLY.html" target="a8_win">Philadelphia Story: The Next Borough</a>, and I finally got around to reading it. It's fairly upbeat about Philly's hipness, though it ends on a rather snarky note. (Why they asked a <em>Soho</em> gallery owner what he thought of Philly, I have no idea.) Anyway, the takeaway is that the artists and hipsters are coming, and that's a good thing for all of us.

<p>Only NY artists and hipsters could afford Northern Liberties these days.  The local ones, who deserve the credit for making the hood cool, have long since been priced out by the yuppies, who are never far behind the artists.</p>

<p>This is very true. If you were a budding real estate investor looking for the next up-and-coming neighborhood, I'd say "follow the artists." </p>
