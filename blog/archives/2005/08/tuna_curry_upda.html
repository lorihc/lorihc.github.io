<h3 class="title">Tuna Curry Update</h3>

<p>
I'd been thinking that <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/08/tuna_curry_who.html">the TJ's tuna curry</a> might taste even better if the extra veggies I'd been adding had a chance to soak in their own curry bath, so over the weekend I bought a can of coconut milk (the premium kind) and some green curry paste and mixed them with the remaining half bag of Harvest Hodgepodge vegetables, a couple dashes of fish sauce, and a couple tablespoons of brown sugar. After heating this mixture through, I stored it in the fridge for use with the TJ's curry.
</p>
<p>
On Monday night I scooped out some of the veggies and a little of the sauce, mixed them with a packet of the Yellow Tuna Curry, and served it over the Korean steamed rice. Yummy! I started to wonder, however, whether my green vegetable curry might taste even better mixed with the Red Tuna Curry. I hadn't tried the red variety yet because when <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ratphooey/" target="a8_win">ratphooey</a> recommended this gourmet bargain ($1.39!!), she'd mentioned that she preferred the yellow to the red. I think I would have, too, were it not for the special vegetable preparation, which, when mixed with the Red Tuna Curry and served over the TJ's frozen brown rice, totally knocked my (and Al's) socks off. We thought at first we might miss the potatoes (which are a tasty feature of the yellow variety), but the flavor was so good that we didn't. The brown rice turned out to be the perfect platform for the dish, better than both the TJ's frozen jasmine rice and the Korean steamed white rice.
</p>
<p>
I'm looking forward to experimenting with different combinations of vegetables, curries, and rices, though I really do think the proportions I used last night were perfect. The trick was to scoop out the vegetables from the green curry, but not very much of the sauce&#8212;whatever clings to the vegetables when the mixture is cold is about right when using only one packet of the TJ's red curry. When I heated the curry mixture (separate from the rice), it came out looking exactly like what you'd get in a Thai restaurant.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, when I calculated the cost of the  meal, the total came to about $3.50&#8212;for both of us. Can't beat that with a stick.

<p>That sounds yummy!</p>

<p>Yes, the Red Curry requires a little more messing with than the yellow, which is why I like the yellow better.</p>

<p>Because I am LAZY.</p>

<p>And EVERYTHING is better with brown rice.  Particularly brown basmati rice.  Mmm, nutty and delicious.</p>

<p>And now I am hungry all over again.</p>
