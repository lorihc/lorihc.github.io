<h3 class="title">Harry, Ron, and Hermione...</h3>

<p>
I just had to give a post here that title, since Al and I have taken to saying it to each other all the time now. (It was Al who pointed out to me that an amazing number of sentences in the Harry Potter series start with, "Harry, Ron, and Hermione", but J.K. Rowling also acknowledges it in her recent TIME Magazine article.) We've been listening to the books on the iPod (with a Y-adapter to accommodate two sets of headphones) at night, and I've been listening to the Half-Blood Prince on CD in the car when I run errands (I finished the actual hardcopy of the book a couple days after its release). I'm so glad that I've finally gotten Al hooked on Harry Potter&#8212;even if the allure for him has more to do with Jim Dale's voice characterizations than with the stories themselves.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the reason I'm posting about this is that there's a wonderful <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/opinion/31kaavya.html?th&emc=th" target="a8_win">editorial</a> in yesterday's New York Times about growing up with Harry. Read it before it gets archived.

<h3 class="title">Let's Sing Along With the Bees, Shall We?</h3>

<p>
The Beaner has a Pooh bear that sings (why is it that in-laws always buy NOISY toys for your kids? at least this one is cute...) a catchy little tune about bees: "The BEES in my shirt are shining brightly" &#8212; and here Pooh's shirt lights up with little bee outlines &#8212; "oh so LIGHTLY! shining BRIGHTLY! The BEES in my shirt are shining brightly, oh my twinkle BEES." Then Pooh says something like, "bees, bees, silly bees," followed by "Let's sing along with the bees, shall we?" (twice) and "buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz, etc." to the same tune. There's more buzzing (from the bees this time), a giggle, and an assertion that "oh, I think the bees LIKE you" before Pooh moves on to his second little ditty: "Bees twinkle brightly, that's what they do; bees twinkle brightly, that's what they do; bees twinkle brightly, that's what they do... and they also love to buzz." All very charming.
</p>

<p>
Until the bees invade your house, that is.
</p>

<p>
We knew our back deck had a bee problem as early as last summer, when I was growing tomatoes and peppers out there. Large wasps would hover around me as I watered the plants, and they stung my sister-in-law as she stood next to Al while he was grilling one night. We didn't know where they were coming from, but we figured there had to be a nest. 
</p>

<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, there were FOUR. Al found them when he finally got the combination of time and weather he's been waiting for to tackle his deck projects. He went through a can and a half of wasp and hornet spray taking them all out, though four or five bees survived and hovered around his head, asking for spare change with which to pay for a room, while he painted the railing. A couple got in the house, but we were able to shoo them back outside. 
</p>

<p>
Since Al had to move all the pots and outdoor furniture into the house to clear the deck for cleaning, I weeded out all the pots indoors while he scrubbed and painted outside. We agreed to put the white plastic outdoor tables&#8212;of which the bees seemed especially fond&#8212;out with the trash on Sunday night, though for some reason Al didn't put the matching chairs out with them.
</p>

<p>
The deck didn't dry in time to stain it on Sunday, and we decided we wanted to go with a different color of stain anyway, so the deck project was put on hold until next weekend. The pots, chairs, and decorative table all stayed inside (though I moved the three pots with actual flowers in them to the front garden). I was a little eeky about having the pots stay inside for so long because I found a weird little bug in one of them while I was weeding, but rather than have to re-prep the deck again next weekend, I figured I'd try to get over my bug phobia.
</p>

<p>
So Monday passed without event; the babysitter came and played with the Beaner while I worked in the living room with the pots. I didn't see any bugs. Then on Tuesday, while I was holding The Beaner and simultaneously checking my e-mail in the living room, I noticed a bee on the sliding glass door. I thought, "huh, I wonder how he got in here?" and started formulating a theory about the bee squeezing in through the weatherstripping between the doors. Then I saw another bee crawling on the sliding door track. I called Al and asked where the wasp spray was.
</p>

<p>
By the time I located the spray, stashed the Beaner in the Pack 'n Play in the bedroom, and returned to the glass door, there were no less than FIVE bees in sight. I sprayed them all, wigged out, and called Al again. He said he'd come home as early as he could, but since it was only 3pm, I was on my own for at least a couple hours. About 20 minutes later I spotted another bee crawling up the leg of one of the white plastic chairs, and a new idea occurred to me: Maybe it wasn't the <em>tables</em> the bees were so fond of. Maybe there was a nest UNDER ONE OF THE CHAIRS. Which, of course, were in the living room now.
</p>

<p>
I killed the bee on the chair and another that had been playing dead (but who really wasn't! faker!) next to the doormat with the spray, but I didn't want to ruin the lovely fabric window blinds by spritzing the one camped out there. I was also reluctant to use a fly swatter on him because a bee authority (OK, the guy who ran the lemonade stand at the Maryland Rennaissance Faire) once told me that bees can smell bee blood, and it drives them nuts&#8212;kinda like how sharks smell blood in the water and get all attack-y. If my theory about the nest under the chair was correct, then smashing the bee on the blinds could cause all his buddies to come swarming out for vengeance. Instead, I cowered in the basement and in the bedroom, hoping that the bees, who seemed half-starved and a bit lethargic, wouldn't realize that there were other rooms in the house (including a kitchen full of tasty treats like lemons and peaches).
</p>

<p>
When Al got home, he carefully inspected the white plastic chairs and confirmed my theory: one of them housed a fifth wasps' nest. He gingerly carried the chair outside, sprayed the nest... and watched another TEN bees fall out of it. He didn't manage to get the bee that had been hanging out on the blinds, but I discovered another corpse by the sliding glass door this morning, so I'm hoping all the little buzzers are accounted for.
</p>

<p>
Amazingly, none of us was stung.
</p>

<p>
I still can't get the Pooh bee songs out of my head, but now the words go something like this: Ohhhhhhhhhhh, BEES freak out Mommy, that's what they do; bees freak out Mommy, that's what they do; bees freak out Mommy, that's what they do... and they also love to nest. Bzzzzz!
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Beaner at Eight Months</h3>

<p>
When the Beaner was only a couple months old, it was hard to imagine a day when he would be big enough or coordinated enough to ride in the front of a grocery cart.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="cart1.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/cart1.jpg" width="360" height="240" galleryimg="no" />

</p>

<p>
It's weird to think that he'll be talking before long, and walking probably even sooner. (He's already standing up against the furniture and indicating that he wants to get down and walk around by diving toward the floor when someone's holding him.)
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="walking_assisted.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/walking_assisted.jpg" width="240" height="360" galleryimg="no" />
<img alt="standing_at_activity_board.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/standing_at_activity_board.jpg" width="240" height="360" galleryimg="no" />
</p>

<p>
He's now eating a surprising array of foods, including a little ice cream now and then; he even had his first taste of meat this weekend when Al gave him a bit of pork from his sandwich. (He tried salmon last weekend when he shared a few bites of my entree at a new restaurant around the corner... more on that later.) His new favorite food appears to be Cheerios, which he now gets as an appetizer while I defrost cubes of pureed nectarine, plum, peach, or banana for his breakfast. He actually started flailing his arms and legs in excitement when he saw me get out the yellow box on Friday morning&#8212;and he'd only seen it twice before that.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="eating_cheerios.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/eating_cheerios.jpg" width="360" height="240" galleryimg="no" />
</p>

<p>
The Beaner is now an odd mix of clingy and independent; he seems to want to be held (by me) all the time, and he cries when I leave the room or even move more than 20 feet away... and yet I know he can play quietly by himself for 15-20 minutes at a time (I've seen him do it), and he has hours of Mommy-free fun with our babysitter.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="reaching_in.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/reaching_in.jpg" width="360" height="240" galleryimg="no" />
</p>

<p>
For all the I-want-my-Mommy screaming that the Beaner does these days, I think it's actually Al who soothes him better. Al does what I always said I would do but sometimes can't manage when the clinginess and the crying overwhelm me: He talks to the Beaner as if he can understand every word, patiently and quietly explaining that we love him, that it's time for bed or that Mommy needs a break, and that delayed gratification is a wonderful thing.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="crying.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/crying.jpg" width="360" height="240" galleryimg="no" />
<img alt="al_and_austen.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/al_and_austen.jpg" width="360" height="240" galleryimg="no" />
</p>

<p>
The Beaner is as charming around strangers as ever; he tends to be super smiley when we're out in public (as long as he's in my arms or in the Bjorn), and people often ask us, "is he always this happy?" We usually say yes or "most of the time." No one really wants to know that he can turn into a monster with snakes coming out of his ears when he's really mad or overtired. (The poor girl I sat next to on the train from NYC on Friday evening got to witness the transformation from cute and smiley to seething and screaming when we passed that invisible, mutable line known as "bedtime". She was pretty shocked.) For some reason, however, people keep mistaking him for a girl&#8212;which is totally puzzling to us. Perhaps it's his longish hair? We're not sure, but it's only started happening recently.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="rosy_cheeks.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/rosy_cheeks.jpg" width="360" height="240" galleryimg="no" />
</p>

<p>
For a kid who started teething so early (3 months!), we've also been surprised by the lack of actual teeth in his mouth. He's got one coming in on the lower right side that looks like a canine, though canines aren't supposed to come in until the  upper and lower front teeth do, so we might be wrong about that. Otherwise, he's all gums (and all drool).
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="all_gums.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/all_gums.jpg" width="360" height="240" galleryimg="no" />
</p>

<p>
In the first few days and weeks of the Beaner's life, people asked me all the time how long I was planning to breastfeed him. I always said I'd play it by ear; it might be two months, six months, twelve months, or maybe more. Those first two months were so hellishly painful that it's a wonder I kept at it, but here we are at eight and a half months, and the Beaner hasn't had an ounce of formula since the day he was born. (Al tried to give him some once, and the Beaner refused it rather vehemently.) I still don't know how long we'll keep at it; some days I'll nurse him only once in the morning and once at night and think that we must be tapering off, only to have the next day be one where he wants to nurse every two hours. On the days he bites and pulls and claws and scratches, I think that I'll be glad when it's over. On the days he snuggles into me and strokes my shirt or my face, I know I'll miss the closeness when we finally make the break.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="at_custard_corral.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/at_custard_corral.jpg" width="360" height="240" galleryimg="no" />
</p>

<p>
Oh, and I think his height measurement at his recent checkup might have been off. He measured a little over 27", which means he really hasn't grown at all since his last visit and has dropped to about the 70th percentile in height. I suspect that he's actually a bit taller than the nurse gave him credit for, because he's now standing flat-footed in the exersaucer. As should be obvious from this photo, he's still in the 90th percentile for weight.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ratphooey/" target="a8_win">ratphooey</a> for tipping me off about Trader Joe's Tuna Curry (Yellow). When she mentioned it, I first thought (a) she'd added the tuna herself, and (b) that she meant Indian curry, but I discovered that (a) the tuna's already in there, and (b) it's Thai. It's also delicious, especially with some Trader Jose's Harvest Hodgepodge frozen vegetables thrown in. I've tried it with TJ's frozen Jasmine rice (good), but I like it even better with the little microwaveable rice bowls I get at the Han Ah Reum (and which I assume are available at other Asian markets as well). Yummy!

<h3 class="title">Return of the Book Reviews</h3>

<p>
It's been so long since I moaned about the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/02/my_entire_web_e.html">rm -r debacle</a>&#8212;and so many things have returned in the past six months&#8212;that you might have forgotten it happened. I haven't, and I've been waiting for an opportunity to reconstruct a few parts of the site that have remained missing. That opportunity has come, and one of the parts I'm working on is the <a href="/books/">book reviews</a>, most of which I've been able to salvage from <a href="http://web.archive.org/" target="a8_win">archive.org</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>'s cache.
</p>

<p>
I've moved them back to avocado8 (they were briefly at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/">lori-and-al</a>) and changed the database structure a bit, so if you have any old links to reviews, you'll need to update them. I'm also still in the process of adding back as many reviews as I can find, so not everything is there yet... but hopefully, it will be soon.
</p>

<p>
As I add new reviews in, I'll resume the practice of linking the book titles under "Additional Reading" on <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/">this blog's homepage</a> to the reviews. (If I haven't written a review yet, the title will still link to the Amazon.com page for the book.) In the meantime, let me know if you find any broken links or other weirdness in the reviews. Thanks!
</p>

The Beaner finally outgrew his second pair of doggie Robeez. I resisted the urge to buy another identical pair in size 12-18 months and instead got these charming goldfish. Aren't they (or at least, the one you can see) cute?

<h3 class="title">Tuna Curry Update</h3>

<p>
I'd been thinking that <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/08/tuna_curry_who.html">the TJ's tuna curry</a> might taste even better if the extra veggies I'd been adding had a chance to soak in their own curry bath, so over the weekend I bought a can of coconut milk (the premium kind) and some green curry paste and mixed them with the remaining half bag of Harvest Hodgepodge vegetables, a couple dashes of fish sauce, and a couple tablespoons of brown sugar. After heating this mixture through, I stored it in the fridge for use with the TJ's curry.
</p>
<p>
On Monday night I scooped out some of the veggies and a little of the sauce, mixed them with a packet of the Yellow Tuna Curry, and served it over the Korean steamed rice. Yummy! I started to wonder, however, whether my green vegetable curry might taste even better mixed with the Red Tuna Curry. I hadn't tried the red variety yet because when <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ratphooey/" target="a8_win">ratphooey</a> recommended this gourmet bargain ($1.39!!), she'd mentioned that she preferred the yellow to the red. I think I would have, too, were it not for the special vegetable preparation, which, when mixed with the Red Tuna Curry and served over the TJ's frozen brown rice, totally knocked my (and Al's) socks off. We thought at first we might miss the potatoes (which are a tasty feature of the yellow variety), but the flavor was so good that we didn't. The brown rice turned out to be the perfect platform for the dish, better than both the TJ's frozen jasmine rice and the Korean steamed white rice.
</p>
<p>
I'm looking forward to experimenting with different combinations of vegetables, curries, and rices, though I really do think the proportions I used last night were perfect. The trick was to scoop out the vegetables from the green curry, but not very much of the sauce&#8212;whatever clings to the vegetables when the mixture is cold is about right when using only one packet of the TJ's red curry. When I heated the curry mixture (separate from the rice), it came out looking exactly like what you'd get in a Thai restaurant.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, when I calculated the cost of the  meal, the total came to about $3.50&#8212;for both of us. Can't beat that with a stick.

<h3 class="title">Openings and Closings</h3>

<p>
A few weeks ago, I walked Al to work and then continued walking southeast toward Society Hill. I was on my way to check out a place my babysitter recommended called Homemade Goodies (on 5th between Lombard and South), but I figured that on the way I'd stop at The Inn on Locust and ask to see the bathrooms. I practiced my speech as I walked: &quot;I know this is going to sound insane, but we're thinking about remodeling our master bathroom, and every time we talk about the design, my husband says, 'I wish you'd seen the bathrooms at The Inn on Locust, because that's exactly what I want.' So I'm wondering: Would it be possible to see the bathroom in one of your rooms?&quot;
</p>
<p>
It might surprise my friends and readers to learn this, but I'm actually kind of shy/chicken when it comes to talking to strangers. I'd much rather keep to myself and interact with others only if absolutely necessary. After four blocks of practicing my speech, however, I was prepared to march up to the front desk at The Inn on Locust and sound like a total nut. Imagine my disappointment-mixed-with-relief when I arrived at Locust and 12th to find a padlock on the door and a business card from a real estate agent taped to the glass. I contemplated calling the agent, since I now wanted to ask another question besides &quot;can I see the bathrooms?&quot; (which I assume are still as they were): What happened?
</p>
<p>
I know businesses fail&#8212;heck, <em>most</em> businesses fail&#8212;but   as someone who hopes to open a business someday (more on that in a future post), I find myself wishing that more of the failures would post an explanation in their windows rather than a &quot;thanks for your patronage,&quot; a For Rent sign, or a real estate agent's business card. I want to know what happened, to learn from others' mistakes, to understand the business environment in my city. I'd love to know the story behind the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/07/food_news.html">closure of Hamburger Mary's and Club Dragonfly</a>; it always seemed busy at lunchtime, but perhaps that wasn't enough to keep it going. Would it have done better in the Gayborhood? Would The Inn on Locust, which was smack dab in the middle of the Gayborhood, have done better in Hamburger Mary's location? Perhaps the spillover from the nearby nightclubs, which would have been a boon to Mary's, were what doomed a boutique hotel full of business travelers who needed to get some sleep? I guess I'll never know.
</p>
<p>
In any case, the title of this post is Openings and Closings because Mary's and The Inn on Locust aren't the only businesses along my usual walking routes that have closed recently&#8212;and because several new and interesting businesses have sprung up to take their places. The most important opening (to us, at least) is Aya's Cafe, which took the place of Nick's Pizza on Arch between 21st and 22nd. We've been watching the new commercial stoves go in, the sign go up, and the interior get redecorated for the past couple months with much excitement. We love our neighborhood, but we've been saying since we moved in that if we could change one thing, it would be to add a small, independent restaurant or two. Aya's is exactly the kind of place we had in mind.
</p>
<p>
We tried Aya's, which is a Mediterranean BYOB, the first weekend it was open. They had a high chair for the Beaner, gave him his own bowl of baby carrots to nosh on (most of which he just dropped on the floor), and did a pretty good job of keeping plates, glasses, and silverware out of his reach despite the limited table real estate, so thumbs-up for baby-friendliness. The decor is really warm and inviting&#8212;a big change from Nick's&#8212;though I found the banquette that runs the length of the restaurant a little too high. The pillows that formed the backrest were great, but I couldn't sit with my feet flat on the floor (nor could I lean my elbows on the table comfortably, though I know that's considered bad manners anyway). I tried to balance the weight of my legs on my toes, but the edge of the banquette still bit into my thighs, and my back was sore from the balancing effort by the end of the meal.
</p>
<p>
As for the food, I had the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer (I didn't need so much cheese, but the mushrooms themselves were very good&#8212;similar to the kind I make for parties), and I think Al had a salad. For entrees, I had the grilled salmon, and Al had linguine with clams. The salmon had a wonderful kabob-like grilled flavor, but it was overcooked for my taste and slightly fishy. The cous cous it was served on was nutty, buttery, and just plain excellent, however, and the grilled red peppers were great (I wish there were more of them than the green and yellow squash, which didn't grab me the way the peppers did). Al's pasta was also a bit overcooked; I like <em>all</em> pasta al dente, but especially pasta that's served with clams. When your flavoring is chewy, your pasta should be, too. Caffe Teresa in Princeton gets it just right: When in doubt, lean more toward undercooked than over. Other than that complaint, Al reports that the dish was tasty. 
The best thing we had was the rice pudding we shared for dessert, which was served icy cold and sprinkled with ground pistachios. Creamy and refreshing. 
</p>
<p>
We left thinking that we'd surely go back, if for no other reason than to encourage a local business, but I notice we haven't been in a hurry. This is the problem with restaurants that are convenient but which don't serve food that knocks your socks off: You want them to stick around in case you need them, but it's hard to patronize them consistently when you don't love the food. Such was also the case with the Teriyaki Boy at Market and 20th, which closed this week; it was nice to have a fast food sushi/teriyaki place on the way home from Al's work&#8212;especially one that was open past 5pm&#8212;but the food wasn't so good that we wanted to go all the time. We're sad to see it go, but it was even sadder to see it empty all the time. I hope something even better ends up in its space.
</p>
<p>
Another sushi  (and perhaps tapas?) place we kept thinking we'd try but never did, Cha Cha Sushi (on 19th), closed a couple weeks before the Teriyaki Boy. We lamented the missed opportunity for about five minutes, or until we realized that a new place called Devil's Alley had opened up almost simultaneously around the corner on Chestnut. Now <em>there's</em> a place we'll be patronizing frequently. We went for the first time last week, mainly because Al had noticed that they had a platter of three BBQ sandwiches on the menu (one each of chicken, pork, and beef). The trio of BBQ sandwiches was an appetizer (Devil's Alley also serves a BBQ sandwich entree, but that's limited to only one kind of meat), so  Al chose a bowl of beans and the grilled sweet potato steak fries from the long list of side dishes to flesh out his meal. I had a really bad toothache that night and couldn't imagine eating a big meal, so I ordered a grilled caesar salad, which the waiter explained was a half a head of romaine thrown on the grill&#8212;&quot;it's warm, not cold&quot;&#8212;and then served with caesar dressing, parmesan cheese, croutons, and sun dried tomatoes.
</p>
<p>
The grilled romaine was FABULOUS, the BBQ sandwiches were huge (far bigger than their appetizer status would have suggested), and the sweet potato fries (with the blackened bits trimmed off) turned out to be the perfect dinner for the Beaner (Al couldn't finish them anyway because he was so stuffed from the sandwiches). I had assumed that the restaurant wasn't particularly baby-friendly because we weren't offered  a high chair&#8212;and I <em>was</em> offered a sharp knife with which to cut my salad despite the fact that the Beaner was strapped to my chest in the Bjorn within easy reach of any utensils (I declined in favor of eating the leaves with my fingers)&#8212;and this almost prevented us from returning with <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~vbg/blog/" target="a8_win">Val</a> on Thursday night. Memories of that grilled caesar salad kept floating through my brain, however, so we decided to go again despite the hardship of having to hold the Beaner.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, Devil's Alley <em>does</em> have high chairs,  they're perfectly OK with patrons parking strollers in front of the hostess stand, and they do have some wait staff with common (or at least kid) sense. This is a good thing, because I'm now totally hooked on the grilled goodness (or devilishness). My second salad was slightly smaller than the first, but every bit as tasty; the grilled vegetable platter we got to share was not extraordinary on its own, but it was excellent with the side of  chipotle ranch dressing that came with Al's special, the dry-rubbed wings. I plan to ask for a side of dressing next time I order the grilled veggies. 
I'd definitely have another glass of the Forrestville Riesling, and I can't wait to try some of the sandwiches and more of the sides. For his part, Al is sad that the wings were only a special and not a regular menu item, but the bright side of that is that he'll definitely get to try something new next time.
</p>
<p>
 I know I've already covered a lot of territory in this post, but I have one more opening to mention before I sign off&#8212;one that hasn't quite happened yet. In late winter the Midori Mart, a Japanese/Korean grocery and fresh fish market that had been between 21st and 22nd on Chestnut when we first moved to Philly and that had moved a block east not long after, closed its doors and posted a sign in the window. Not a &quot;for rent&quot; sign, not a &quot;thanks for your patronage&quot; sign, but something more encouraging: A &quot;Korean restaurant coming in April&quot; sign. When the end of April approached, a new sign went up that said &quot;Open in May&quot;. In June, that sign came down, and newspaper went up. We've been passing by periodically, looking for signs that the venture is still on, that a restaurant really will be opening sometime soon. This week I saw one: A new sign that said &quot;Waiter/Waitress Wanted.&quot; Woo hoo!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Independent Study</h3>

<p>
There's an interesting excerpt from Chris Whittle's new book, Crash Course, in this week's TIME Magazine&#8212;interesting because it captures what I think I found so frustrating about my K-12 school experience, and why if I could change one thing about the course of my life, it would have been to go to college at 16 rather than 17.
</p>

<blockquote>
By the sixth grade, let's assume only <em>half</em> of a student's time was spent in what we now think of as a classroom. Finally, by high school, imagine that <em>one-third</em> of a student's time was in a traditional classroom setting. (If you think this is overly radical, consider that many college students are in class fewer than 15 hours a week. They are only a few months older than high school seniors. Did something magically occur to make them more capable of independence?)
</blockquote>

<p>
[For me the answer to that would be "no"; if independence were the only thing college offered, I would wish I'd gone at age 5. I only wish I'd gone at 16 because I feel like at that age I could have handled all the other stuff that comes with college as well as benefitted from the freedom to choose my classes and how often I attended them.]
</p>

<p>
The excerpt also underlined for me some of the reasons I'm considering home-schooling Austen. (At the moment it's just an idea; we'll see what he needs&#8212;and what I'm capable of&#8212;four years from now.) I worry that public schooling these days is all about regulated curricula and standardized testing (or worse, that it will be like it was when I was a kid&#8212;not much unsupervised learning, but plenty of unsupervised bullying). Better than home-schooling, I'm thinking (and the excerpt seemed to support) might be something that Val and I were discussing this weekend: namely, a one-room schoolhouse or equivalent, which might provide a way for students of different ages to learn from each other.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, as you can see, I don't have a clear picture of what the ideal educational system would look like for Austen or any other kid... but this excerpt got me thinking. I'm not super keen on Whittle's writing style, but his ideas are interesting&#8212;enough that I'll probably end up picking up his book when it becomes available.
</p>

Whenever I think I'm not going to be able to make it through the day, Austen gives me the gift of a two-hour nap. Funny how a nap can improve one's outlook, even when someone else is doing the sleeping.

<h3 class="title">Fantasy Football, Anyone?</h3>

<p>
When I was in junior high and high school, I thought I wanted to be the first woman head coach in the NFL. I watched football all the time, studied the plays, knew all the signals that the officials used (my favorite, for some reason, was the signal for clipping), and went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092214/" target="a8_win">Wildcats</a> in the theater (I now own it on video :). Somewhere along the line that dream died, probably when I went to college and got more interested in college football. I stopped watching NFL games consistently in favor of SEC matchups and New Year's bowl games. Of course, at some point I lost interest in all college games that didn't involve the University of Georgia, too, and by that time I'd lost touch with the NFL.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the first year Al and I started going out I noticed that Sundays were taken up with football. Al had a subscription to NFL Sunday Ticket, and he'd often watch several games at once on his giant TV. I tried to get interested, but I had trouble following games with all the constant channel-changing, so I'd usually just go out and do my own thing while he manned the remote.
</p>

<p>
By the following year I'd realized that fantasy football was the reason Al was more interested in watching snippets of several games rather than all of one&#8212;when you follow specific players, how they're doing matters more than the outcome of any one game or the fortunes of any one team. That year I was working in the kitchen while Al participated in a live fantasy draft in the dining room, and I advised him to take Peyton Manning for his QB. He waffled, but I said I had a good feeling about Manning, so with his time on the clock ticking down, he followed my advice.
</p>

<p>
That year, Al won his league, mostly thanks to Peyton Manning.
</p>

<p>
The next year we moved to Philadelphia a couple weeks into the NFL season. I didn't have errands to run (or a car to run them with) while Al watched football on Sundays, and in any case, I was starting to feel left out of all the football frenzy. I wanted to watch too, and with the same fervor that Al did. Al suggested I join a public fantasy league so I'd have a vested interest in watching. It turned out to be a brilliant idea&#8212;I was hooked on football again in no time. (I also ended up with the best record in my league, though I lost in the second round of the playoffs.)
</p>

<p>
I played my first full season last year, again in a public league with an auto-draft feature. For the uninitiated, "auto-draft" means the league's computer chooses players for all the teams in the league based on either a ranking that each team manager specifies, or based on a general ranking of players based on the previous year's stats (e.g., Peyton Manning was ranked #1 this year). I did the same this year, choosing auto-draft again mainly because I see how much work Al puts into preparing for his live draft (which he's doing right now, incidentally), and I wasn't sure I'd have time to work that hard.
</p>

<p>
I am curious about the live draft, however, and while Al and I like playing in different leagues (because we can both have some of the same players on our rosters, and because I think Al likes having a second roster&#8212;mine&#8212;to mess with), we wanted to try playing against each other. For that reason, we started a custom league on Yahoo! that will employ a live draft. If you're interested in trying out fantasy football, are already in a league but want to try a live draft, or just want a second shot at drafting Peyton Manning or Shaun Alexander, we'd love to have you in our league, which is called the <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/register/joinprivateleague?stage=1&league_id=545612&password=h00hah">cherrypickers</a>. Just click the link to <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/register/joinprivateleague?stage=1&league_id=545612&password=h00hah">join</a>. Our draft is scheduled for Friday, September 2 at 6:45pm EDT (3:45pm PDT).

<h3 class="title">Education's in the Air</h3>

<p>
The very day that <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/08/independent_stu_1.html#c663">Michele commented</a> about Quaker schools on my <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/08/independent_stu_1.html">Independent Study</a> post, and I responded that the nearby Friends Select School would be at the top  of our list, cost permitting, I noticed that the cover story in this month's Philadelphia Magazine was a ranking of the area's top public and private schools. (This is probably no coincidence; what better time of year to write stories about education?) Since I'd failed to find any mention of tuition or fees (other than a few words on how to apply for financial aid, and who's likely to get it) on the <a href="http://www.friends-select.org/" target="a8_win">Friends Select website</a>, I thought I'd pick up a copy of the magazine in case the school and its tuition were mentioned. They were, and I'm afraid Friends Select is no longer at the top of the list.
</p>

<p>
I'm as encouraged as ever regarding the quality of the education Austen would get at Friends Select, which is number 28 on PhillyMag's list of top 50 private schools, but the tuition for day students is listed as $18,125. That's 10 times what my annual college tuition cost at the University of Georgia (granted, we're talking 15 years ago), and what a year of grad school at Stanford cost Al back in the mid-90s. There's no way we could afford that and still have money left over to send Austen to college. (I haven't actually run the numbers to see what we'd need to do to afford it&#8212;how much we'd need to set aside, what we'd have to do without, etc.&#8212;and I probably won't. I just object to K-12 education costs that high on principle.) The one upside to the high cost of Friends Select is that the average of the highest teacher salaries is $74,792, according to PhillyMag. I think of this as an upside because I believe teachers in general are underpaid, and private school teachers are usually paid less than public school teachers. At least some of the tuition money seems to be going to the staff.
</p>
<p>
Regarding <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/08/independent_stu_1.html#c665">Clem's question</a> about what my home-schooling curriculum would look like, I don't have a specific plan yet, aside from the plan to do a lot of reading on the subject over the next three or four years. I do know that I don't believe in pre-school education per se (though the <a href="http://www.greenetowneschool.org/montessori.htm" target="a8_win">Montessori</a>* approach mentioned in PhillyMag's &quot;The $12,000-a-Year Pre-School&quot; sounds close to my philosophy that play = learning), so aside from watching Sesame Street, singing everything from Aimee Mann to Ella Fitzgerald, reading books out loud, listening to Harry Potter and other audiobooks, and playing on the floor, I don't plan on educating Austen before age 4 or 5. [*Link goes not to the school mentioned in the article, but to the Montessori school that's just around the corner from our house.] This is actually one of many reasons why home schooling is appealing: If Austen doesn't have to compete to get into a public or private elementary school, I'll be less likely to cave to the prevailing societal pressure to start schooling before Austen is technically school age. 
</p>
<p>
One idea that sounds appealing, either on its own or as a supplement to  a home school curriculum, is online learning. More and more K-12 schools, both public and private, are offering courses online, which seems to me to be a good way for students to determine their own pace of learning and to be more self-directed while still getting the benefits of a tested curriculum and the guidance of a qualified educator. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, Austen could turn out to be more like his dad, who enjoyed classroom learning far more than I ever did, than like me, and thus he might tell us when he's 5 or 7 or 10 that he *wants* to go to a regular school. There's a brief profile of a student who decided to attend public high school &quot;after feeling he'd hit a wall with homeschooling&quot;  in the &quot;Tales Out of School&quot; story in PhillyMag, and I don't doubt that this would be likely with Austen as well&#8212;even if he turns out to be more like me&#8212;given that I'm probably unqualified to teach most subjects beyond the elementary level. I know I'll be relying on Al to give Austen an introduction to physics, for example, and I'll probably need someone else to handle biology, which I suck at. (For some reason I don't find botany nearly as confounding as biology, so I could probably cover that, if necessary). 
</p>
<p>
I'm probably getting a little ahead of myself here; I know that Austen will need to learn how to add and subtract before he learns algebra and calculus, so I probably shouldn't worry that my math skills are a little rusty. This is where downloading or purchasing some established home schooling curricula will really help, since I'm not exactly sure at this point what kids are expected to be learning at each grade level. To a certain extent, a little ignorance of expectations is a good thing&#8212;expectations can as often limit growth as encourage it&#8212;but I don't want my first mistake to be to overwhelm my child with too much information. 
</p>
<p>
ANYWAY! As usual, I'm overthinking this, I think. :)
</p>
<p>
One more thought on education before I conclude this post: I'm still not entirely clear on how the Philadelphia school system works, but I got a little information about it from two cashiers at Whole Foods and the woman behind me in line this morning. Apparently kids are assigned to schools by district, but there's also a certain amount of choice: My cashier said that there are special (magnet?) schools that kids can get into based on good grades, good attendance, or good behavior, and these are in addition to charter schools, which the woman behind me in line clarified are funded with public school money. You apparently apply to them (the charter schools, I mean) like private schools&#8212;and some have waiting lists a mile long&#8212;but they don't cost extra.  I obviously need to find out more if we're going to stay in Philadelphia for more than a few years, but that's a start.

<h3 class="title">Nine Months</h3>

<p>
After nine months of pregnancy, I'd started to believe that I was going to be pregnant forever. Now I can hardly remember being pregnant at all... but I'm starting to believe that Austen's going to be around for a while. What's hard to believe is that he has  now been on the outside roughly the same amount of time that he was on the inside. Some observations from Austen's ninth month:
</p>

<p>
<strong>We don't need no stinkin' bouncy seat. </strong>Austen's been sitting up on his own for a couple months now, but for some reason it didn't occur to me until a couple weeks ago that I could just <em>set him down on the floor</em> when I went to the bathroom. I think it was one of Dooce's anecdotes popping into my head one day&#8212;a story that involved Leta pulling things out of the bathoom drawers while Heather was on the toilet&#8212;that made me think, &quot;why am I still using the bouncy seat? It rests on the floor [due to Austen's bulk] instead of bouncing as advertised anyway these days.&quot; So now whenever I have to pee, Austen sits on the bathroom rug, happily pulling the toilet paper holder to his mouth like a microphone stand, and then unraveling as much of the roll as he can before I scoop him back up.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>We see teeth! </strong>That's definitely a canine coming in on the lower right, and we can now clearly see two more bottom teeth coming in. Austen's now chewing like a champ, too (mainly Cheerios, bread, rice, and pizza crust, though you can shove just about anything in there). Austen's eating so many different foods that it's hard to list them all anymore, and he's started eyeing whatever Al and I are eating, too. He actually tried some of my sweet potato-chipotle soup with mint cream when we were at Devil's Alley the other night, and the slow burn of the peppers didn't deter him one bit from begging for more. (I gave it to him.)
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<img src="/blog/images/parenthood/eating_bread.jpg" alt="eating bread at Kibbitz Down the Shore" width="240" height="360" />
</p>
<p>
<strong>At some point, I'm going to need to go on a diet. </strong>It just occurred to me today that hockey isn't the (sole) reason I'm pretty much able to eat whatever I want without gaining weight these days&#8212;breastfeeding is. Suddenly, continuing to breastfeed for another few months seems much more appealing, despite the teeth marks on my nipples. 
And speaking of breastfeeding, Austen has a goofy new behavior on that front. When we're at home I almost always nurse him in side-lying position, mainly because he usually falls asleep, and he's more likely to *stay* asleep if I just roll away from him instead of moving him somewere else. (We've returned to the habit of letting him nap in our bed; we just barricade him in with pillows and other parephenalia and listen closely for the sound of him waking up.) Anyway, sometimes instead of going to sleep, Austen will pop off, roll away and onto his tummy, give me a big, evil grin, and start <strong>stalking the nipple</strong>. He creeps forward on his elbows like a cat, grinning like a maniac the whole time, and then dive-bombs the boob. He thinks it's hilarious, so I usually let him do it a couple times before calling a halt to the nursing session (though the face-first position is surprisingly effective for milk delivery, it's uncomfortable for me&#8212;and annoying to boot, because he keeps popping off).
</p>

<img src="/blog/images/parenthood/austen_icecream.jpg" alt="austen eating ice cream at the custard corral" width="359" height="240" /><br />
Austen dives face first into my cone at the Custard Corral.
</p>
<p>
<strong>He waves! </strong>The weekend before last, I picked Austen up after changing his diaper and carried him into the bathroom with me so I could wash my hands. As soon as I flipped on the light, I saw Austen wave at us in the bathroom mirror. I stood there with my jaw hanging open for a couple seconds...and then I waved back. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I think we got our first word. </strong>Austen's been babbling ma-ma-ma-ma and da-da-da-da for a while now, but there haven't been any distinguishable words until today. I wasn't even sure he'd said what I thought he'd said when I first heard it this morning, but when he bumped his head again this afternoon, it was unmistakable: &quot;Ow.&quot; I'm just glad it wasn't &quot;fuck!&quot;, which is what I usually say.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We've reorganized the kitchen cabinets for Austen's benefit. </strong>When we remodeled the kitchen, we made a big deal out of planning where everything would go. We wanted maximum accessibility and usability, and we got it. Enter Austen, who now knows how to open cupboards and who will sit on the floor playing with whatever he finds in them. Baby safety is now ranked above accessibility and usability on the priority list, which mostly means that all glass items have been moved to upper cupboards. Oh, and the toaster has, too.

<strong>Val came to visit. </strong>Val, who last saw Austen 9 months ago, when he was just a lump inside my belly, got to meet him in person when she came down from Maine for a visit.  We walked all over town, stopped for some playtime in Rittenhouse Square,  ate at Devil's Alley and Morimoto (the funky booths turned out to be very adaptable to high chairs), and played on the floor in our living room. Fun! Val brought us some amazing homemade blueberry jam (made with wild Maine blueberries), plus some sweet L.L. Bean clothes for Austen. Look for photos of Austen in the sweater around Christmastime. :)

</p>
<p>
<strong>Austen's a hit in Chelsea. </strong>Earlier in the month Austen and I took the train up to NYC to meet up with Kristin, who was visiting for the day. We went on a major food binge, walking around to places that <a href="http://eggbeater.typepad.com/shuna/" target="a8_win">Shuna</a> recommended (plus a few places we found on our own, like the Chocolate Bar, where Kristin got Austen this cute &quot;chocolate baby&quot; t-shirt). Austen was a big hit in Chelsea; the bakers at Billy's came out to admire his rosy cheeks, and the host at Diner 24 played with him while Kristin and I sipped cocktails. (Photos from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/daywithkristin/">day with Kristin</a> on are on Flickr.)

<p>
<strong>There's now a baggie with some of Austen's hair in it. </strong>I've been wanting to cut Austen's Gollum strands off for a while now, and I spent the past couple weeks planning how I would do it so that he wouldn't look like he'd been mowed with a Flowbee. (I often cut my own hair, so I have some experience in this area.) Of course, when I finally got out the scissors on Sunday morning I discovered that babies cannot be expected to sit still while you move a sharp object toward their temples. We tried the distraction method advocated by the Baby Owner's Manual (there's a diagram of one parent holding a teddy bear in the baby's sight line while the other parent snips), but it didn't help much. Suffice to say that Austen's cut isn't particularly stylish, but at least the Gollum strands are gone.
