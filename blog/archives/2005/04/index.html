<h3 class="title">Travel Preparations</h3>

<p>
 We leave for San Francisco tomorrow at 6:45am. Part of me is happy/excited, and the other part is anxious because I have so many little things to do before we go.
</p>
<p>
The big things have mostly been done: laundry, packing, taking Austen to the doctor to make sure the hacking cough and snarffle-y nose he got from me weren't serious (they aren't). I still have to take a shower, clear off the camera's memory card and charge its battery, throw various toiletries into the suitcase (we bought a <a href="http://www.rei.com/online/store/ProductDisplay?storeId=8000&catalogId=40000008000&productId=47605838&parent_category_rn=40003717&vcat=REI_SEARCH" target="a8_win" class="style1">Wheely Beast</a> to use as a family suitcase so we'd have fewer things to carry), get the car seat out of the car, 
take the car into the shop, oil my shoes, find the card reader (or else the CD withe the camera software on it), and give the kid a bath. I think that's all...
</p>
<p>
 Meanwhile, between nursing  a sick baby round the clock (apparently sleeping through the night goes out the window when babies are sick), working, and trying to sort out our taxes, I haven't had time to blog about the daily doings. Here are the headlines:
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/heads_up_0403.jpg" alt="austen propped up on his elbows" class="inline-right">
<b>Austen rolled over for the first time this weekend. </b>He's also grabbing with more accuracy, propping himself up on his elbows when on his stomach, and raising himself from a reclining to a sitting position.
</p>
<p>
<b>I can finally fit into my size M+ Bravado nursing bras again. </b>This is something all the books I'd read (and the <a href="http://www.bravadodesigns.com/" target="a8_win"><span class="style1">Bravado website</span></a>) said would happen 4-6 weeks post-partum, but it took me 4 months. I'm not sure whether it's due to the fact that I'm making a final push to lose the remaining 12 pounds of pregnancy weight (6 down, 6 to go), or whether my breasts are becoming engorged much less often now, but it's probably some combination of the two.
</p>
<p>
<b>Austen got weighed at the doctor this morning</b>, and he was a little lighter than I thought he'd be: 18 lbs., 9 oz. That means he gained a little less than 2 lbs. in the past month, as compared to the 3+ he gained in each of the previous months. I'm glad the torrid pace of growth is finally slowing a bit.
</p>
<p>
<b>The nursing station</b>, which I'd planned to write about back in January but never did, <b>has been dismantled</b>. It was the perfect setup for the first few months: a comfy chair set next to a wheeled cart that held snacks, pens, paper, coussinets, water, Kleenex, and (of course) computers. I now have my old desk set up in the gallery (the small space at the top of the stairs, outside Austen's room), and I nurse Austen in whatever chair/couch/bed happens to be nearby when he's hungry. I don't even use the Boppy most of the time. 
</p>
<p>
By the time of its dismantling, the cart had moved to the right side (of the person in the chair) and had gained a monitor stand and two more laptops, but in January, it looked like this:

The car is being repaired, the house is being watched, and we have made it through airport security (no mean feat with an infant, a stroller, two carry-ons, and two laptops). All that remains is to get on the plane.
</p>

<P>
Austen is being even more talkative than he was yesterday, which was a new high water mark. I can't tell whether everyone's staring at us because they're trying to gauge how awful it would be to sit next to us, or because they find my purple hair intriguing. Probably both.

<h3 class="title">Time Zone Trauma</h3>

<p>
We were hoping that somehow flying six hours across three time zones wouldn't affect Austen's body clock, but of course that was a totally ridiculous notion. The poor boopster is still sleeping at the moment, probably convinced that it's the middle of the night. He woke up at 3:30am screaming; Al hypothesized that he was just waking up at his normal 6:30am ET, but as the person he was sleeping closest to (he kept pursuing the boobs with such zeal, even in his sleep, that he had me hanging off the side of the King-sized bed), I can confirm that his nasal passages clogged to the point where he couldn't breathe. The scream was a scream of panic.
</p>

<p>
We've been humidifying his room at home for the past couple nights because he caught the respiratory infection I had, and the doctor said a moist room would help him breathe. I think between the airplane and the extra-dry hotel room, the snot in his nose solidified and his delicate nasal passages swelled to the point where  it was like trying to breathe through a coffee stirrer. I got him up, steamed up the bathroom, and sat in there for a while with him, which seemed to help. I'll be buying a small humidifier for him today.
</p>

<p>
Oh, he just woke up. Good morning, sunshine!
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="awake_040705.jpg" src="/blog/images/awake_040705.jpg" width="450" height="300" galleryimg="no" />
</p>

<p>
Austen's also probably all out of whack because of the extra stimulation he got yesterday. Between smiling at everyone in the airport and on the plane and playing with half my former colleages at Macromedia (the other half were working at home yesterday), he was pretty exhausted by the time we went out for dinner at around 6. (A big hooray again for <a href="http://www.taylorsrefresher.com/menus_fb.htm" target="a8_win">Taylor's Automatic</a>.)
</p>

<p>
OK, the kid is now well and truly awake, so I'd better get on with the diaper changing. We're going over to Oakland today to see Morrisa and Miranda&#8212;yay!

<h3 class="title">Morrisa, Miranda, nj, and Austen</h3>

<p>
Had a lovely time visiting with Morrisa and Miranda (and nj, who was there for a few minutes before he had to leave for work) yesterday. It's so interesting for me to catch up and compare notes with my friends who've become parents in the past year or two (and there are so many of us!). I was so shocked to see Miranda walking and talking! Last I saw her she was only a little older than Austen is now. It's hard to believe that Austen will be at that stage someday... I try not to think about it too much, though, since living in the now helps keep me from being completely overwhelmed with parenthood.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Today I'm meeting Jean and Ellen for coffee/breakfast, and then I'll hop over to Macromedia for lunch with Winsha. Unfortunately, it's raining&#8212;AND I FORGOT THE RAIN COVER FOR THE STROLLER. I'm such a freaking idiot! I had had every intention of bringing it... I guess I just forgot to think about where I'd put it, and so I didn't put it anywhere. Fart! After running a couple errands in the immediate vicinity of the hotel while wearing the Baby Bjorn yesterday afternoon, I can say definitively that the Bjorn would not be a good substitute for the stroller on outings lasting more than an hour (especialy when I'm also carrying packages).
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping that the rain is more like a drizzle, and that the combination of the sunshade and the canopy will provide sufficient protection for Austen. Unfortunately, I'm also down a blanket, since he kicked off the one we brought, and it ended up going under the wheels of the stroller (and my feet) on Market Street. Ew. While we weren't in the urine-soaked stretch of Market between 5th and 9th, I'm still unwilling to put the blanket back on the baby until it's washed. I guess I will hunt around the hotel room and see if there's a suitable substitute, like a towel or something.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Dodging Downpours</h3>

<p>
Yesterday was a weird day weatherwise: It alternated between partly sunny and incredibly rainy. The valets/bellstaff at our hotel ushered me down to the garage to get into the car in the morning so I wouldn't have to load the baby and the stroller in a downpour (so nice!), so the only time I got wet was when I had to get Austen out of the car at Sally's. The rest of the day I managed to be outside only when it was sunny/cloudy, and not when the sky opened up.
</p>
<p>
Sally's was where I met Jean and Ellen for coffee, baked goods, and baby interaction. It was so neat to see Ellen in person at 7 months; we'd last seen her when she was only two weeks old, and I was at 7 months. :) I got advice from Jean about how to find a nanny to help me out one to two days a week (I think I'm going to continue contracting for a while, and the current system of Al working during the day while I watch Austen, and me working at night while Al watches Austen isn't sustainable), and we compared notes on everything from sleeping to soothing to installing car seats. We also did a lot of playing with the babies.
</p>

</p>
<p>
When Jean had to leave, I moved the car over to De Haro Street and then walked over to Macromedia to say hi to some friends and meet Winsha for lunch. On the way, Heather called, and we made plans for lunch on Monday. I love that we're here for a whole week! Incidentally, people keep asking why I'm here, and when I explain that Al came out for Flash Forward, meetings, and college recruiting, they seem surprised that I came along, too. One person even said, &quot;well, at least you know people here, so you're not stuck in the hotel room the whole time.&quot; People, I wouldn't be stuck in the hotel room even if I didn't know a soul. If I don't stay in the house when I'm at home in Philadelphia, why would I do that here? I am someone who would explore any city I happened to be in, kid in tow. And as for tagging along with my husband, all it costs us is airfare and whatever I spend on food&#8212;and it doesn't cost his company anything extra, since they'd be putting him up in a hotel room whether I came or not. Let's see: Traveling with my husband to an interesting city vs. staying home alone with the baby for 8 days. Which would you choose? Throw in a ton of friends and former colleagues to visit, and if the choice wasn't obvious before, it should be now.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, there was a massive downpour while I was in the Macromedia building, but it stopped by the time Winsha and I went out the front door. We had lunch at Pazzo (tuna and avocado sandwiches for both of us) and caught up on work, commutes, and life in general while Austen kicked off his new socks, grabbed my napkin, fussed outrageously, and had his first taste of something other than breastmilk and Infant Tylenol: a bit of avocado smeared on my finger. (Seems fitting, no? :) We've never been able to get a good photo of Sad Face at home, but I managed to get one version of it here&#8212;I just missed the lower lip jutting out first. Austen's mood is no reflection on Winsha, whose cheerfulness and whimsy rank among the top things I miss about living here. I think Austen had just had enough of interacting with new people&#8212;and not quite enough sleep. 
</p>

</p>

<p>
After lunch (which was fairly late), I drove over to the Herbst Theater to pick Al up from Flash Forward, and we had a little family time in the evening. We took a walk over to the Jamba Juice at the Macy's Cellar and to Starbucks for a Chantico, picked up water and wipes and a copy of Sideways on DVD, and then came back to the hotel. Al ordered room service, and I walked over to the Metreon with Austen in the Bjorn to get something for myself. (Our only complaints about <a href="http://www.hotelpalomar.com/" target="a8_win">this hotel</a> are that the toilet seat is pretty cheap and ill-fitting, and that the room service menu is fairly limited and not particularly vegetarian-friendly. Otherwise, everything from the room to the bell staff has been fabulous.) I got some incredibly yummy (but at $9.49, outrageously expensive) udon with shrimp and tofu from the Long Life Noodle place.  If price is no object, I'd recommend it.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/blog/images/al_jamba_040805.jpg" width="267" height="400" />
</p><p>
We watched most of Sideways on my laptop before finally following Austen's lead and conking out. We finished it off this morning, and are now planning to head over to the Embarcadero for a walk before driving down to Los Altos Hills to visit friends for dinner. I leave you with this morning's cute-baby-in-bed photo:

<h3 class="title">Exersaucer!</h3>

<p>
As I mentioned at the end of yesterday morning's post, we headed down to the Embarcadero to see the farmer's market at the Ferry Building and to have some more sweet potato fries at Taylor's. Austen was great through lunch, but afterwards he got grumpy, and his mood rubbed off on me. (Add to that the fact that I had to pee, and the lines were so long at the Ferry Building bathrooms that it wasn't practical to wait with a baby for the handicap stall to open up.) We bought a bottle of wine to bring to dinner at Craig &amp; Nico's and some oranges at an organic farm stand, and then we headed back to the hotel (well, after a stop at See's).
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/blog/images/at_taylors.jpg" alt="with Mommy at Taylor's" width="240" height="360" />&nbsp;<img src="/blog/images/with_al.jpg" alt="with Al at Taylor's" width="240" height="360" /><br />

<img src="/blog/images/pushing_stroller.jpg" alt="me pushing the Zooper" width="240" height="360" />
</p>
<p>
We were all a bit tired&#8212;Austen is sleeping in the bed with us, which means he wants to nurse every couple hours through the night&#8212;so we just rested for a while before driving down to Los Altos Hills.   
I think Al got actively sad as we drove down 280; the views were so spectacular that he couldn't quite believe we left them. This reminded us, too, that we'd picked up copies of the Real Estate Times to look through while eating at Taylor's, but we were so busy holding Austen while stuffing down fries that we never got a chance to open them.
</p>
<p>
When we arrived at Craig and Nico's, we found that Nico had gotten out some toys for Austen that her sons had liked but had mostly outgrown: a little tent to lie under, some colorful stuffed whoozits, and an exersaucer. Why it had never occurred to us that Austen might like an exersaucer&#8212;and that if he did, it could replace the swing and bouncy seat that Austen's now too big for&#8212;when his favorite thing is to stand up, I couldn't tell you. It seemed like the most obvious thing in the world as soon as we put him in it.

Al and I looked at each other and declared, &quot;WE ARE SO GETTING ONE OF THESE.&quot; Nico advised us to borrow one, if possible, since it's only useful for a few months and then must be stored or given away (and the thing is huge), but we'll probably end up buying one and then passing it on to our friends who are now pregnant.
</p>
<p>
We had a lovely dinner with Craig, Nico, Stosh, and Rey, and then all the kids seemed to get cranky at once, so we went our separate ways to soothe. Austen fell asleep in the car on the way back, and a walk to the Starbucks at the Metreon in the Bjorn cemented the deal. Al and I were able to stay up for a little while reading the Real Estate Times and uploading images to the baby blog for the grandparents to see. As for the former, it seems that every time we visit we discover that housing prices have gone up AGAIN. We are starting to despair that we'll ever be afford to move back!
</p>

<p>
Today I'm planning to hang out with Kristin while Al hits golf balls. I'm looking forward to heading west in the city and revisiting some old haunts!

<h3 class="title">Sunshine (and Overstimulation) in San Francisco</h3>

<p>
Had a lovely day walking around San Francisco, eating incredibly yummy chocolate pudding from Cafe Tartine, soaking up the sun in Dolores Park, drinking cappucino at Squat 'N Gobble, and just generally enjoying spending time with Kristin yesterday. I had less fun trying to get Austen to nurse properly at practically every place we stopped, but I got him fed and calm eventually. Everyone (including us) thought the long plane ride would be the hard part about traveling, but overstimulation has been a much bigger problem.
</p>

<p>
We have loved introducing Austen to all our friends and taking him to our favorite Bay Area places, but we've learned that the little guy has limits: He can really only smile at so many new people each day before he melts down. By about 4pm yesterday Austen was done for the day, but we still had things to do and people to see. We drove to the Outer Richmond to see Beth &amp; Matt (who served us wine and cheese in their lovely back yard), and then met up with Kristin again for dim sum at Ton Kiang. That's where the meltdown happened, unfortunately; the food was great and so was the company, but I felt bad for possibly ruining other diners' dinners when Austen started wailing. I know I would have hated it in my former childless life.
</p>
<p>
Today we're trying to spread out the activities and introductions a bit. After a quiet morning I had a really nice lunch with Heather and Derek down near the ballpark (it was my first time meeting Derek in person&#8212;such a great guy!); to my relief Austen was calm and smiley and sweet the entire time. I was glad to see that he could recover well from the trauma at Ton Kiang. Derek was more of a natural with a baby on his lap than he realized, and Heather impressed Austen with her knowledge of cartoon theme songs (I've now got the Banana Splits theme stuck in my head, too).

</p>
<p>
While I was lunching with people from my early Internet days, so was Al: He and his friend Morgen, with whom he worked at @Home (and later at OSAF), were taking on tapas at the Thirsty Bear. I stopped by the restaurant so Morgen could see Austen, and then we went back to the hotel so Al could work and Austen and I could rest.

I know we're pushing it going down to Palo Alto to have dinner with our friend Ken, but hopefully Austen won't go ballistic until the car ride home...

<h3 class="title">Reel Moms and Real Work</h3>

<p>
 The Loews Theater inside the Metreon, which is a block away from our hotel, is a Reel Moms venue, and since today is Tuesday, I decided to go to the movies. The film was actually one I was curious to see&#8212;Fever Pitch&#8212;since I saw the original British version recently, and I like Nick Hornby's novels. The original was really only a 2-star movie, but I figured that left room for improvement, and making it about the Boston Red Sox seemed like a smart move. 
</p>
<p>
 Oh, how I wish there were anything else smart about this movie.
 I'm not sure I can adequately describe how awful it was, but here are just a few of my complaints:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it really that hard to find someone with a Boston accent for a movie about the Red Sox? They explained Jimmy Fallon's lack of accent by making him a New Jersey transplant, but they failed to explain why everyone else sounded like they were from California or New York.</li>
<li> All the lines (yes, ALL of them&#8212;at least, all the ones in the first half, which is all I stayed for) sounded like they were one-off statements rather than components of dialogue. The characters weren't talking to each other; they were just talking. Stiffly.</li>
<li>There were several moments of what was supposed to be high hilarity, but since these were as ill-integrated as the &quot;dialogue&quot;, they just made me wonder whether the people behind this dreck thought they were making a romantic comedy or a Leslie Neilsen vehicle. Also, note to writers: People getting hit in the head, dropped from a great height, and punched in the face? Not funny.</li>
<li>The product placements (HELLO, MARQUIS JET!) were even more ham-handed and incongruous than either the dialogue or the  moments of &quot;comedy&quot;, which is saying a lot. What exactly does Marquis Jet's promising business outlook have to do with loving math and numbers in general? The company's mission statement is articulated more clearly than how Drew Barrymore's character is putting her math degree to practical use (the demonstration of which is supposedly the point of that scene). </li>
<li>I've seen Drew Barrymore perform admirably in a well-written film, but I've never thought she was that great an actress&#8212;and she certainly can't make a bad movie bearable. Quite the opposite, in fact.   </li>
<li>Can there really be someone in Boston who doesn't know who Carl   Yastrzemski   is? Especially someone over the age of 25?</li>
<li>Drew Barrymore's friends in this movie are positively TOXIC. It's hard to believe anyone could think that women are this mean, spiteful, stupid, and obsessed with &quot;tagging and bagging&quot; men... except perhaps <a href="http://mightygirl.net/2005_04_01_archive.html#111238946960510505" target="a8_win">this guy</a> or <a href="http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/03_08_2005.html" target="a8_win">this guy</a>. I'm seriously starting to worry that it's becoming socially acceptable to trash women (again).</li>
</ol>
<p>
I could go on, but as I noted in #2, Austen and I gave up and left about halfway through. He was hating the movie as much as I was. The only interesting part was comparing this venue to our home theater in Cherry Hill. Apparently the Metreon doesn't enforce the &quot;under 1 year&quot; guideline, as there were several children in the 1-3 range running around the theater. When I asked one of the other moms where the changing table was, she seemed surprised; her friend said, &quot;we should ask them to put one in!&quot; I thought they were standard at Reel Moms gigs, but I guess not. One thing that was the same, much to my dismay: They forgot (or never had any intention) to turn down the sound. Note to Loews: Lower the fucking volume, already! The mooing of the cows in the THX intro nearly blew out <em>my</em> eardrums, and Austen positively writhed in agony. 
</p>
<p>
We emerged from the theater to find like eight Bugaboo Frog strollers parked outside, and when we hit the streets, we passed two more. Al and I have been looking for signs that the Bay Area economy is picking up; there've been several, but this glut of $700+ strollers may be the best sign yet.
</p>
<p>
After a couple stops to pick up presents for friends here, I went into the office to meet with my manager (the person whose budget my checks come out of? the person who tells me what to work on? as an independent contractor whose  full-time job is raising a kid, I don't really think in terms of managers anymore...). He wants to extend my contract through August, and I'm interested in doing the work he described, so Al and I have agreed that we will try to find a nanny who can come to our house a couple days a week (I agreed to  15 hours, which translates to about two full workdays). This is a big step for me, hiring a nanny; luckily we discussed the possibility a couple weeks ago (I vetoed it vehemently then), so I've had a chance to roll the idea around in my brain for a while. I'll probably have more to say on this topic when I'm less tired and have had a chance to comb craigslist looking for prospects. For now, I leave you with the cute baby photo of the day, and the news that Austen rolled from his tummy to his back for the first time (and then several more times, once he realized he could do it) this morning.

<h3 class="title">We're Back</h3>

<p>
After spending a week in San Francisco with friends I dearly miss (many of whom also now have babies Austen's age), I've been having fantasies about moving back there. Upon landing at PHL, however, I learned that Philadelphia had a plan to win me  over with the same weather we had in SF (upper 50s and low 60s, bright sunshine, low humidity), lower gas and food prices, and a house we love. Of course, then I did our taxes and discovered that in addition to paying local wage taxes, we were also on the hook for over a thousand dollars in Philadelphia school taxes&#8212;and the schools here aren't even that good. Harrumph. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, we were so busy cramming last-minute visits and activities into our San Francisco schedule (and the line for the computers at Tressider on the Stanford campus was long on Wednesday), I haven't had a chance to write about what we did on our last day.
</p>
<p>
Al was scheduled to work a booth at a job fair at Stanford, so we went a little early and had coffee with <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2004/07/photographic_ev.html#pruittslab">Beth</a>, who's a professor there. She and Matt got a dog since we last saw them, and every day Moxie makes the commute from San Francisco to Palo Alto with Beth. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/blog/images/wed_stanford/beth_moxie_0413.jpg" alt="Beth and Moxie outside Tressider studen center" width="360" height="240">
&nbsp;	
<img src="/blog/images/wed_stanford/us_babies_0413.jpg" alt="us and our babies" width="360" height="240">
</p>
<p>
After coffee Al went up to the job fair, and I went to Stanford Shopping Center to buy Austen some more cute Gymboree clothes (thanks to Al's parents for financing the baby-clothes shopping spree). I found a great hat and onesie from the same robot line as the <a href="/blog/images/bleep_bleep.html" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('/blog/images/bleep_bleep.html','sf0405v','menubar=yes,width=240,height=360');return false;">bleep bleep</a> shirt&#8212;on sale!&#8212;and also got him another cute golf onesie. When I got bored at the mall I went back to the Stanford campus and noodled around until Al was finished at the job fair.
</p>
<p>
From Palo Alto we drove down to Los Altos, where we met John and Kathy for dinner at the Los Altos Grill (formerly Bandera). Kathy is pregnant with their first child, and it was exciting to swap pregnancy stories and show them what'll be coming their way soon. :) What I didn't intend to show them was my complete ineptitude when it comes to changing a diaper in public. I left the wipes in the car and didn't notice until I had Austen on the changing table and undressed; luckily, I hadn't removed the poopy diaper yet (mainly because I normally get the wipes out first before removing the diaper). I had to come back out of the handicap stall (one of only two) so I could let the next person in line pee and so I could call Al at the table and ask him to go get the wipes. Of course, I had the keys to the car, so Kathy had to come get them while I held a squirming, half-naked Austen. Al returned with the wipes a few minutes later, I waited in line again for the handicap stall, and despite the fact that I blocked the lovely spot lighting in the stall every time I leaned over to wipe Austen, managed to get all the poop out of his folds (I think).
</p>
<p>
Anyway, after the diaper incident, dinner progressed normally. I had a wonderfully tasty vegetable plate, the corn bread was delicious, and the conversations about Project Greelight and parenting were stimulating as ever, if too short. Wish we had more time to visit.

<h3 class="title">Leaky II</h3>

<p>
My friend Shannon and her baby, Madison, came over for a visit yesterday. It was a lovely day to be outside, so after chatting a bit and feeding up the kids, we grabbed some cool and refreshing chow at the Pad Thai Shack and headed to Rittenhouse Square.
</p>
<p>
It was great to catch up on all the goings on in our respective households; since Madison is exactly 6 weeks younger than Austen, Shannon and I do a lot of note-comparing on all kinds of baby subjects. One thing she asked me was whether I still needed the coussinets, or whether the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/01/leaky.html#000268">leakage</a> had stopped. I replied that it's mostly stopped, but since I still dribble a bit occasionally, I thought I'd just use up my remaining supply (I bought a new box of 60 when we got to San Francisco).
</p>
<p>
Apparently this comment angered the breast milk gods, because when I went to get Austen out of his crib this morning at 7am, I found that my nursing bra was wet on the right side (the one that's usually *less* leaky!). The coussinet inside was completely saturated&#8212;heavier than a full pee diaper, if you know what that feels like. Good thing I've still got 30+ coussinets left...
</p>
<p>
Speaking of leakage, here's a new example of Murphy's Law: We've noticed that every time we give Austen a bath, his diaper leaks the next morning. Why is that?
</p>
<p>
In other baby news, it seems my instinct to look for new earrings today was right on the money (I was trying to find some simple but pretty studs): While playing with Austen after shopping, he grabbed my face, turned my head so he could get a better look at my right earlobe, and then reached for the little ring in the bottom hole. Luckily I figured out what he was up to before he made the grab, so I was ready to catch his hand in mine to keep him from pulling once he caught hold of the earring. It's really amazing to me how good his grabbing skills have gotten over the past three weeks or so.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned that we'd planned to buy Austen an exersaucer when we returned from SF; we did indeed do that on Saturday. We couldn't find the exact one that Craig &amp; Nico had (apparently baby toys rev even more frequently than software), but we picked out a model that had a gadget similar to the one Austen was so enamored with on it. I actually thought the model we picked had too many gadgets, but I figured we could just not install all of them. As it happened, Austen got the hang of turning in the little seat pretty quickly and expected to see some new toy with every quarter turn, so I kept adding toys until they were all on there. It looks overwhelming when he's not in it, but he seems to love it, so I can't complain. About half the toys were installed when I took this photo:

<p>
Interestingly, his favorite items seem to be the orange jester thing on the right, the frog (which tends to bop him in the head a lot, as if reminding him to stuff it into his mouth), and the king and queen (which I think are supposed to make sounds, but don't&#8212;to my immense relief). He hardly plays with the bead-filled cylinder that was our reason for picking this model at all. (Actually, I'd pick the orange jester over the bead cylinder, too.)

</p>
<p>
More later, when I'm not so tired (and when I don't have a million other things to do with my limited free time... oh, wait, that might be never. &lt;sigh&gt;).

<p>I'm risking carsickness by blogging, but ever since I discovered I could blog from the labor and delivery floor on Nov. 30th, I can't resist the temptation to do it whenever Al hands me his Blackberry.</p>

<p>We're on our way to NYC to celebrate Al's dad's 70th birthday, and we'll stay overnight at Al's brother's place. Technically this will be the second time Austen has met his cousin Henry, but it'll be the first time he'll get to interact with him because Henry was recovering from a cold at Christmas, and Austen was really too little to know what was going on.</p>

<p>When we get back from NYC, a new person will enter Austen's life (and mine): I found someone to babysit for him two days a week while I work. I'm still a little nervous about it, even though I'll be in the house the whole time, I'll be handling feedings, and the person I hired has agreed to take it one day at a time. </p>

<p>I'm excited about getting some work done, and about Austen spending time with someone who knows a bit about child development (and who speaks fluent German!), so I hope it works out.</p>

<p>
Thanks to our new babysitter, I was able to spend time with Austen yesterday *and* get a full day's work in. It felt like a revelation. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">

</p>

<p>
Today <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ratphooey/">ratphooey</a> and Alexander came over, so I got an extra dose of cute baby, some stimulating conversation, and an excuse to buy (and consume) yummy baked goods.
</p>

<img alt="babies427.jpg" src="/blog/images/babies427.jpg" width="360" height="240" galleryimg="no" />
</p>

<p>
And although last night was a rough one, Austen and I got to sleep in this morning&#8212;which meant I had the energy to cook a delicious dinner of pan-fried salmon, wilted spinach, and miniature butternut squash ravioli, share it with my wonderful husband, and then go for a pre-bedtime family walk.
</p>

<p>
I'm so lucky.
