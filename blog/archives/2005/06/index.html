<h3 class="title">Back From the Great White North</h3>

<p>
We're back from Vancouver, and I'm still in the process of entering some of my hand-written notes about the games into <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">The Ice Hockey Escapades</a>, as well as adding photos to the entries I was able to post from Al's Blackberry. 
I moved to paper after a couple games for two reasons: (1) my hands were already sore from holding my stick, and typing with my thumbs made the pain worse; and (2) it was faster to just take notes on paper, leaving more time for hanging out with my husband and child between games.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">

me posting from Al's Blackberry with Austen by my side
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure what I was thinking when I booked this trip; was it that we didn't end up wanting/needing the extra day in Vancouver last time we went? Or was it that Al wouldn't want to take an extra day off from work? I can't remember, but for whatever reason, I had us coming in a few hours before the game on Friday, and leaving early Monday morning. I obviously didn't take into account that we'd be flying in from farther away this time and that the airfare would be more expensive, or I would have tried to make more of a vacation out of it. In any case, we did end up having a lovely mini-vacation. The weather was fantastic, all of us really enjoyed the hotel (as always), Al got his favorite MMMuffins at the Brentwood Mall, and I got my favorite snacks at the Canadian superstore across from the hotel. And of course, I got to play a lot of hockey. (What I didn't do was take a lot of photos, sadly; that's what the extra day would have been good for.)
</p>
<p>
We'd planned to offer Austen a solid food of some kind while in Canada, but it turned out to be difficult to find/prepare a single-ingredient food for him while on the road (you're supposed to introduce one food at a time to check for allergic reactions). We did give him a bit of Al's McDonalds ice cream cone during the three-and-a-half-hour layover at Chicago O'Hare, but I don't think the mono- and diglycerides agreed with him, because he threw it up not long after.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/blog/images/vancouver_05.05/cone.jpg" alt="Austen eating ice cream" width="240" height="160" />
</p><p>
Remember how I was thinking I'd like for Austen to try a uniquely Canadian food? Michele suggested poutine (also mentioned on <a href="http://londonsoft.typepad.com/travelinglondons/2004/08/valemount_to_ja.html" target="a8_win">Jay and Donna's blog</a>), but as that's definitely a multi-ingredient dish, Al ordered it for himself instead, and Austen stuck with his old standby, paper. He ate napkins, chopstick wrappers, and even the address tag on my hockey stick bag (and he seemed to enjoy them more than the spoonful of avocado I gave him this afternoon). He also tried to munch on the carseat straps, but we actively discouraged this as the (rented) carseat was kind of gross. (On the plus side, according to Al, it was easier to install than our Graco Comfortsport.)
</p>

</p>
<p>
We noticed that flying with Austen was slightly more difficult this time than when we went to San Francisco in April, mainly because he's bigger and stronger now than he was then. He was still very well behaved, but his habit of stretching out while nursing meant that his head and feet were always hanging over the armrests. This was awkward when I was on the aisle, and downright painful for me on the one leg where I sat in the middle. (All our flights were completely, totally full.) His increased strength meant that our arms really got a workout when he was awake and wanting to stand on our laps (which is why I had Al hold him more on the return flights&#8212;my arms were already sore from four hockey games in a row). I think next time we fly I'll seriously consider buying him a seat and trying to distract him with toys.
</p>
<p>
Also unlike our SF trip, which involved no in-flight poopy diapers, Austen pooped twice on the flight from PHL to ORD, and once on the flight from ORD to YVR. Poops #2 and #3 came close enough to the end of each flight that we were able to change him in the airport bathrooms. Poop #1 required a change on the floor next to one of the plane's emergency exits, since there was no changing table in the lavatory. (All of the planes we were on were older, and it's only the newer ones that have changing tables&#8212;and faucets that stay on for a few seconds so you can wash your one free hand.) Incidentally, he also pooped on the return flight from ORD to PHL&#8212;about 30 seconds after the fasten seatbelt sign went on prior to pushback. Lucky for the friendly twentysomething guy sitting on the aisle that we didn't succeed in starting solids for real this weekend, as breastmilk-only poop doesn't smell too bad. (Although the paper Austen's been eating *is* showing up in his poop, it doesn't seem to have affected the smell much.) That poop also required a change on the floor.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, we all made it back safely (although my hockey bag didn't arrive until this morning, and the idiots who screened it apparently left one of the zippered pockes open, allowing a few small items&#8212;though no equipment, thank god&#8212;to fall out), the Canadian immigration agent was kind enough to stamp Austen's passport so he has a souvenir of his first trip out of the country, and I'm primed for the summer hockey season, which starts in less than two weeks. Yay!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Anakin and Austen</h3>

<p>
Al and I went to see the last Star Wars movie tonight. I'll spare you my review (I enjoyed parts of the movie very much, others <em>not</em> so much, but as it's been analyzed to death in newspapers, magazines, and the blogosphere by now, I'm sure I'd be adding nothing new) and instead say a few words about what it was like to see it with Austen.
</p>

<p>
Overall he was very well behaved, and, except for the time he poked me in the eye, the time he bit me while nursing, and the time threw up on me, pretty good company. He watched the first 15 minutes or so quietly and without protesting the fact that I had my hands clamped firmly over his ears. (We found the sound level to be a little quieter in the back of the theater, where we'd moved after a few deafening previews, but I was still concerned that it was too loud for a 6-month old.) I then felt his body start to relax and asked Al to check his eyelids; Al indicated that they were wide open, and that he was watching intently. I had Al check two more times in the next 10 minutes, and the third time, he was definitely asleep.
</p>

<p>
I think he slept for about 15-20 minutes on my shoulder, and when he woke up, I nursed him on the right side. He was almost completely asleep&#8212;and I'd let the jacket I'd been pressing against his exposed ear slip&#8212;when Chancellor Palpatine let out a howl and attacked Mace Windu &amp; Co. Austen started to howl right along with the Chancellor, and it took a minute or two to convince him that he was OK, that nobody was coming to attack him with lightsabers.
</p>

<p>
Once we got him chilled out again, he knelt on my lap for a while with his body toward me and his face toward the screen; it was very important, apparently, that he not miss anything. I then had Al hold him for a bit so he'd remember seeing Star Wars with his dad. When he fussed a little, Al handed him back, and I nursed him on the left until he bit me. At that point I tipped him up, and he watched a little more of the movie facing forward, barely glancing away as he threw up on me. I'm not sure what we missed in the frantic attempt to fish some kind of tissue, napkin, or towel out of the diaper bag; probably not much.
</p>

<p>
About the time that I started getting into the movie (I couldn't have cared less for most of it, but the last half hour sort of summed up all the backstory I'd heard about Star Wars between 1977 and 1999), Austen lost interest in it, and instead decided to focus on my face. He laughed, giggled, squealed, grabbed my nose, and poked me in the eye (hard enough to make my left eye water for several minutes, and it still hurts). I wished I'd put my glasses back on when Austen first removed them instead of handing them to Al, but I figured they had so many fingerprints on them that I wouldn't be able to see anyway.
</p>

<p>
We've been playing a game lately where whenever Austen shouts/growls/groans/auoogahs, I shout/growl/groan/auoogah back in exactly the same fashion, and at this point I think he decided that he would play it with the sound-effects-laden movie. At first he responded to the screen, and then, as I do with him sometimes, he anticipated the groans, shouts, and other sounds and managed to make the same ones in unison with it. Sometimes he also inserted his own sound effects, which is what eventually led me to take him down near the exit, so I could dash out if necessary. I didn't, because I wanted to see what was going on; Al said he could still hear Austen auoogahing (not surprising, since the theater was stadium style, and we were directly below where Al was sitting), and that his timing was sometimes hilariously spot-on.
</p>

<p>
We left the theater with Austen laughing, and he laughed and played in his carseat all the way home. There was only a little protest when Al put him to bed (Al ended up giving him a little speech about how all the images he saw tonight were just pretend, and that he shouldn't worry about them in his dreams), and he's been fast asleep since. All in all, a successful Star Wars outing.*
</p>

<p style="font-size:smaller">
*Unless, of course, he wakes up at 2am screaming about the dark side, battle droids, or lava creeping up his legs.

<h3 class="title">Breastfeeding in Public</h3>

<p>
A friend sent me a link to a New York Times article called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/07/nyregion/07nurse.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5070&en=214308d2a3d41216&ex=1118808000&emc=eta1" target="a8_win">'Lactivists' Taking Their Cause, and Their Babies, to the Streets</a> (free subscription required to view), and it made me realize how lucky I am&#8212;and how nonchalant I've become&#8212;when it comes to breastfeeding in public.
</p>

<p>
The list of places I've fed Austen is probably shorter than the list of places I haven't, with the former including at least four different airports; several restaurants; random benches at the mall and the park; my local CVS pharmacy; the car; the ice rink; and the lovely 2nd floor bathroom at Nordstrom King of Prussia. Just yesterday I fed him at the Starbucks at 16th and Market while drinking a cappucino and eating an iced lemon pound cake, with no complaints.
</p>

<p>
In the first weeks of Austen's life the UPS man saw me nursing him on an almost daily basis; a spate of new baby and Christmas gift deliveries combined with Austen's every 90 minutes eating schedule meant that I was always answering the door with a baby on the boob. His response was exactly what you'd hope for as a nursing mom: he'd sign for me, put the package inside, and never, ever stare. I love my UPS guy for that.
</p>

<p>
I'm aware of how uncomfortable witnessing a breastfeeding mother makes some people. I was uncomfortable myself when my sister-in-law fed my 18 month-old nephew at the dinner table in Hawaii once, in fact. I tried to analyze what about the situation made me uncomfortable, and I realized that it was the fact that he was playing more than eating, leaving the giant nipple exposed and pointing at me most of the time. I couldn't understand, at the time, how my sister-in-law could continue talking to the rest of us as if her boob wasn't hanging out for everyone to see. (I can now, of course; when you're feeding an infant every 2 hours, you get used to going about your business while doing it, and you sometimes forget that you're half-naked. :)
</p>

<p>
To lessen the chance that I'll make others feel the way I did in Hawaii, I close up the shop if Austen shows more interest in looking around than in eating, even if he fusses. I never leave the boob exposed if I can help it (when the kid pops off, the shirt comes down). If I have a choice between a table in the corner and one in front of the door, I'll take the corner. But I also don't make a bigger deal out of covering myself up or hiding from view than I need to. I don't want to invite stares, but I also don't want to suggest that I'm doing anything odd or dirty. I figure the more women who breastfeed in public without making people think, "good lord, put that thing away!", the more comfortable everyone will be with it in the long run. 
</p>

<p>
So thanks to my so-far positive public breastfeeding experiences, I won't be taking to the streets in protest. I'll just continue doing what I'm doing and try to return the consideration folks are showing me. But for Barbara Walters, and the guy complaining loudly on his cell phone about the breastfeeding mom across the aisle, I have a message: Yeah, I know, our exposed breasts are uncomfortably close to you, thanks to sardine-style airplane seating. But which would you rather have: An infant eating quietly on the ascent and descent, or one screaming his lungs out because his ears won't pop? I'd take the exposed breast and the quiet baby any day... but then, I'd also take the screaming baby over you and your shouted cell phone conversation, too, asshole.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Oh, The Old Minolta</h3>

<p>
A few weeks ago I was down in the basement doing some laundry, and I set Austen on the couch for a few minutes so I could unload the dryer. He looked so cute sitting there that I wanted to get a photo... but I hadn't brought the 10-D downstairs with me. That's when I remembered that I have two or three film cameras, and that they're all in the basement.
</p>

<p>
I pulled out my favorite, my dad's old Minolta x700, and saw that there was indeed a roll of film already in it. (I wasn't sure what kind, since it doesn't have a little window that shows the film canister, and I never put the tab from the film box in the slot designed for that purpose on the back of the camera body.) I finished the roll (which turned out to be Kodak 400CN) and then mailed it to <a href="http://www.photoworkssf.com/" target="a8_win">one of the shops I used to take film to in the Bay Area</a> for processing.
</p>

<p>
When I got the prints and photo CD I'd asked for back in the mail, I discovered that what was on the roll already were snaps I'd taken almost two years to the day prior to the Austen photos. My favorite is <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town/archives/2005/06/on_the_beach.shtml">this one of Al</a>. It's from a rainy weekend we spent in Bodega Bay, just getting away and enjoying each other's company. A couple more photos from that beach will be posted at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town/">about town</a> in the next day or two.
</p>

<p>
I didn't think the ones of Austen were particularly impressive; seeing them made me want to try to get something better. Maybe next time we're out and about I'll bring the lovely old Minolta as well as the super modern Canon.

<h3 class="title">Batbaby, Batbaby</h3>

<p>It's another hot day in Philadelphia, and I woke up wondering how Austen and I would spend the 10 hours or so until Al got home without overheating or going bonkers. My usual diversion, a nice long walk with Austen in the stroller, didn't seem prudent in the heat, and I didn't want to spend the whole day trying to work while fighting to keep Austen's little hands away from the trackpad buttons. (He's on my lap at the moment, but he's busy with a frozen washcloth.)</p>

<p>I managed to get us both dressed and fed by 10:30am, so I checked moviefone.com to see if there were any interesting films playing at the Cherry Hill Loews (which, as host of the weekly Reel Moms, is relatively baby-friendly). I noticed that Batman was opening today, and a quick visit to <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_begins/" target_a8_win">rottentomatoes.com</a> told me that the movie was surprisingly fresh. We decided to go.</p>

<p>Long story short, since the wascloth is wearing off: I thought Batman was wonderful. OK, yes, it has a few flaws, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's the movie that all the others should have been, IMHO. Since I'm no fan of superhero movies in general, and I didn't know that the movie was directed by the same guy who did Memento, my expectations were fairly low despite the fresh rating from rottentomatoes, and Batman Begins had no trouble exceeding them.</p>

<p>Austen was pretty well-behaved through the first two thirds of the movie and fast asleep in the Bjorn for the last third (I stood in the entry aisle for that, but I didn't miss anything). And like our Star Wars outing, he emerged from the theater exceedingly happy, and he's been cheerful ever since. I ought to take him to the movies more often!</p>

<h3 class="title">Princeton, Sunday Morning</h3>

<p>
I actually ordered a present for Al for Father's Day (it still hasn't left the warehouse yet, so it'll obviously be late), but his real gift was time: Time to play a round of golf with his brother. They'd planned to meet halfway between their respectives homes, at a course in central New Jersey. I'd planned to stay home and watch the Boopster. 
</p>

<p>
When I found out (last night) that the course was near Princeton, however, I proposed that Austen and I come along. That way we could listen to Harry Potter together in the car (I've been indoctrinating Al, who's finally succumbed to the delights of Jim Dale's voices), and Austen and I could explore the Princeton campus while Al golfed. A Sunday adventure seemed like more fun than staying in the house awaiting Al's return, and I figured I could drive back if Al was tired from golfing.
</p>

<p>
Everything went according to the new, revised plan: We made more progress on Harry Potter than we usually do when we listen on the iPod at night; Al and his brother had a great time golfing; Austen and I toured the Princeton campus and downtown; I got to spend some quality quiet time with my camera; and we all enjoyed a beer (stout for me, IPA for Carl, and root for Al) and some lunch at the Triumph Brewpub in on Nassau Street before heading home. Al even drove both ways and let Austen and me nap in the back seat. Sweet!

<h3 class="title">I Want to Vomit... All Over the Babysitter</h3>

<p>
Well, I'm gratified to know that my instincts are spot-on. What I'm nauseated about is that I don't follow them. I want to get this whole sordid story out of my system, mainly because I think that vomiting it up will make me feel better, but all I can muster right now are a few bullet points:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The babysitter quit last night, via e-mail. Stated reason: The internship she interviewed for on Friday unexpectedly started this week.</li>
<li>I've had concerns for a while about said babysitter's honesty and reliability, but I sat on them because (a) I had a sense that confronting her about lying, even just to say, "you know, I'd rather just have you tell me the truth, even if it's not as pretty" would burst some reality bubble around her and cause a mess, (b) I need a babysitter, and I'm too lazy/face-to-face-meeting-averse to want to look for a new one, and (c) Austen seemed to like her.</li>
<li>Austen is fine. She played nicely with him and never hurt him in any way. I suspect, however, that the child development courses she said she'd taken were as imaginary as the flat tire that made her 15 minutes late one day (a flat tire makes you 30, 45, or 60 minutes late, not 15). </li>
<li>Closing an e-mail with "Respectfully," doesn't make it respectful. Just so you know.</li>
</ul>

<!--
<p>
P.S. I am ...just barely... resisting the urge to publish her full name here so that this tale of irresponsibility would be as likely to come up in a Google search of 'K****** I*******' as her Master's thesis. I've been vindictive before (what do you want? I'm a Scorpio!), however, and I've learned that any gratification is usually drowned out by guilt.

<h3 class="title">Antidote</h3>

<p>
I think it's a little hard to understand while I feel literally, physically sick about the babysitter situation without knowing me&#8212;and, more importantly, without knowing all the details. I just can't bring myself to go through them all here, however; suffice it to say that there's more than irresponsibility involved on the babysitter's part, and a painful history of being made a <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2003/03/april_approache.html">fool</a> of on my part. 
</p>

<p>
The best antidote for the gnawing nausea is my amazing husband, followed closely by the ever-cute Austen. I probably don't mention enough what a truly great person Al is, and how glad I am that I married him. Sometimes I'm just knocked back by what a great match  he is for me. We're so similar it's scary, though he's more patient and kind than I am. Makes me smile just thinking about it.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img alt="sweet_chos.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/sweet_chos.jpg" width="320" height="240" galleryimg="no" />
</p>

<p>
Both Al and Austen, who are never stingy with their love, were also unexpectedly generous with their time yesterday. Al normally watches Austen when I'm at the dentist, but he went above and beyond yesterday afternoon when it took an hour and a half to shave down a tooth in preparation for a crown. Meanwhile, Austen set a new nap record&#8212;<strong>three hours</strong> in the morning, and 45 minutes in the afternoon. I was shocked to find that I could get in a full day's work (though it was accomplished in several shorter bursts rather than in long stretches), a dentist appointment, and a family walk without the aid of a sitter and without going crazy.
</p>

<p>
I should also mention that the rest of my family is also incredibly supportive; both my mom and my sister offered to help watch Austen until I could find another sitter. Mom is willing to come here, and Lisa offered to host me and Austen at her house. I need a fast Internet connection to work, so unfortunately Lisa's house is out, but wasn't it sweet of her to invite us down? I may try to work something out with my mom, though, since I know she'd consider it a treat to spend a week with Austen. :)
</p>

<p>
Today I was supposed to meet with a new babysitting prospect, but she had a family emergency last night and had to go out of town. No worries; it just means I'll have time for lunch with my husband! Yay!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Live 8 In the Hood</h3>

<p>
I had the opportunity last week to join a conference call between the Live 8 organizers and Philadelphia bloggers (of which, apparently, I am one), but I chose not to dial in. My main reason for not participating was that, as someone whose second thought (after "why?"), upon hearing that Live 8 would be taking place in my neighborhood, was "oh my god, we've got to get out of town", I'd feel like a fraud.
</p>

<p>
The other big reason I didn't participate was that, frankly, I'm not sure where I stand on debt relief... or on the idea of a global concert's ability to raise awareness about the subject. I'm not <em>against</em> either of these things&#8212;I just don't feel like I have a firm enough grasp of the issues involved. (And for me, the issues involved are not which bands are playing and whether or not the organizers could have made tons of money for African relief efforts if only they'd sold tickets.) I do have some thoughts swirling around in my head about international aid lending, debt forgiveness, massive government corruption, and the effects of poverty, war, and disease on the African continent, but they don't add up to answers&#8212;only to many, many questions. I'm guessing that I may be one of the very people whose awareness Bob Geldof wants to raise.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I should have gotten on the call, if only to ask whether the goal of the concerts was to educate as well as entertain, and if so, how that would be accomplished&#8212;and what would be the measures of success. I'm also kinda curious about what kind of support they were looking for from the "blogosphere." But that brings me to my third reason for not joining the call: I've learned from experience that it's virtually impossible to listen to, much less participate in, a conference call while holding a(n almost) 7 month-old baby. Sadly, the call time didn't coincide with his nap.
</p>

<p>
I haven't decided whether to watch the Live 8 coverage on television this Saturday, but I definitely won't be seeing any of it in person. We are, indeed, getting out of town. Yeah, I know I might be passing up an opportunity to be a part of a historical moment (or a historical 6 or 9 hours, depending on how you count), but I'm really not a crowd person. I was perfectly happy watching Live Aid from my host family's basement in Sweden instead of experiencing it from underneath the crush of bodies at Wembly or, worse, the skin-frying Philadelphia sun. Back then I knew what I was watching was special, even if I didn't fully understand how it was going to help Africa.
</p>

<p>
Today I understand even less about how a concert will help Africa (and apparently, I'm not alone; millions around the world seem to think Live 8 is about raising money), but I'm hoping it will do something. I'm not so cynical or apathetic that I wouldn't wish the Live 8 organizers well. Here's hoping somebody's listening&#8212;and that they hear more than just screeching guitars and confused concertgoers.
</p>
