<p>
I think it's a little hard to understand while I feel literally, physically sick about the babysitter situation without knowing me&#8212;and, more importantly, without knowing all the details. I just can't bring myself to go through them all here, however; suffice it to say that there's more than irresponsibility involved on the babysitter's part, and a painful history of being made a <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2003/03/april_approache.html">fool</a> of on my part. 
</p>

<p>
The best antidote for the gnawing nausea is my amazing husband, followed closely by the ever-cute Austen. I probably don't mention enough what a truly great person Al is, and how glad I am that I married him. Sometimes I'm just knocked back by what a great match  he is for me. We're so similar it's scary, though he's more patient and kind than I am. Makes me smile just thinking about it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Both Al and Austen, who are never stingy with their love, were also unexpectedly generous with their time yesterday. Al normally watches Austen when I'm at the dentist, but he went above and beyond yesterday afternoon when it took an hour and a half to shave down a tooth in preparation for a crown. Meanwhile, Austen set a new nap record&#8212;<strong>three hours</strong> in the morning, and 45 minutes in the afternoon. I was shocked to find that I could get in a full day's work (though it was accomplished in several shorter bursts rather than in long stretches), a dentist appointment, and a family walk without the aid of a sitter and without going crazy.
</p>

<p>
I should also mention that the rest of my family is also incredibly supportive; both my mom and my sister offered to help watch Austen until I could find another sitter. Mom is willing to come here, and Lisa offered to host me and Austen at her house. I need a fast Internet connection to work, so unfortunately Lisa's house is out, but wasn't it sweet of her to invite us down? I may try to work something out with my mom, though, since I know she'd consider it a treat to spend a week with Austen. :)
</p>

<p>
Today I was supposed to meet with a new babysitting prospect, but she had a family emergency last night and had to go out of town. No worries; it just means I'll have time for lunch with my husband! Yay!

<p>ack! i am using a sitter for the first time tomorrow. the two references i got weren't<br />
glowing, but at the same time, they weren't terrible. i've had such a hard time getting anyone to even show when they said they would, i thought i'd give her a try. i'm only leaving him a couple of hours but it is hard. good luck to you!</p>

<p>I know, finding childcare sucks, doesn't it? I was saying to my friend Shannon yesterday that when you discover your sitter isn't very reliable, what do you do, fire her? Then you're even more f#@&ed!</p>

<p>I hope your new sitter works out!</p>
