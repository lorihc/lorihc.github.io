<h3 class="title">Breastfeeding in Public</h3>

<p>
A friend sent me a link to a New York Times article called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/07/nyregion/07nurse.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5070&en=214308d2a3d41216&ex=1118808000&emc=eta1" target="a8_win">'Lactivists' Taking Their Cause, and Their Babies, to the Streets</a> (free subscription required to view), and it made me realize how lucky I am&#8212;and how nonchalant I've become&#8212;when it comes to breastfeeding in public.
</p>

<p>
The list of places I've fed Austen is probably shorter than the list of places I haven't, with the former including at least four different airports; several restaurants; random benches at the mall and the park; my local CVS pharmacy; the car; the ice rink; and the lovely 2nd floor bathroom at Nordstrom King of Prussia. Just yesterday I fed him at the Starbucks at 16th and Market while drinking a cappucino and eating an iced lemon pound cake, with no complaints.
</p>

<p>
In the first weeks of Austen's life the UPS man saw me nursing him on an almost daily basis; a spate of new baby and Christmas gift deliveries combined with Austen's every 90 minutes eating schedule meant that I was always answering the door with a baby on the boob. His response was exactly what you'd hope for as a nursing mom: he'd sign for me, put the package inside, and never, ever stare. I love my UPS guy for that.
</p>

<p>
I'm aware of how uncomfortable witnessing a breastfeeding mother makes some people. I was uncomfortable myself when my sister-in-law fed my 18 month-old nephew at the dinner table in Hawaii once, in fact. I tried to analyze what about the situation made me uncomfortable, and I realized that it was the fact that he was playing more than eating, leaving the giant nipple exposed and pointing at me most of the time. I couldn't understand, at the time, how my sister-in-law could continue talking to the rest of us as if her boob wasn't hanging out for everyone to see. (I can now, of course; when you're feeding an infant every 2 hours, you get used to going about your business while doing it, and you sometimes forget that you're half-naked. :)
</p>

<p>
To lessen the chance that I'll make others feel the way I did in Hawaii, I close up the shop if Austen shows more interest in looking around than in eating, even if he fusses. I never leave the boob exposed if I can help it (when the kid pops off, the shirt comes down). If I have a choice between a table in the corner and one in front of the door, I'll take the corner. But I also don't make a bigger deal out of covering myself up or hiding from view than I need to. I don't want to invite stares, but I also don't want to suggest that I'm doing anything odd or dirty. I figure the more women who breastfeed in public without making people think, "good lord, put that thing away!", the more comfortable everyone will be with it in the long run. 
</p>

<p>
So thanks to my so-far positive public breastfeeding experiences, I won't be taking to the streets in protest. I'll just continue doing what I'm doing and try to return the consideration folks are showing me. But for Barbara Walters, and the guy complaining loudly on his cell phone about the breastfeeding mom across the aisle, I have a message: Yeah, I know, our exposed breasts are uncomfortably close to you, thanks to sardine-style airplane seating. But which would you rather have: An infant eating quietly on the ascent and descent, or one screaming his lungs out because his ears won't pop? I'd take the exposed breast and the quiet baby any day... but then, I'd also take the screaming baby over you and your shouted cell phone conversation, too, asshole.

<p>When Aaron and I were traveling in Southeast Asia, I have to admit I was surprised whenever I saw a woman literally pop her breast out for her child for about...a day! This was because we saw it EVERYWHERE. After a while it was very refreshing to know that there is absolutely nothing taboo about feeding your child when he or she is hungry. Plus, the fact that we were in third world countries where food can be scarce at times allowed me to be content that the children would not go hungry! So, convention be damned...!</p>

<p>Is it me or doesn't seem just a tad bit MEAN to think that women should not FEED THEIR CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY!?</p>

<p>Hey, I'm just saying.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how irate I am over Barbara Walter's comments.  I live in Brooklyn and almost went to this thing, but felt an intelligent letter to the View would suffice.  I mean even the GOD DAMN POPE supports breast feeding! If you are interested in his take on it. <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2FEED.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2FEED.htm</a>  My own discomfort with breast-feeding in public caused a few painful clogged milk ducts early on as I would foolishly cut feedings short if he got distracted.  Now I know better.  In fact, I think there should be more breast-feeding on Barbara Walter's network and less serial rapists and murderers attacking women on cop/law shows.</p>

<p>Stephen: I don't think it's that people don't want babies to be fed -- it's that they want babies to be fed in a way they're comfortable with (namely, from a spoon or from a bottle, not from a breast).</p>

<p>My childbirth educator said something about breasts that stuck with me (paraphrasing here): 'they encompass and represent the full range of sexuality, from attraction to procreation to providing nutrition.' It stuck with me because I think people (including me) have always tried to characterize breasts as either sex objects OR feeding mechanisms, and she was saying that they're BOTH. Kinda neat.<br />

<p>The thing that's really galling is the hypocrisy.  The guy on the cell phone isn't really offended at seeing a breast--he's mad because he wants to look and has to control himself.</p>

<p>Al and I were conjecturing yesterday about whether the guy he saw peeing in the bushes outside our hotel in Vancouver (I guess he felt since he was taking his dog out to pee, he might as well relieve himself, too) would be offended by a woman breastfeeding in public&#8212;and whether he'd think to use public breastfeeding as justification for *his* public exposure. Al opined that guys who pee in public would never think to compare it with breastfeeding. Maybe they're *hoping* someone will look? (That's the only explanation I can think of&#8212;at least in this case&#8212;since the guy could have peed in his room or in one of the bathrooms off the lobby. Even if he wasn't a guest, his dog would have been welcome; it's a pet-friendly hotel.)</p>
