<h3 class="title">Oh, The Old Minolta</h3>

<p>
A few weeks ago I was down in the basement doing some laundry, and I set Austen on the couch for a few minutes so I could unload the dryer. He looked so cute sitting there that I wanted to get a photo... but I hadn't brought the 10-D downstairs with me. That's when I remembered that I have two or three film cameras, and that they're all in the basement.
</p>

<p>
I pulled out my favorite, my dad's old Minolta x700, and saw that there was indeed a roll of film already in it. (I wasn't sure what kind, since it doesn't have a little window that shows the film canister, and I never put the tab from the film box in the slot designed for that purpose on the back of the camera body.) I finished the roll (which turned out to be Kodak 400CN) and then mailed it to <a href="http://www.photoworkssf.com/" target="a8_win">one of the shops I used to take film to in the Bay Area</a> for processing.
</p>

<p>
When I got the prints and photo CD I'd asked for back in the mail, I discovered that what was on the roll already were snaps I'd taken almost two years to the day prior to the Austen photos. My favorite is <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town/archives/2005/06/on_the_beach.shtml">this one of Al</a>. It's from a rainy weekend we spent in Bodega Bay, just getting away and enjoying each other's company. A couple more photos from that beach will be posted at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town/">about town</a> in the next day or two.
</p>

<p>
I didn't think the ones of Austen were particularly impressive; seeing them made me want to try to get something better. Maybe next time we're out and about I'll bring the lovely old Minolta as well as the super modern Canon.
