<h3 class="title">Princeton, Sunday Morning</h3>

<p>
I actually ordered a present for Al for Father's Day (it still hasn't left the warehouse yet, so it'll obviously be late), but his real gift was time: Time to play a round of golf with his brother. They'd planned to meet halfway between their respectives homes, at a course in central New Jersey. I'd planned to stay home and watch the Boopster. 
</p>

<p>
When I found out (last night) that the course was near Princeton, however, I proposed that Austen and I come along. That way we could listen to Harry Potter together in the car (I've been indoctrinating Al, who's finally succumbed to the delights of Jim Dale's voices), and Austen and I could explore the Princeton campus while Al golfed. A Sunday adventure seemed like more fun than staying in the house awaiting Al's return, and I figured I could drive back if Al was tired from golfing.
</p>

<p>
Everything went according to the new, revised plan: We made more progress on Harry Potter than we usually do when we listen on the iPod at night; Al and his brother had a great time golfing; Austen and I toured the Princeton campus and downtown; I got to spend some quality quiet time with my camera; and we all enjoyed a beer (stout for me, IPA for Carl, and root for Al) and some lunch at the Triumph Brewpub in on Nassau Street before heading home. Al even drove both ways and let Austen and me nap in the back seat. Sweet!

<p>Creepy.  The place hasn't changed in 30 years.  That was my bicycle from 1979 twisted around that rack I think...</p>
