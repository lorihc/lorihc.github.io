<p>
 Austen went for his 5-month checkup today. The weight over/under was 21 lbs., with our specific guesses being 20 lbs. 6 oz. (me) and 22 lbs. even (Al). I usually get killed by going under, but this time I won handily. At first the nurse declared that he weighed 17 lbs. 8 oz, but both of us said, &quot;that can't be right!&quot;, so she weighed him again (much to his dismay&#8212;he screamed loudly and peed all over the place in two great bursts). I don't know what was wrong the first time, but the second time he was clearly over 20 lbs. (20 lbs. 2 oz., when the nurse finally pressed the Hold button). 
</p>
<p>
Al won the height category, but it was close. I'd guessed 26 3/4&quot; and Al guessed 27&quot;; Austen was just a hair under the latter.
He jumped from the 75th to the 90th percentile in height, and his weight  moved back onto the 95th percentile curve from its previous position in outer space. The doctor mentioned that his weight is likely to drop into the 70-75th percentile by his next visit because he'll be more mobile and will burn more calories during his daily activities. (The exersaucer might even be the reason he's not gaining so quickly anymore.)
</p>
<p>
We didn't really have any questions for the doctor; instead, we mostly answered hers. Is he blowing bubbles? Yes. Can he grab things and hold onto them? Yes. Does he roll over? He can, but he'd rather not most of the time. (He can also sit up on his own for short periods, and he even stood up from a seated position on my leg this weekend.) Is he eating any solid food yet? No. Are we going to stick with breastmilk only until 6 months? Yes. We mentioned that he's started biting me during feedings, and we discussed teething rings (all the ones we've found are rather heavy, and we've noticed that Austen prefers gnawing on his key ring; the doctor also recommended refrigerating a damp washcloth and letting him chomp on that).
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/blog/images/tongue_ring.jpg" width="360" height="240" />
</p>
<p>
This was another shot visit (five vaccines administered as  three shots, same as last time), and Austen handled it about the same way. The only difference was that he was already upset about being left, cold and naked, on the scale&#8212;twice!&#8212;so he was in no mood to be put down. I ended up nursing him while the nurse stabbed him with the needles, and before and after the squirt of Tylenol (which he cried over, but didn't seem to be as bothered by as last time). He hollered for a couple minutes when I had to pop him off and put his clothes back on, but when I flipped him  into the Bjorn, he returned to his usual amiable self. He later slept for two hours in the stroller while I ran errands on foot, and he woke up happy.
</p>
<p>
At the moment the little guy is in the exersaucer, sucking his thumb, listening to iTunes,  watching the photos from the camera get imported into iPhoto (I wonder if he recognizes himself&#8212;like, &quot;hey, I know that guy! I've seen him in the mirror!&quot;?), and looking very fashionable in his first pair of <a href="http://www.robeez.com/" target="a8_win">Robeez</a>, which I caved and bought for him this weekend. He can now stand almost flat-footed in the exersaucer when it's on its highest setting, believe it or not.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/blog/images/robeez_puppies.jpg" width="360" height="240" />
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the babysitter arrangement continues to work well, though I am having some work/life balance issues as a big milestone approaches (er, that would be product development milestone, not baby development milestone). I am feeling alternately exhilarated by the amount of work I can get done,  guilty for the amount I am not able to do, and like a horrible person/mother for sometimes giving my computer more attention than I  give my child. (This last observation was made by someone who didn't *intend* to hurt me, but it nevertheless wounded me deeply. I very nearly called a halt to the contracting because of it, and it's been in the back of my mind every moment since it was uttered. I'll probably write another post devoted solely to my angst over this issue at some point, but not right now.) 
</p>
<p>
In summary: Austen is &quot;perfect&quot;, according to our warm and enthusiastic pediatrician; he's healthy, happy, and huge. I am doing almost as well, although there's this gaping wound in my heart that I have to do something about. And K, our babysitter, is great. She's coming again tomorrow, when I hope to carve out some time to post more photos and write about the weather.

<h3 class="title">My First Mother's Day</h3>

<p>
I think of Mother's Day as my mother's day, probably because her birthday (May 9) often falls on Mother's Day, and even when it doesn't we usually celebrate the two occasions together. But since <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ratphooey/">ratphooey</a> just IMed (while I was in the kitchen doing dishes and not in front of the computer, sadly) to wish me an early Happy Mother's Day, I figured I'd acknowledge that ping here and say a few words about what it's like for me to be a mother.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
joyful . wonderful . amazing . sweet<br />
tiring<br />
time-consuming<br />
enlightening . maddening . emotional<br />
heart-rending . hopeful<br />
educational . endearing<br />  
unnerving<br />
unending
</p>

<p>
This year we will not be celebrating Mother's Day in my honor. It seems a little strange to pick one day to acknowledge my motherhood, when I'm reminded by it&#8212;rewarded by it and rent by it&#8212;every day. Someday, maybe, when Austen is old enough to make me a card at school, I will celebrate Mother's Day for me. Until then, the day belongs to mom.

<h3 class="title">Leaky III: Revenge of the Milk (and the Pee and the Poop)</h3>

<p>
I could easily write a lengthy post on this topic (well, if I had enough time with two hands free), but since Austen will likely only amuse himself in the exersaucer for another five minutes or so, allow me to summarize:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Both</strong> boobs leaked more milk than the coussinets could absorb last night, and I woke up at 3am with a completely saturated bra (luckily, I was on my back, so I didn't soak through my shirt and the sheets).</li>
<li>At the 6:30am feeding, I grabbed Austen's side to roll him toward me and found that his diaper had leaked. His suit was soaked on the right side. I did a very bleary-eyed diaper and onesie change at 7:00am, and when Austen wouldn't go back to sleep (or stop kicking and punching me), I plopped him in the exersaucer next to the bed.</li>
<li>At 7:30am, after much grunting and squealing (and therefore no more sleep for me), Austen started to scream that he wanted out of the exersaucer. Al was good enough to lift him out, and when he did, I smelled poop. "Check his diaper," I said sleepily. "I smell poop." Al replied that he didn't smell anything (but then, he almost never does), so he put Austen back in the bed. A few minutes later, Al said, "oh, I smell poop now, too." Well, ladies and gents, there was a reason for that: Austen's diaper had leaked again, this time utterly ruining one of the cute Gymboree onesies that Larry and Kaori got for us (and which I'd <em>finally</em> found a pair of pants to match on Thursday). &lt;sigh&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>
For those of you who prefer to skip to the punch line, I now present a summary of the summary:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
LOTS OF LEAKS, NOT ENOUGH SLEEP.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Not What I Had in Mind</h3>

<p>
We were planning to start Austen on solid foods when he turned 6 months, which is at the end of this month. I was thinking we'd try avocado, since it's mushy and nutritious and he didn't seem to mind the little taste of it I gave him when we were in California. If avocado didn't go over well, I figured we'd try sweet potato. (I was planning to avoid rice cereal; too conventional.) I liked <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ratphooey/" target="a8_win">ratphooey's</a> choice of gelato for Alexander (because they were in Italy at the time) and considered trying something uniquely Canadian while we're in Vancouver at the end of the month. I've been having a brain block, however, and haven't been able to think of any food that's uniquely Canadian besides back bacon.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it doesn't much matter now. Austen has taken the choice of his first food out of my hands by snarfing down my Hockey North America Summer League flyer. I wonder if he'll be horrified to know, when he's twenty, that his first food was... paper.
</p>

<h3 class="title">It's All Just a Dim Memory Now</h3>

<p>
On the day I went off the pill last year, I started a private blog about our quest for a kid (it's not online at the moment; I never reconstructed it after the rm -r debacle). The &quot;baby blog&quot; was the outlet for all my fears, anxieties, and excitement about the prospect of becoming a parent, a place where I could say I'M PREGNANT! before I could really tell anyone besides Al. And because only Al and I were reading it, there was no thought I couldn't express for fear of hurting someone's feelings or inviting a barrage of critical comments.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/us_exhausted.jpg" alt="austen in my arms, about 14 hours old" width="240" height="360" class="inline-right">I honestly can't remember whether I'd intended, when I started it, to keep writing in the baby blog after the baby was born, but I know that I spent the first couple weeks of his life wishing I had the time, energy, and free appendages to record what was happening. I know I wrote about some of it here (thank god), but I have this vague memory of wishing I had a private place to tell all without shame or guilt. I wish that even more now, when so much of that time is slipping from my memory.
</p>
<p>
You know how people say that you forget the pain of childbirth? I think it's more that you remember that there *was* pain, but you can't remember exactly what it felt like... and that the same is true of the first weeks and months of caring for a newborn. It's only when Al and I think very hard and remind each other of specific moments that we can piece together what it was like to be at the hospital those first four days, to be at home with Austen those first two weeks, to have Austen sleeping in the Pack 'n Play at the foot of our bed for four months. There *was* a time when we never slept more than 2-3 hours at a time (and when I could hardly sleep at all), when it was so painful to breastfeed that I cried every time Austen latched on, when I was so swollen from the IVs that my feet looked like bear claws, when a trip to Maryland took 5 hours instead of 2.
</p>
<p>
Al remembers that he used to drive Austen up and down I-95 so he'd stop screaming (and so I could get some sleep), but he'd forgotten about the times that he'd fallen asleep himself with his arm hanging over the side of the Pack 'N Play, holding the binky in Austen's mouth. I'd nearly forgotten that the reason for my twice-daily walks used to be that it was the only way to keep Austen from nursing every hour (now it's more to give my arms a rest). I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting, which makes me a bit sad, but I suppose it's the only way we can move forward with enthusiasm. For most people, it's probably also the only way they can consider having another child.
</p>
<p>
That's partly why we keep having these &quot;remember when&quot; discussions; we want to make sure we don't do something insane like get pregnant again. (When I was the age Austen is now, my mom was three months pregnant with my sister&mdash;thanks to some misinformation about the efficacy of breastfeeding as a means of birth control.) While I purposely didn't have my tubes tied during the C-section&mdash;I wanted to keep my options open, given that I never thought I'd have even one child&mdash;I think we'll probably count ourselves incredibly lucky to have gotten such a beautiful, healthy baby the first time, and not tempt fate (or our capacities for patience and lack of sleep) by trying for a second one. We admire people who can do it, but I don't think we're two of them.
</p>
<p>
Of course, we could always change our minds... though with this post here to remind us, the memory of how hard it was to care for an infant *without* a toddler in the house will never fade completely. This cute photo will be here to remind us, too, should Austen someday become a two year-old tyrant, why we decided to have even one. We love you, buddy. And that's something we'll never forget.

<h3 class="title">Mistaken Identity</h3>

<p>
Last Tuesday I had my first dentist appointment since moving to Philadelphia (I need a crown and two fillings, gah). The dentist's office is in Al's building, and you have to check in at the security desk and get a pass before you can go up. When I arrived at the desk, there were two security guards, one of which was helping a man who couldn't remember the phone number of the person he was there to see, and the other of whom was on the phone. There were two ledgers, one in front of each guard, and a clipboard in a notch at the center of the desk. 
</p>

<p>
The ledger in front of the guard on the phone was free, but I wasn't sure if both ledgers were essentially the same, or whether you had to sign in a particular one depending on whom you were there to see. I caught the not-on-the-phone guard's attention, pointed at the ledger, and said, "sign in here?" Instead, he pointed at the clipboard. "But that says 'COURIERS ONLY'," I said. He nodded. I stared at him for a second, and then said, "I'm not a courier." He looked surprised. "You're not?"
</p>

<p>
Maybe it was the hair? Certainly couldn't have been the stroller... could it?

Remember how I said Austen's first food was paper? It's also been his second, third, fourth, and so on: If he's in the Bjorn when I'm opening the mail, he'll grab it and stuff it into his mouth with stunning quickness and force. (It reminds me a bit of a shark attack: one minute he's eyeing a solicitation from Capital One calmly, the next minute he's ripped it out of my hand and shoved it down his maw.) He regularly gnaws on paper towels, and he's made a meal of several napkins (to the amusement of both us and a waiter at Hamburger Mary's, and to the horror of my mother-in-law).
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/blog/images/napkin_snarfing.jpg" alt="austen, snarfing down a napkin" width="360" height="240" />
</p>
<p>
The other morning when Austen awoke at 5:30 or so, I discovered that his sleeper suit was wet (yes, he'd had a bath the night before, and as usual, his diaper leaked; he's definitely not drinking the bath water, and we put a larger size diaper on him, so we're still going with the penis-in-the-wrong-position theory). I was too tired to re-dress him, so I stripped off the suit and onesie and tossed him into our bed semi-naked. I don't think I've seen him asleep half-naked since he was in the hospital, so I snapped a photo.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

</p><p>
 On Saturday we joined in a neighborhood sidewalk sale and managed to get rid of about half of the extra stuff that doesn't really fit into our lives/house anymore. Al snapped this photo about an hour in, I think:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/blog/images/the_sale.jpg" width="360" height="240" alt="austen and I try to attract customers" />
</p><p>
During the sale we also managed to snap photos of each other with the same enthusiastic smiles on our faces:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/blog/images/sale_day_lori.jpg" width="360" height="240" alt="me at the sale" /><br />
<img src="/blog/images/sale_day_al.jpg" width="240" height="360" alt="al at the sale" />
</p>
<p>
On Sunday morning we drove down to Virginia to visit Al's parents, and we spent the night so I could get to an appointment nearby more easily on Monday. We had some extra time before the appointment, so we stopped at a local mall and got me a new pair of glasses (I tried contacts for all of two days last week, but I found that I could neither tolerate them for more than two hours, nor see well enough to work, so I'll be returning them to the eye doctor tomorrow). 
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/blog/images/glasses.jpg" width="240" height="81" alt="my new glasses" />
</p>
<p>
Upon our return on Monday evening we discovered that the rhododendron in our front garden had bloomed for the first time since we moved in 18 months ago. (Yay! It likes us! It really, really likes us!)
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

In honor of the occasion, I dyed my hair to match.

<h3 class="title">Looby, Shattered</h3>

<p>
While vacuuming the kitchen this morning, I got the cord to the vacuum wrapped around my Loobylu mug and yanked it to the hard, tile floor. Needless to say, it shattered. :(
</p>

<p>
The mug had been fading for months, thanks to our overzealous dishwasher, but I was still very much attached to this mug. It captured a moment in time, a moment when I was just starting to read other blogs. <a href="http://www.loobylu.com/" target="a8_win">Loobylu</a> was among the first of my daily reads.
</p>

<p>
I know I can get another Looby mug, but it won't be the same. Looby looks different now, and I don't think this design is available anymore. &lt;sigh&gt; At least I'll have the memory of my last mug of tea with Looby, and of Austen reaching for it with both hands, raising it to his mouth, and making what he thought was the same sucking motion I was making at the rim.

Tomorrow morning we are leaving for Vancouver so I can play in my favorite hockey tournament (and my first hockey game since getting pregnant). I'll attempt to blog about the games via Al's Blackberry; if all goes well, you'll be able to read the posts at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">The Ice Hockey Escapades</a>.
