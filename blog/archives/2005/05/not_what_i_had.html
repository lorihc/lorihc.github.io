<h3 class="title">Not What I Had in Mind</h3>

<p>
We were planning to start Austen on solid foods when he turned 6 months, which is at the end of this month. I was thinking we'd try avocado, since it's mushy and nutritious and he didn't seem to mind the little taste of it I gave him when we were in California. If avocado didn't go over well, I figured we'd try sweet potato. (I was planning to avoid rice cereal; too conventional.) I liked <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ratphooey/" target="a8_win">ratphooey's</a> choice of gelato for Alexander (because they were in Italy at the time) and considered trying something uniquely Canadian while we're in Vancouver at the end of the month. I've been having a brain block, however, and haven't been able to think of any food that's uniquely Canadian besides back bacon.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it doesn't much matter now. Austen has taken the choice of his first food out of my hands by snarfing down my Hockey North America Summer League flyer. I wonder if he'll be horrified to know, when he's twenty, that his first food was... paper.

<p>Don't dismiss rice cereal out of hand.  It's easy to transition to, because you can mix it with breast milk, and he'll enjoy the familiarity, easy for a nearly unchallenged tummy to digest, and most importantly, it's iron fortified.  Right about now, around six months, even if you're taking all the vitamins you should, you are running low on iron, and your milk is growing iron poor.  And yes, avocado is a great early food!  Miranda loved it and still does!</p>

<p>Just go to Capogiro and do the gelato thing!  It's as good as the best we had in Italy, truly.</p>

<p>Sweet potatoes are a big favorite of Alexander's.  Almost as popular as pears, they are.  He also loves the YoBaby peach yogurt.</p>

<p>I love Capogiro -- and did you know that the new DiBruno Bros. store on Chestnut also has a limited selection of Capogiro's gelato? It's closer to us than the Capogiro shop, which will be nice when the weather's hot (although the longer walk is good for burning *off* the gelato...).</p>

<p>Re: Iron, I wonder about that. I should get my blood tested to find out, but I wouldn't be surprised to find that my iron levels were fine. During pregnancy the docs were just that when they discovered my iron levels hadn't dropped in the third trimester, as expected. I think the only time they dipped slightly was after the C-section; apparently I lost a lot of blood during the surgery. (Ugh, just thinking of the surgery reminds me of that rack with all the blood-soaked rags in it...)</p>

<p>The spousage read in the Daily News the other day that Capogiro is opening a western outpost in the vicinity of 20th and Sansom, so you can go there instead of DiBruno's.</p>

<p>Er, you can still go to DiBruno's, because CHEESE.  But get the nice, fresh gelato at the source.</p>

<p>That rocks, yo! Capogiro in the 'hood! I was just thinking yesterday that we should meet with the kiddies in Rittenhouse Square one of these days -- and a side trip for gelato sounds like just the thing.</p>

<p>And oh, yes, CHEESE. Love it, will be checking selection at the Bros' place.</p>

<p>Square!  Meet!  Yes!</p>

<p>I am bad about checking back here for responses.  Mea culpa.</p>

<p>Friday, Monday or Tuesday are free.  I should check the weather forecast, I suppose.  Pesky weather.</p>
