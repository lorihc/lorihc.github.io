Remember how I said Austen's first food was paper? It's also been his second, third, fourth, and so on: If he's in the Bjorn when I'm opening the mail, he'll grab it and stuff it into his mouth with stunning quickness and force. (It reminds me a bit of a shark attack: one minute he's eyeing a solicitation from Capital One calmly, the next minute he's ripped it out of my hand and shoved it down his maw.) He regularly gnaws on paper towels, and he's made a meal of several napkins (to the amusement of both us and a waiter at Hamburger Mary's, and to the horror of my mother-in-law).
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<p>
The other morning when Austen awoke at 5:30 or so, I discovered that his sleeper suit was wet (yes, he'd had a bath the night before, and as usual, his diaper leaked; he's definitely not drinking the bath water, and we put a larger size diaper on him, so we're still going with the penis-in-the-wrong-position theory). I was too tired to re-dress him, so I stripped off the suit and onesie and tossed him into our bed semi-naked. I don't think I've seen him asleep half-naked since he was in the hospital, so I snapped a photo.

 On Saturday we joined in a neighborhood sidewalk sale and managed to get rid of about half of the extra stuff that doesn't really fit into our lives/house anymore. Al snapped this photo about an hour in, I think:
</p>

</p><p>
During the sale we also managed to snap photos of each other with the same enthusiastic smiles on our faces:
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<p>
On Sunday morning we drove down to Virginia to visit Al's parents, and we spent the night so I could get to an appointment nearby more easily on Monday. We had some extra time before the appointment, so we stopped at a local mall and got me a new pair of glasses (I tried contacts for all of two days last week, but I found that I could neither tolerate them for more than two hours, nor see well enough to work, so I'll be returning them to the eye doctor tomorrow). 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Upon our return on Monday evening we discovered that the rhododendron in our front garden had bloomed for the first time since we moved in 18 months ago. (Yay! It likes us! It really, really likes us!)
</p>

In honor of the occasion, I dyed my hair to match.

<p>Ha, Spongebob looked comfortable in that chair. <br />
I can't believe how close your hair really matches the flower - nicely done!</p>

<p>What a great post!  So much going on.</p>

<p>Alexander likes to gnaw on paper, too.  So far, I don't think he's actually swallowed any, though he nearly choked on a straw wrapper no one noticed he'd swiped.  Well, there was no choking, but he'd gummed the thing flat, at which point it adhered to the roof of his mouth, where I spotted it and got it out.</p>

<p>I envy you your decluttering!  Must get right on that.  Yeah.</p>
