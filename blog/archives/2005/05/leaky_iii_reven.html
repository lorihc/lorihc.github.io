<h3 class="title">Leaky III: Revenge of the Milk (and the Pee and the Poop)</h3>

<p>
I could easily write a lengthy post on this topic (well, if I had enough time with two hands free), but since Austen will likely only amuse himself in the exersaucer for another five minutes or so, allow me to summarize:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Both</strong> boobs leaked more milk than the coussinets could absorb last night, and I woke up at 3am with a completely saturated bra (luckily, I was on my back, so I didn't soak through my shirt and the sheets).</li>
<li>At the 6:30am feeding, I grabbed Austen's side to roll him toward me and found that his diaper had leaked. His suit was soaked on the right side. I did a very bleary-eyed diaper and onesie change at 7:00am, and when Austen wouldn't go back to sleep (or stop kicking and punching me), I plopped him in the exersaucer next to the bed.</li>
<li>At 7:30am, after much grunting and squealing (and therefore no more sleep for me), Austen started to scream that he wanted out of the exersaucer. Al was good enough to lift him out, and when he did, I smelled poop. "Check his diaper," I said sleepily. "I smell poop." Al replied that he didn't smell anything (but then, he almost never does), so he put Austen back in the bed. A few minutes later, Al said, "oh, I smell poop now, too." Well, ladies and gents, there was a reason for that: Austen's diaper had leaked again, this time utterly ruining one of the cute Gymboree onesies that Larry and Kaori got for us (and which I'd <em>finally</em> found a pair of pants to match on Thursday). &lt;sigh&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p>
For those of you who prefer to skip to the punch line, I now present a summary of the summary:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
LOTS OF LEAKS, NOT ENOUGH SLEEP.

<p>Lori a trick for night time leaks...(ok 2 out of 3)</p>

<p>Try using the next size up diaper at night.  It holds more and since that's usually the longest spell with no diaper change is might help.</p>

<p>Also that onesie is probably not ruined. Poop comes out, if you soak it with some detergent.</p>

<p>Cheers<br />

<p>I second the above comment.</p>

<p>I even got poop out of the silk shirt I was wearing when Alexander's diaper leaked on my lap.</p>

<p>I don't know whether we're using crap detergent (no pun intended) or what, but I've noticed that when there's as much poop on the onesie as there is in the diaper, no amount of soaking gets the stain out. It might get the actual poop off (after a couple washings), yes, but not the stain. Thus the Hylan-Cho Poop Policy: "If the onesie looks like the inside of a diaper, treat it like a diaper and toss it into the pail." </p>
