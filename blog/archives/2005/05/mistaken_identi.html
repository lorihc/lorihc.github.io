<h3 class="title">Mistaken Identity</h3>

<p>
Last Tuesday I had my first dentist appointment since moving to Philadelphia (I need a crown and two fillings, gah). The dentist's office is in Al's building, and you have to check in at the security desk and get a pass before you can go up. When I arrived at the desk, there were two security guards, one of which was helping a man who couldn't remember the phone number of the person he was there to see, and the other of whom was on the phone. There were two ledgers, one in front of each guard, and a clipboard in a notch at the center of the desk. 
</p>

<p>
The ledger in front of the guard on the phone was free, but I wasn't sure if both ledgers were essentially the same, or whether you had to sign in a particular one depending on whom you were there to see. I caught the not-on-the-phone guard's attention, pointed at the ledger, and said, "sign in here?" Instead, he pointed at the clipboard. "But that says 'COURIERS ONLY'," I said. He nodded. I stared at him for a second, and then said, "I'm not a courier." He looked surprised. "You're not?"
</p>

<p>
Maybe it was the hair? Certainly couldn't have been the stroller... could it?
