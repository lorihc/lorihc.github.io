<p>
I was thinking that I hadn't spent the time during which the babysitter was here today very wisely&#8212;I mostly finished the post I started last night for this blog, vacuumed, worked on improving the layout and navigation over at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">the ice hockey escapades</a>, started but didn't finish a note to Valerie, and moped about having a cold&#8212;but as it turns out, this was probably a pretty good use of my time. It's not even midnight yet, and since the babysitter left at 5:40pm I've managed to feed myself, put the Boopster to bed, watch a TV program I wanted to see, edit all the hockey photos I want to upload to my new team's site, clean up the kitchen, pay bills, do some financial research, upload a few photos to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/">Flickr</a>, take a shower, and listen to an archived episode of <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&prgDate=6-Oct-05" target="a8_win">Fresh Air</a>. I managed to do those things because I got all the high-priority web work, house-cleaning, and moping out of the way earlier. Man, I'm good.
