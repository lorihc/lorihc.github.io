<p>
When I went down to see Allison and her 6 week-old, Nora, a couple weeks ago, I was struck by how tiny Nora was. It was odd thinking that Austen was ever that small, but of course he was born even smaller. When Austen hit 10 lbs., I remember worrying that I wouldn't be able to lift him at all if he got any heavier, but I could hold 10-pound Nora in one arm. (Obviously, my body has adapted as Austen's grown; I actually have functioning biceps now. :)
</p>
<p>
Most of the time Austen still seems little to me, but I think it's because I measure him against me&#8212;and next to me, he *is* pretty tiny. Next to Nora, however, he looks like he swallowed something radioactive, as this photo (taken by Allison) attests:

<p>yes, indeed! we got that shirt when we went to Vancouver for Memorial Day Weekend. I'm glad 24 months was the smallest size they had, or we'd have been tempted to go smaller -- and he'd have outgrown it by now!</p>
