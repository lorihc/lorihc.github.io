<h3 class="title">Looking at the Logs</h3>

<p>
I'm finding a lot of hilarious (and not-so-hilarious) stuff in my referrer logs. It turns out like a third of my traffic is from people linking directly to the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2004/10/and_there_was_m.html">Red Sox logo</a> (and by directly, I mean including the actual image in their pages with an http link, not linking to the post), which irritated me enough to turn off hotlinking of images. Let me know if this interferes with your ability to see any images in their proper context.
</p>
<p>
Among the hilarious stuff was this entry on <a href="http://www.hairfinder.com/" target="a8_win">hairfinder.com</a> (yes, it's true: everything you ever wanted to know *is* on the web):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/cam_archives/032201_0421001.html">Avocado - hairstyle change</a><br />
The hair cuts of a young lady. Browse through her many webcam images and see
her evolution from mid-length to really short punky hair in daring colors like purple
and pink.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For some reason they link to the third page of the Gallery of Silly Faces (aka the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/webcam.html">webcam archives</a>) instead of to the intro page; I should probably put a link back to the intro so that visitors from hairfinder can find their way around.

<p>Even worse than the bandwidth theft were the photos people linked to from inane message boards. Nothing like seeing a photo of Austen turn up in a posting about drinking all night. (Not that turning off hotlinking will deter image thieves in general, but it will prevent the casual Google Images searcher from linking to stuff from my site out of context.)</p>
