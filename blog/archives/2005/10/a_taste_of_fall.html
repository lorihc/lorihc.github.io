<h3 class="title">A Taste of Fall</h3>

<p>
These are REALLY, REALLY yummy:
</p>

<p>
1 package Trader Joe's pumpkin bread/muffin mix<br />
1/3 c. fresh pumpkin, bought at farmer's market yesterday and steam-roasted this morning, pureed<br />
1 T. oil<br />
2 T. Trader Joe's pumpkin butter<br />
2 large eggs<br />
1 c. water<br />
1/2 bag semi-sweet chocolate chips
</p>

<p>
Mix according to package directions (fold dry into wet), then stir in chips. Grease 18 muffin tins (or use liners) and fill each 2/3 full. Bake 16-20 minutes at 400&deg;.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Note: I made these with all pumpkin butter and no fresh pumpkin the other day, and they were tasty, but the fresh pumpkin gives them a buttery, homemade, OH SO DELICIOUS flavor. Plus, the excess pumpkin puree will make several meals for Austen.

<p>Ooh, yummy!</p>

<p>In other muffin news, the local farmer's market will have unpasteurized apple cider next week.  There will be cider cupcakes.</p>

<p>Awesome! I saw some yesterday and thought of you (and of making those cider cupcakes myself ;).</p>

<p>Those do look yummy!  I thought of you today when we drove by Mitchell's ice cream on the way to work & noticed the "Pumpkin is back!" sign on the window ;-)</p>

<p>yes, it's true, I like all things pumpkin (especially pumpkin ice cream!). I've long said that one of the best things about having an October birthday is that you can get pumpkin cake at many bakeries. </p>

<p>I have to say, I may never eat/use pumpkin from a can again after cooking that one from the farmer's market myself. it was amazingly delicious with no seasonings whatsoever. </p>

<p>Like you, I'm a total pumpkin foodie. On the non-edible front, Bath & Body Works has pumpkin hand soap, lotion and those room scent plug-ins. I still have some pumpkin body lotion from last year and wore it to hockey recently. The ref commented that I smelled good (quite an achievement when sweating profusely). Interesting factoid, a study showed men respond positively to pumpkin scent as an aphrodisiac far more than floral scents. Who knew! :-) </p>

<p>Sadly I am allergic to virtually everything in Bath &amp; Body Works, so I never go into the store anymore. (There used to be a vanilla body wash that didn't give me hives, migraines, or allergy attacks, but I don't think they make it anymore.) I wonder if the pumpkin line would be safe? I should send my sister in there on a reconnaissance mission. :)</p>

<p>I made the muffins last night and they're divine. I left out the fresh pumpkin and added 1 tsp more oil to compensate for the moisture loss. They've received rave reviews (and made the house smell yummy). The chocolate chips were inspired. Thanks much! :-)</p>

<p>Glad you liked them, Sally! I'm going to be baking my fourth batch&#8212;with a pumpkin I bought this morning from the Rittenhouse farmer's market&#8212;tomorrow night. YUM!</p>
