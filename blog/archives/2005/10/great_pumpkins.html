<h3 class="title">Great Pumpkins</h3>

<p>
As I mentioned in the comments of the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/10/a_taste_of_fall.html">pumpkin muffin post</a>, I love all things pumpkin. To demonstrate my dedication to this tasty fall treat and share with others the pumpkin possibilities, I herewith offer some of my recent pumpkin finds. [I reserve the right to revise and extend this post as I eat my way around town.]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pumpkin Eclair from <a href="http://www.metropolitanbakery.com/locations.html" target="a8_win">Metropolitan Bakery</a> ~ </strong>Why didn't I think to photograph this beautiful pastry before I ate it the other day? It was the perfect mix of earthy and elegant&#8212;definitely not your average home-style dessert. Great pumpkin flavor in the custard.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pumpkin Soup at <a href="http://www.triumphbrewing.com/indexfl6.html" target="a8_win">Triumph Brewery</a> ~ </strong>I've been wanting a meal of beer and soup for over a week (i.e., about as long as it's been raining here in Philadelphia), and I finally got it at Triumph Brewery in Princeton on Thursday. That Pumpkin was the soup of the day was great news; even better was that it was vegetarian. (For some reason, many restaurants feel the need to "flavor" what would otherwise be incredibly tasty vegetable soups with chicken stock.) I ordered a bowl of soup and a half-pint of the Oktoberfest. I preferred Rock Bottom's version of the martzen, but the soup was very good: Thick and savory with a strong pumpkin flavor. I usually like dunking bread in pumpkin soup (OK, any thick/creamy soup) and was at first sad I hadn't been offered any, but the soup portion was so large and the consistency so thick that I didn't really need bread.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pumpkin Whoopie Pies from Fisher's Bakery in the <a href="http://nacho.princeton.edu/~klein/shotofood/princetonfood.html#shopping">Kingston PA Dutch Farmers Market</a> ~ </strong>You can get pumpkin whoopie pies at the PA Dutch bakeries in the Reading Terminal Market and at the <a href="http://www.padutchmarket.com/" target="a8_win">market in Cockeysville, MD</a>, but the ones at Fisher's get my vote for the best ever. The pumpkin cakes are perfect, and the filling is <em>just sweet enough</em>. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pumpkin Torte from <a href="http://readingterminalmarket.org/merchantView.php?id=35" target="a8_win">Glick's Salads</a> ~ </strong>Again, you can get versions of this pumpkin dessert (which might be called Pumpkin Delight instead of Pumpkin torte; I can never remember the exact name) at the salad/deli/cheese stand in any PA Dutch market, but I like the one at Glick's best. It's like a cross between pumpkin pie and pumpkin pudding, with a cheesecake/Jell-O hybrid layer between the pumpkin part and the graham cracker crust. OK, I realize this sounds weird, but it's yummy&#8212;and it's only available through Thanksgiving. Get it while you can!
