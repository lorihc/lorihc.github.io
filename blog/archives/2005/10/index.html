<h3 class="title">A Taste of Fall</h3>

<p>
These are REALLY, REALLY yummy:
</p>

<p>
1 package Trader Joe's pumpkin bread/muffin mix<br />
1/3 c. fresh pumpkin, bought at farmer's market yesterday and steam-roasted this morning, pureed<br />
1 T. oil<br />
2 T. Trader Joe's pumpkin butter<br />
2 large eggs<br />
1 c. water<br />
1/2 bag semi-sweet chocolate chips
</p>


<p>
Mix according to package directions (fold dry into wet), then stir in chips. Grease 18 muffin tins (or use liners) and fill each 2/3 full. Bake 16-20 minutes at 400&deg;.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Note: I made these with all pumpkin butter and no fresh pumpkin the other day, and they were tasty, but the fresh pumpkin gives them a buttery, homemade, OH SO DELICIOUS flavor. Plus, the excess pumpkin puree will make several meals for Austen.

<h3 class="title">Gigantor</h3>

<p>
When I went down to see Allison and her 6 week-old, Nora, a couple weeks ago, I was struck by how tiny Nora was. It was odd thinking that Austen was ever that small, but of course he was born even smaller. When Austen hit 10 lbs., I remember worrying that I wouldn't be able to lift him at all if he got any heavier, but I could hold 10-pound Nora in one arm. (Obviously, my body has adapted as Austen's grown; I actually have functioning biceps now. :)
</p>

<p>
Most of the time Austen still seems little to me, but I think it's because I measure him against me&#8212;and next to me, he *is* pretty tiny. Next to Nora, however, he looks like he swallowed something radioactive, as this photo (taken by Allison) attests:

<h3 class="title">My, Oh Miers</h3>

<p>
I think Al thought I was arguing in support of Harriet Miers' nomination to the Supremem Court the other night when I suggested that she might have had some experience writing opinions on Constitutional issues during her tenure at the White House, but I wasn't. At the time, I was reserving judgement. Although I found it deeply creepy that Bush thought it was appropriate to appoint someone on the basis of personal friendship and loyalty, and I suspected that anyone Bush valued as highly as he says he values Miers would be unlikely to oppose any of Bush's views or objectives (because Bush tends to surround himself with yes-men and -women), I wanted to hear more about Miers' background and qualifications, as well as her views on the role of the Court and its justices from her own mouth.
</p>


<p>
I've yet to hear anything from Harriet Miers, but the more I hear about her from Bush and other conservatives, the more my hair stands on end. Could Bush have been more squirrelly during that news conference yesterday when a reporter repeatedly asked him about whether he'd asked Miers what her views were on abortion? His last assertion, that he couldn't "recall ever sitting down with her," was a cross between a dodge and a bald-faced lie. It's not so much her position on abortion that worried me after I heard the exchange; it was that Bush was so totally unwilling to answer the question(s) about it. A Supreme Court nomination should not be shrouded in secrecy and lies, period, but does anyone else find it unnerving that they're designed to hide something more from the Right than the Left?
</p>
<p>
This concern seems to be borne out by an article on the Washington Post's website called "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/04/AR2005100401765.html" target="a8_win">Strong Grounding in the Church Could Be a Clue to Miers's Priorities</a>", which on the surface sounds like an alarm to the Left, but which is full of quotes from the far Right regarding their dismay at Miers' lack of conservative credentials. It's a head shaker, that's for sure. Excerpt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Even in Dallas, home of groups such as the Texas Eagle Forum and the Republican National Coalition for Life, some religious conservatives say Miers, 60, has demonstrated an insufficient commitment to family values. They cited a questionnaire she filled out for a gay rights group in 1989 as a candidate for Dallas City Council, indicating that gay people should have the same civil rights as straight people and that the city should fund AIDS education and services. After her election, she appointed an openly gay lawyer to an influential city board.
</p>
<p>
&quot;For goodness' sake, why elevate AIDS over cancer? She shouldn't have filled out that questionnaire at all,&quot; said Cathie Adams, president of the Texas Eagle Forum. &quot;President Bush is asking us to have faith in things unseen. We only have that kind of faith in God.&quot;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here's the head-shaking part for me: What about stating a belief that the municipal government should provide AIDS education and services says that you're &quot;elevat[ing] AIDS over cancer&quot;? These are the same folks who think that asking to be treated as an actual human, a contributing member of society&#8212;with the same rights and privileges as other members of society&#8212;is asking for something &quot;special&quot;. Puh-LEASE. 
</p>
<p>
In any case, after resisting a knee-jerk opposition to any Bush nominee to the high court, I'm growing more and more concerned about the prospect of a Justice Miers.  I'm curious, however, about how the Left will respond&#8212;and wondering if they even should. Would strong opposition from gay, women's, and abortion rights groups (as well as Democrats) cause the Right to rally behind Miers, despite their reservations? Would quietly opposing Miers give the various right-of-center groups a chance to in-fight it out, so to speak?

<p>
In the time it took me to put on my makeup this morning (i.e., about 4 minutes), the Beaner:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Emptied the "safe" cupboard in the bathroom of a giant container of Softsoap, a lightbulb, an old (but unused) ovulation predictor stick, and a package of pantiliners</li>
<li>Dumped the package of pantiliners all over the floor and scattered them as widely as his little hands could manage</li>
<li>Unraveled an entire roll of toilet paper, then ripped off two sheets and ate them</li>
<li>Dismantled the standalone toilet paper holder and dumped the various small parts amid the pantiliners</li>
<li>Raised himself to a standing position with the aid of the toilet</li>
<li>Flushed the toilet twice</li>
<li>Worked his way around the toilet to the (very heavy) magazine basket and pushed it aside like it was a Kleenex box
<li>Grabbed the bag lining the trash can and started reaching for the mounds of icky crap inside.
</ul>

<p>
That's when I finally put down the mascara and called in the National Guard.

<p>
So I finally bit the bullet and upgraded to MT3.2 despite my concerns about (a) the interface, which I actually find less intuitive and more labor-intensive, and (b) the new comment-management system, which seemed unable to find comments from any unregistered commenters when I  tried out MT3.2 beta 3. I knew the interface wouldn't be changed to suit me, so I figured if I wanted to use any of the new 3.2 features I'd just have to suck it up and get used to it. However, I *had* hoped the comment problem would be solved. Sadly, it hasn't been. I can see the missing comments on individual entries, leading me to hope that they haven't been destroyed, but I can't view them in the comment list no matter how I sort or search. Pisses me off royally.
</p>

<p>
Also, is it just me, or are the docs virtually impossible to understand?

<h3 class="title">Get Up, Stand Up... Scare Your Mom To Death</h3>

<p>
I was saying in an e-mail to Valerie tonight that I only seem to have time these days to write about Austen's milestones OR <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">mine</a>, not both. (Hopefully our new twice-a-week babysitter will help me remedy that, though part of the reason I searched for a sitter in the first place&#8212;so I could attend open hockey sessions at UPenn during the day&#8212;will also generate more hockey blog material with which to keep up.) In any case, since Al is refusing to switch from Monday Night Football to The Apprentice: Martha Stewart on TiVo, and I've lost interest in the game because I've already won my two fantasy league games, I have time to blog about Austen stuff right now.  
</p>



<p>
I mentioned that Austen's been getting on all fours and wiggling around  a lot but rarely going anywhere (except backwards), but the other day I actually witnessed him crawl across the bed to get to my nightstand. Al didn't believe me that he'd crawled &#8212;or at least, he wanted to see it with his own eyes before he'd confirm than an actual forward crawl had occurred. On Saturday he got his chance: While we were waiting for a table at the Rock Bottom Brewery, Al set Austen down on the floor...where he crawled around in a circle and then over to me. It's weird that his crawling skills seem to be developing in tandem with his walking skills (which are really getting good&#8212;he's now taking independent steps between the furniture instead of securing a handhold first).
</p>
<p>
A quick aside to mention our experience at the Rock Bottom Brewery before I continue, mainly because I know if I don't write about it here, I'll never write a separate post about it. We thought it was a fluke when the service completely sucked the last time we ate at the King of Prussia Rock Bottom, but it now appears that it's company policy (a) to understaff the dining room, making for long seating waits despite the many empty tables, and (b) for servers to take drink and appetizer orders and then return 10 minutes later, sans drinks or appetizers, to take entree orders. Both last year's visit and this one had us imploring the server to <em>PLEASE</em> bring us our drinks before putting the entree order in. Sadly, at this visit they'd also run out of the house-brewed root beer (at 4pm!), which is the main reason Al wanted to eat there. The good news is that the appetizer I ordered, a cheese and beer sampler that included apples, grapes, grainy horshradish mustard, summer sausage (which I gave to Al) and lavosh crackers in addition to three kinds of cheese and three kinds of beer, was excellent. One of the cheese types was a little pitcher of fondue, which inspired us to try making fondue for the first time ever on Sunday... but that's another story.
</p>
<p>
Austen, who'd finished his Cheerios and baby food before the drinks arrived, was cruising around under the table when another couple with a 10 month-old was seated next to us. They had a very similar experience to ours in that their baby finished his meal before any sign of adult food or drinks arrived; unlike us, they showed some sense and left when the baby started to squirm (without eating or drinking themselves). They missed out on the excellent cheese and beer sampler (and the $8.30 gallon of the Rocktoberfest brew&#8212;bargain!&#8212;that I got to go), but I still think their course was the wiser one. We'll be making our own cheese platters at home from now on (and getting the beer to go) rather than sitting down at Rock Bottom. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, back at home, for the second time in a week we had trouble getting Austen to bed. It's been the norm for a couple months now to nurse him for a little while and then put him to bed asleep or nearly so with no fuss. One night last week, however, he was refusing to settle down, so we put him in the crib at 8:30 and let him cry for a while. I figured I could take the opportunity to vacuum the house, since I wouldn't be keeping him awake, and the vacuum noice might even soothe him. After 30 minutes, however, he was still screaming inconsolably, so I went into his room to pick him up... and the smell hit me as soon as I opened the door. He'd apparently worked himself into such a frenzy that he pooped. I changed his diaper, nursed him a little more, and then put him to bed without incident.
</p>
<p>
Saturday night was a repeat of the previous incident, only without the vacuuming. Even though Austen seemed to be shouting more than screaming inconsolably after 30 minutes, I went up to check on him just in case all that red-faced hollering had resulted in another poopy diaper. I was already saying, &quot;OK now, what's all the fuss about?&quot; as I opened the door, but &quot;it's bedtime&quot; turned into &quot;it's bedARIEEEEEEEEEEEEEAUGGGGHH!!!!&quot; Austen's crib is just to the right of the door, and there he was&#8212;the VERY SCARY BABY&#8212;standing up at the end of his crib, shouting. Of course, my screaming and leaping about five feet forward into the room scared the crap out of him as well, and he switched from shouting to crying again. It turned out he *had* pooped, though whether his diaper was dirty because he was shouting, or he was shouting because his diaper was dirty, I couldn't tell you. It's also possible that I really did scare the crap out of him; the timing is a little unclear.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I changed his diaper and let him sit on my lap and play  for a while, and then Al put him to bed at about 9:30 (after a long speech about the power of meditation and self-soothing). Al says Austen wasn't asleep when he put him in the crib, but that he was calm. We didn't hear another squeak out of him until 6:30 on Sunday. Needless to say, between football games and fondue on Sunday, Al went up to lower the mattress on the crib from level 3 to level 4. 
</p>
<p style="font-size:smaller">
Eerie aside: On Friday night I dreamed that I asked Al to lower the crib mattress because I was afraid Austen would stand up and fall over the side. Thank god there was no falling involved when Austen did stand in his crib for the first time&#8212;only a near heart attack, and that on my part.

<h3 class="title">More Efficient Than I Realized</h3>

<p>
I was thinking that I hadn't spent the time during which the babysitter was here today very wisely&#8212;I mostly finished the post I started last night for this blog, vacuumed, worked on improving the layout and navigation over at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">the ice hockey escapades</a>, started but didn't finish a note to Valerie, and moped about having a cold&#8212;but as it turns out, this was probably a pretty good use of my time. It's not even midnight yet, and since the babysitter left at 5:40pm I've managed to feed myself, put the Boopster to bed, watch a TV program I wanted to see, edit all the hockey photos I want to upload to my new team's site, clean up the kitchen, pay bills, do some financial research, upload a few photos to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/">Flickr</a>, take a shower, and listen to an archived episode of <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&prgDate=6-Oct-05" target="a8_win">Fresh Air</a>. I managed to do those things because I got all the high-priority web work, house-cleaning, and moping out of the way earlier. Man, I'm good.

<h3 class="title">Great Pumpkins</h3>

<p>
As I mentioned in the comments of the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/10/a_taste_of_fall.html">pumpkin muffin post</a>, I love all things pumpkin. To demonstrate my dedication to this tasty fall treat and share with others the pumpkin possibilities, I herewith offer some of my recent pumpkin finds. [I reserve the right to revise and extend this post as I eat my way around town.]
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pumpkin Eclair from <a href="http://www.metropolitanbakery.com/locations.html" target="a8_win">Metropolitan Bakery</a> ~ </strong>Why didn't I think to photograph this beautiful pastry before I ate it the other day? It was the perfect mix of earthy and elegant&#8212;definitely not your average home-style dessert. Great pumpkin flavor in the custard.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pumpkin Soup at <a href="http://www.triumphbrewing.com/indexfl6.html" target="a8_win">Triumph Brewery</a> ~ </strong>I've been wanting a meal of beer and soup for over a week (i.e., about as long as it's been raining here in Philadelphia), and I finally got it at Triumph Brewery in Princeton on Thursday. That Pumpkin was the soup of the day was great news; even better was that it was vegetarian. (For some reason, many restaurants feel the need to "flavor" what would otherwise be incredibly tasty vegetable soups with chicken stock.) I ordered a bowl of soup and a half-pint of the Oktoberfest. I preferred Rock Bottom's version of the martzen, but the soup was very good: Thick and savory with a strong pumpkin flavor. I usually like dunking bread in pumpkin soup (OK, any thick/creamy soup) and was at first sad I hadn't been offered any, but the soup portion was so large and the consistency so thick that I didn't really need bread.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pumpkin Whoopie Pies from Fisher's Bakery in the <a href="http://nacho.princeton.edu/~klein/shotofood/princetonfood.html#shopping">Kingston PA Dutch Farmers Market</a> ~ </strong>You can get pumpkin whoopie pies at the PA Dutch bakeries in the Reading Terminal Market and at the <a href="http://www.padutchmarket.com/" target="a8_win">market in Cockeysville, MD</a>, but the ones at Fisher's get my vote for the best ever. The pumpkin cakes are perfect, and the filling is <em>just sweet enough</em>. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pumpkin Torte from <a href="http://readingterminalmarket.org/merchantView.php?id=35" target="a8_win">Glick's Salads</a> ~ </strong>Again, you can get versions of this pumpkin dessert (which might be called Pumpkin Delight instead of Pumpkin torte; I can never remember the exact name) at the salad/deli/cheese stand in any PA Dutch market, but I like the one at Glick's best. It's like a cross between pumpkin pie and pumpkin pudding, with a cheesecake/Jell-O hybrid layer between the pumpkin part and the graham cracker crust. OK, I realize this sounds weird, but it's yummy&#8212;and it's only available through Thanksgiving. Get it while you can!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Or You Could WALK</h3>

<p>
When I checked my e-mail this morning I found this, forwarded from a (then-wildly liberal, now-conservative) friend from college. Needless to say, I groaned louder than I do when he attaches several 2MB photos to e-mails sent to me and several other friends. Dude: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="a8_win">Flickr</a>. <a href="http://www.ofoto.com/" target="a8_win">Ofoto</a>. <a href="http://www.smugmug.com" target="a8_win">Smugmug</a>. <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/" target="a8_win">yournamehere.com</a>. And to the following e-mail: WALK. Ride a bike. Consolidate trips. Drive something that gets more than 9 mpg. Oh yeah, and a Halliburton employee as the source of an idea to stick it to the petroleum industry? Hahahahahahahaha!
</p>



<blockquote>
<p>
This was originally sent by a retired Coca Cola executive. It came from one of his engineer buddies who retired from Halliburton. It 's worth your consideration. 
</p>

<p>
Join the resistance!!!! We are probably going to hit close to $ 4.00 a gallon by next summer and it might go higher!! At this writing they are paying $5.60 US per gallon in the UK.  Want gasoline prices to come down?  We need to take some intelligent, united action. 
</p>

<p>
Phillip Hollsworth offered this good idea. This makes MUCH MORE SENSE than the "don't buy gas on a certain day" campaign that was going around last April or May! The oil companies just laughed at that because they knew we wouldn't continue to "hurt" ourselves by refusing to buy gas.  It was more of an inconvenience to us than it was a problem for them. BUT, whoever thought of this idea, has come up with a plan that can really work. Please read on and join with us! 
</p>

<p>
By now you're probably thinking gasoline priced at about $1.50 is super cheap. Me too! It is currently $2.79 for regular unleaded in my town.  Now that the oil companies and the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think that the cost of a gallon of gas is CHEAP at $1.50 - $1.75, we need to take aggressive action to teach them that BUYERS control the marketplace..not sellers. With the price of gasoline going up more each day, we consumers need to take action. The only way we are going to see the price of gas come down is if we hit someone in the pocketbook by not purchasing their gas! And, we can do that WITHOUT hurting ourselves. How? 
</p>

<p>
Since we all rely on our cars, we can't just stop buying gas. But we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all act together to force a price war. 
</p>

<p>
Here's the idea: For the rest of this year, DON'T purchase ANY gasoline from the two biggest companies (which now are one), EXXON and MOBIL.  If they are not selling any gas, they will be inclined to reduce their prices. If they reduce their prices, the other companies will have to follow suit. But to have an impact, we need to reach literally millions of Exxon and Mobil gas buyers. It's really simple to do! Now, don't wimp out on me at this point...keep reading and I'll explain how simple it is to reach millions of people!! 
</p>

<p>
I am sending this note to 30 people. If each of us send it to at least ten more (30 x 10 = 300) ... and those 300 send it to at least ten more (300 x 10 = 3,000)...and so on, by the time the message reaches the sixth group of people, we will have reached over THREE MILLION consumers. 
</p>

<p>
If those three million get excited and pass this on to ten friends each, then 30 million people will have been contacted!  If it goes one level further, you guessed it..... THREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE!!! 
</p>

<p>
Again, all you have to do is send this to 10 people. That's all! 
(If you don't understand how we can reach 300 million and all you have to do is send this to 10 people.... Well, let's face it, you just aren't a mathematician. But I am .. so trust me on this one.) :-) 
</p>

<p>
How long would all that take? If each of us sends this e-mail out to ten more people within one day of receipt, all 300 MILLION people could conceivably be contacted within the next 8 days!!! I'll bet you didn't think you and I had that much potential, did you! Acting together we can make a difference. 
</p>

<p>
If this makes sense to you, please pass this message on. I suggest that we NOT buy from EXXON/MOBIL  UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO THE $1.30 RANGE AND KEEP THEM DOWN. THIS CAN REALLY WORK. 
</p>

<p>
I'm finding a lot of hilarious (and not-so-hilarious) stuff in my referrer logs. It turns out like a third of my traffic is from people linking directly to the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2004/10/and_there_was_m.html">Red Sox logo</a> (and by directly, I mean including the actual image in their pages with an http link, not linking to the post), which irritated me enough to turn off hotlinking of images. Let me know if this interferes with your ability to see any images in their proper context.
</p>

<p>
Among the hilarious stuff was this entry on <a href="http://www.hairfinder.com/" target="a8_win">hairfinder.com</a> (yes, it's true: everything you ever wanted to know *is* on the web):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/cam_archives/032201_0421001.html">Avocado - hairstyle change</a><br />
The hair cuts of a young lady. Browse through her many webcam images and see
her evolution from mid-length to really short punky hair in daring colors like purple
and pink.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For some reason they link to the third page of the Gallery of Silly Faces (aka the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/webcam.html">webcam archives</a>) instead of to the intro page; I should probably put a link back to the intro so that visitors from hairfinder can find their way around.

<h3 class="title">Master Chef to Total Clod</h3>

<p>
I was so PROUD of myself last night for making exactly the meal I wanted from ingredients I already had in the house. I sliced a medium onion (with a knife), sauteed it until browned in a saucepan with a little butter and olive oil, and then added a can of vegetable broth, a dash of dry sherry, and a few grinds of pepper, and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. I then topped it with a toasted slice of Metropolitan Bakery whole wheat sandwich bread (oh, so seedilicious) and a handful of grated gruyere and stuck it in the oven at 275&deg; for about 10 minutes. It was AWESOME, especially accompanied by the sliced Cameo apple I picked myself that afternoon (in a pouring rain, I might add) and a Yuengling Black &amp; Tan (purchased from Pete's Famous Pizza, which is just around the corner, for $2.50). I obviously rocked as a chef, and this amazing onion soup was proof.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/55308465/" title="how do you like them apples? by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/32/55308465_f6efa562f7_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="how do you like them apples?" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Of course, the universe knows a thing or two about hubris. I wanted to use some of the 10 lbs. or so of apples we picked yesterday, so I decided to make an apple buckle/coffee cake. I wanted to make sure the apples were sliced thick enough so we could taste them in the cake, but not so thick that they wouldn't cook properly, so I pulled out the mandoline that Winsha gave us for our wedding three years ago. I'd never used it before because, quite honestly, I was scared to death of the damn thing. I just knew I'd lose a finger using it.
</p>

<p>
I got one Crispin apple sliced perfectly, however, so I thought, "OK, no problem! This isn't so scary!" And then, as I was slicing apple number 2, I looked up to tell Al what kind of butter to buy for me at Trader Joe's. In the middle of a sentence that started, "It's the unsalted European-style butter in the blue and yel......", "yellow" turned into a yell. "ARE YOU OK?" Al asked, loudly but as calmly as possible, since Austen was in the room. I grabbed what was left of my thumb and replied through a clenched jaw, "NOT OK. NOT OK. DEFINITELY NOT OK" while walking very quickly in a loop around the kitchen and dining room and holding a rapidly-reddening dishtowel around my wounded digit.
</p>

<p>
After a few minutes of attempting to hold panic at bay, I started wailing. We couldn't get my thumb to stop bleeding long enough to smear some Neosporin on it, so we finally smeared some on a Band-Aid and managed to get it wrapped around my finger fairly tightly. It took another 10 minutes or so of ice and elevation to get the blood to stop bubbling out the top of the bandage, though. The good news is that Austen showed concern when I was freaking out, but he didn't start crying himself; he stayed calm and out of the way in his Pack 'n Play. I think this was mostly due to Al's efforts to underreact than overreact, and the fact that Al's first instict when I started in with the "NOT OK, NOT OK" was to grab Austen and take him out of the room so he didn't see all the blood.
</p>

<p>
I do still have a right thumb, thank god, but a chunk of skin and an even bigger chunk of fingernail are now missing from it. Sadly, I think the mandoline will be going back into its box for another three years, and I won't be making apple buckle today. On the plus side, this wound makes the horrific papercut I got on my left middle finger earlier today seem like nothing at all.

<p>
I've been trying to get a good shot of the Beaner's teeth with the 10-D, but it's difficult&#8212;he'll only display the chompers when I'm not hiding behind the camera. Today I got lucky with the cameraphone, though: A missed headshot while the Beaner was swinging resulted in a closeup of all three of his bottom teeth.

<h3 class="title">Miers Withdraws</h3>

<p>
The Democrats I heard on the radio this morning would have you believe that <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/10/my_oh_miers.html">my proposed strategy</a> of letting the right wingers duke it out over Harriet Miers' nomination worked, and that the reason she withdrew her nomination was that she wasn't able to convince the far right of her &quot;conservative credentials&quot;.  Harry Reid, for one, believes that she was eminently qualified to be a Supreme Court justice, and it was only those goofy hard-core conservatives who got in the way of her confirmation. [INSERT DOUBLE-TAKE HERE.]
</p>


<p>

Conservative senators such as Trent Lott, on the other hand, will tell you that there was no problem with Miers' views on abortion, religion, or gay rights; rather, the issue was with her experience and qualifications. [FEEL FREE TO GUFFAW LOUDLY.]
</p>
<p>
President Bush and Miers herself, after emphasizing their close personal relationship and answering questions from Senate Judiciary Committee members with, &quot;the President is a great guy!&quot; and &quot;she's a pit bull in size 6 shoes, that Harriet!&quot; would have you believe that the reason for her withdrawal was that the Democrats were hell-bent on digging into that close personal relationship, and that the only way to avoid violating both both attorney-client and Executive privilege (not to mention releasing confidential White House documents) was, regretfully, to back out now, before confirmation hearings began. [I got nothing. If George was so stupid as to believe &quot;trust me, we're friends!&quot; could take the place of a familiarity with constitutional law, a vast judicial&#8212;or at least legal&#8212;record, or participation in public debate on national issues, he's an even bigger idiot than both Reid and Lott. But then, we already knew that.]

<h3 class="title">11 Months</h3>

<p>
Austen turns 11 months old today. He took his first real steps on Friday, getting bolder with each run between the ottomans and the couch (a run that got longer each time because the babysitter kept moving the ottomans :). Sometimes he'd sort of plunge forward, and other times he'd really get the hang of walking completely upright, taking full, confident, heel-to-toe steps. It's hard to believe that this time last year, he had his head, feet, and hands all stuck underneath my ribs, and that despite his hearty thrashing, he couldn't even turn himself head-down, much less cruise around the room without me. In eleven months, Austen has gone from a tiny, grunty, swaddled little newborn to a sturdy, vocal, corduroy-wearing toddler.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="courduroy.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/courduroy.jpg" width="360" height="240" />
</p>

<p>
On Thursday he went in for another well-baby visit with the pediatrician. We never got around to determining the over/under ahead of time; instead, we just looked at each other and said &quot;how much do you think he weighs?&quot; right before we plopped His Nakedness on the scale. Al's guess was 23.5 lbs, and I threw out 24 just for variety. I wouldn't have been surprised at anything between 23 and 24.5 pounds. (He was 23 lbs. 10 oz.) For the first time, he was allowed (or able?) to sit up on the scale instead of being forced to lie down. He seemed to tolerate the weighing better this way, though the socket into which the scale was plugged was in far too convenient a spot for a sitting 11 month-old who loves power cords. (Our first disciplinary battles have been over the touching of cords and diaper pails.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, while I hadn't anticipated being able to sit Austen up on the scale, I *had* thought they might stand him up to measure him. No dice: He had to lie down, which seems like a great way to get an inaccurate measurement, if you ask me. This month's seemed more accurate than August's, however. I suspect that the August one was off because it indicated that he'd grown less than 1/2&quot; since his 5-month visit, and this one indicated that he'd grown over 3&quot; since August. My bet is that he grew about an inch between 5 months and 8 months, and about 2&quot; between 8 months and 11 months. That he'd grown some in the last month or so was definitely noticeable; when we switched to long pants (size 12-18 mo.) in September, they had to be rolled up, but by last week this was  no longer the case.
</p>
<p>
Partly because of the wonky height measurement at 8 months, and partly because Austen's much more mobile now (have I mentioned before that he's  a very proficient crawler?), his dots on the growth charts have flip-flopped: Whereas at 8 months he was in the 90th percentile for weight and the 75th (or 70th?) percentile for height, at 11 months he is in the 75th percentile for weight and the 90th percentile for height. In short, he's tall, and he's growing faster than he's gaining weight (finally).
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="crawling.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/crawling.jpg" width="359" height="240" />
</p>

<p>
 Austen is on target with all the developmental milestones, says the pediatrician, and from my own observations and others', he's happy, interactive, silly, curious, and amenable to new people and places. It's still easy to strap him into the stroller or the car seat and head out on errands or other diversions, and it's almost as easy to leave him with the babysitter for a couple hours at a time while I go out to play hockey. We even left him with the sitter for 7 hours AT NIGHT! on Wednesday when Al took me to a New Jersey Devils game for my birthday. Of course, I missed him nearly every moment of those 7 hours, but I only worried about him a little.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="lens_cap.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/lens_cap.jpg" width="360" height="240" />
</p>

<p>
I used to wonder why a stay-at-home Mom who didn't work would need a babysitter, but now I know: Without help a couple days a week, nothing would ever get done. Even though Austen naps fairly regularly, and it's easy to take him on errands, it's no longer possible to cook, bake, or clean the house without someone else watching him. He can still technically fit into the Bjorn, but it's not particularly comfortable for either of us, and cleaning or cooking with him in the backpack carrier is a bit too strenuous for me. I'll admit that cleaning and cooking weren't the main reasons I hired a babysitter at the beginning of the month&#8212;hockey was&#8212;but they're the reason I asked the sitter to come twice a week instead of just Fridays.  
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="sponge" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/sponge.jpg" width="360" height="240" />
</p>

<p>
I still struggle occasionally to get through the non-babysitter days; they're even a bit tougher than before I had help because Austen tries to make up for lost Mommy time by being clingier. You'd never know that he missed me at all when Hannah is here&#8212;they play and laugh non-stop&#8212;but as soon as she leaves he wants me to hold him all the time. He'll often wake up at 2 or 3 in the morning on Wednesdays and Saturdays (instead of his usual 5:30 or 6:30) so that he'll get some extra snuggle/nursing time in our bed. Basically, under the current arrangement both my highs and my lows are magnified: On the bad days my crankiness, my frustration, my anger, and sometimes even my despair seem overwhelming. On the good days, though, the joy is pretty limitless.

</p>
<p>
This week will be an interesting one because Hannah is away for a long weekend and won't be coming on Tuesday, and Austen and I leave Wednesday for <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~vbg/blog/" target="a8_win">Valerie</a>'s house in Maine. 
I debated for a long time about how to swing this trip, especially after getting some good advice about driving alone with a baby to Maine from my friend Shannon (&quot;DON'T DO IT!&quot;). I looked into flying, but in the end I decided to try something a little unconventional but possibly fun: I'm driving, but making frequent stops. On Wednesday we'll be driving from Philadelphia to Danbury, CT; on Thursday we'll go from Danbury to Lexington, MA (where we'll hopefully have dinner with our friends Anne &amp; Peggy); on Friday we'll head up to Portland, where we'll stay until Sunday morning; and on Sunday we'll drive from Portland down to Springfield, MA. (These legs are all designed to be between 2 and 3.5 hours, which is about Austen's range in the car.) After checking in at the hotel in Springfield, we'll make a short drive down to Hartford, CT to pick Al up at the airport, and on Monday morning the three of us will head back to Philly. This last leg is the longest, but it's also the one where I'll have help&#8212;one of us can sit in the back seat with Austen if he starts to wig out.
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="stroller_smirk.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/stroller_smirk.jpg" width="360" height="240" />
</p>
<p>
I don't think I've ever been to Portland before (I might have been as a kid, but I don't remember), so I'm looking forward to seeing it, and of course to seeing Valerie. I'm also interested to see what it's like to go on an extended trip with Austen by myself. I do worry a bit that Austen will miss Al, especially since Al now gets up with him every morning    so I can have a little extra sleep. Both of them really enjoy their morning time together; the father-son bonding has been spectacular. It's so cute when Austen wakes up/stops nursing, rolls over, sits up, and starts patting Al on the shoulder (or in the face, if the shoulder gets no response), saying &quot;Dadda! Dadda! Up!&quot;
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="on_dad.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/on_dad.jpg" width="240" height="360" />
</p>

<p>
When I get back from Maine, we'll need to buckle down and start planning Austen's first birthday party. As I've probably said many times before, first birthdays are a big deal in Korean culture, so it won't be your average kiddie party. The two things we've settled on are the date (Dec. 3 instead of the Saturday after Thanksgiving, for reasons that were obvious to everyone but us until recently) and the location (our house, because we can't find a good Korean restaurant in Philly); the rest is all up in the air. At the very least we need to figure out the food and lodging arrangements asap.

OK, before I go off rambling ad nauseam (too late!), I want to leave you with a perhaps-clich&eacute;d analogy: Parenthood really is like the Army, from the boot camp-like early days to the sometimes monotonous patrol duties to the singing of songs while marching around (I think only current parents will understand that last one). It certainly changes the way you look at and interact with the world, and it is indeed the toughest job you'll ever love.
