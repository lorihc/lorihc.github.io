<h3 class="title">New Design, Same Back End</h3>

<p>
As should be obvious, if you're reading this on the front page of the blog, I'm working on a new design. I haven't propagated it out to all the archives yet, but it'll get there eventually, and I'll probably end up fine-tuning it a bit in the process. Anyway, just seemed like time for something new.
</p>


<p>
I don't know how many people saw it, but I made a post a couple weeks ago about how I'd installed Movable Type 3.2b3. When I realized that the upgrade process had eaten all comments on <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">The Ice Hockey Escapades</a> not made by me, I quickly reverted to the backup copy of my databases and to MT3.15 (that's why the post about the beta went away&#8212;it wasn't in the backup copy of the database). Since I have several blogs in my MT installation, and I'm not sure I want to risk another glitch like the one I experienced with beta 3, I've been wary about upgrading to MT3.2 (which I believe is final now). I know that it has some really nice new features... but it also seems to be missing some things that I would use on a regular basis (like an interface for turning off comments or trackbacks on multiple entries at once), and I don't fully understand some of the changes to existing features (for example, comments used to be a three-state affair, with None, Closed, and Open options; now there's just a two-state checkbox for Allow Comments). I haven't quite gotten used to the new documentation, either, though perhaps the final version will be more usable and understandable (in the betas, the links were broken and the sample "recipes" were missing). I know I'll upgrade eventually; I'm just waffling now.

<h3 class="title">I Couldn't Agree More</h3>

<p>
From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/magazine/04QUESTIONS.html" target="a8_win">School Monitor</a>, an interview with Jonathan Kosol in today's NYT Magazine:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<em>You also suggest that our current system of locally financed schools be abolished, claiming that it perpetuates inequality by allowing suburbs like Scarsdale and Manhasset to spend twice as much on each student as less affluent cities do.</em>
</p>

<p>
Schooling should not be left to the whim or wealth of village elders. I believe that we should fund all schools in the U.S. with our national resources. All these kids are being educated to be Americans, not citizens of Minneapolis or San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
<em>Seriously, why would Republicans, who have traditionally opposed big government, encumber schools with the testing requirements attached to No Child Left Behind?</em>
</p>
<p>
The kind of testing we are doing today is <strong>sociopathic in its repetitive and punitive nature</strong>. [Emphasis added.] Its driving motive is to highlight failure in inner-city schools as dramatically as possible in order to create a ground swell of support for private vouchers or other privatizing schemes.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From <a href="http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1096516,00.html">How Bingeing Became the New College Sport</a>, an essay by Barrett Seaman in the August 29, 2005 issue of TIME Magazine:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What would happen if the drinking age was rolled back to 18 or 19? Initially, there would be a surge in binge drinking as young adults savored their newfound freedom. But over time, I predict, U.S. college students would settle into the saner approach to alcohol I saw on the one campus I visited where the legal drinking age is 18: Montreal's McGill University, which enrolls about 2,000 American undergraduates a year. Many, when they first arrive, go overboard, exploiting their ability to drink legally. But by midterms, when McGill's demanding academic standards must be met, the vast majority have put drinking into its practical place among their priorities.
</p>

<p>
A culture like that is achievable at U.S. colleges if Congress can muster the fortitude to reverse a bad policy. If lawmakers want to reduce drunk driving, they should do what the Norwegians do: throw the book at offenders no matter what their age. Meanwhile, we should let the pregamers come out of their dorm rooms so that they can learn to handle alcohol like the adults we hope and expect them to be.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="title">I Need an Editorial Calendar</h3>

<p>
I have so many things I want to blog about that there's a sort of logjam in my brain. It's kind of like how when I have a ton of things to do, I often get completely overwhelmed with the length of my To Do list and end up doing nothing. In college I combatted this tendency to become overwhelmed and just go back to bed by scheduling my days in 15-minute increments so I could see that it was technically possible to get through my To Do list in a single day. Usually I'd only get through 70-80% of it, but hey, that's better than 0%.
</p>


<p>
The blog version of the schedule in 15-minute increments would probably be an editorial calendar. I guess I have something like an editorial calendar already, in the form of keywords scribbled on hotel stationery (for example, "40 y-o virgin", "stout at Legal", "no 2T at MIT", and three pages' worth of additional notes on Austen's 9-month milestones, written when he was napping and I could find nothing in the room to read except the TV Guide) and in the little spiral notebooks I've sprinkled around the house with CAR, NIGHTSTAND, DIAPER BAG, and STROLLER scrawled in black Sharpie on their covers.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that not everything that's interesting at the time is blogworthy when I get in front of the computer, or worse, it becomes less blogworthy over time&#8212;when I procrastinate so long that the window of opportunity to write on a topic closes. What I should probably do tomorrow (ha!) is write one bullet-point post that briefly explains all the keywords I've scribbled on pieces of paper over the past two weeks, and then move on. If the next post you see here is entitled Impressed With the Breast, then you'll know that I was overcome with laziness (or overwhelmed by the length of the keyword list) and didn't do it, because Impressed With the Breast is the next topic on the editorial calendar I've been formulating in my brain as I write this.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, if you've been coming here looking for new posts and have been shocked and apalled that there haven't been any in two weeks, allow me to direct you to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/">my Flickr photostream</a>, which I've been updating with photos from our trip to Boston last week as well as other adventures (the latest three photos are what appear in the three squares on the front page of this blog); <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">the ice hockey escapades</a>, where after listening to the nagging of my teammates I finally got around to posting news from the four most recent games I played in; and <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town_II/">about town II</a>, where I've recently posted some shots taken during a family walk at sunset. Oh, and here's a recent photo of Austen, who is now "furniture surfing," as one of Al's work colleagues calls it (you can also see our new, child-friendly cube ottomans to Austen's right, which we picked up on Saturday):

<h3 class="title">Those Keys Look Tasty</h3>

<p>
Yes, I *am* going to write about all the stuff I've got jotted down on pieces of paper around the house, but I thought of something else I wanted to mention first: Austen managed to pry the Ctrl key off my laptop keyboard the other day (and of course promptly stuck it in his mouth). After 20 minutes of fiddling with it I managed to wedge it back on, but it's not quite as functional as it used to be.
</p>

<p>
I always feel a little bad when I have to reach around Austen to use the computer, and now it seems he's dexterous enough to have his revenge. I can't even read blogs&#8212;much less write in my own&#8212;when he's playing nearby anymore; I have to wait until he's down for a nap or the night. (I've tried reading/blogging while feeding him, but he gets annoyed if I don't keep the spoonfuls of food coming at a steady pace.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the Ctrl key incident inspired me to add a new item to my <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/avocado8/" target="a8_win">cafepress store</a> (betcha didn't know I even had one, did ya?):
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

</p>

<p>
It's an infant/toddler t-shirt that says "Mommy may have all the other keys, but I've got Ctrl" on the front, and "www.avocado8.com" on the back in smaller type. I've already ordered one for Austen; if you want one for your little one, they're $10 each over at

<h3 class="title">Mama</h3>

<p>
Austen called me &quot;mama&quot; yesterday. He's been saying &quot;mamamama&quot;, &quot;dadadada&quot;, and &quot;babababa&quot; for a while now, but yesterday he clearly associated &quot;mama&quot; and its variations with me. When he woke up from his nap, he called &quot;mamamama&quot; instead of crying. While playing, he'd pat my knee and say &quot;mamama&quot;. And when we were at the ice rink watching a practice last night, he leaned out of Al's arms, reached for me, and yelled &quot;MA!&quot; several times. 
</p>


<p>
I don't know if the fact that I've been trying to teach him to say, &quot;Mommy, can I please have some more food?&quot; instead of grunting angrily when he wants another spoonful of strained fruit has anything to do with the new &quot;mama&quot; talk, but I kinda suspect it does. The reason? He's been calling &quot;mama! mama! mama!&quot; every time he's ready for another spoonful this morning. [I can't wait for the Black Eyed Peas to go on Sesame Street and sing &quot;hey mama, I want some more pears and raspberries/mama! I want some more fruits and vegetables.&quot;]
</p>

<p>
I also got a spontaneous game of peekaboo out of the boopster yesterday. I was sitting on the couch, and he furniture surfed around one of my knees, ducked down, and popped up. I yelled &quot;peekaboo!&quot;, so he ducked down between my legs and popped up again. He kept doing it, varying the length of time he stayed down, and the speed with which he popped up. SO CUTE.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Backlog: Boston</h3>

<p>
 It's time to clear my backlog of scribbled-on-hotel-stationery notes, most of which pertain to our trip to Boston on the 7th. Al had a meeting there on the 8th, and we decided to make a weekend of it so Austen and his godmother could meet each other, and so the three of us could have a little family vacation. The drive there was pretty easy; Austen didn't cry at all, and we made good time despite a stop at Stew Leonard's in Norwalk, CT to see the singing milk cartons and buy bagels and snacks. (Sadly, I don't think I took any photos at Stew's.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Stout @ Legal <br />
</strong>We stayed in Kennett Square, next to MIT, the first night. By the time we got all checked in it was nearing Austen's bedtime, so we ate dinner at the nearby Legal Seafoods rather than searching for a unique Boston eating experience. (I like Legal, so I didn't mind.) On our way into the restaurant, I saw two people drinking pints of stout at a patio table and said to Al, &quot;oooh, I'm going to have one of those.&quot; So when our waiter came to take our drink orders, I said, &quot;do you have a stout on tap?&quot;, knowing that they must, but not assuming that it would be Guinness (you never know when a local brew is going to be available.) He replied, &quot;sadly, no.&quot; I looked at him for a second; surely those hadn't been pints of root beer. I know a stout when I see one. After a pause, he said, &quot;the closest thing we have to a stout is Guinness.&quot; I think I was still looking at him with that slightly puzzled, slack-jawed expression when I said, &quot;OK then, I'll have a Guinness.&quot; I'm still puzzled by this exchange, and now I'm craving a Guinness again...
</p>
<p>
<strong>No 2T at MIT/Pete's chocolate</strong><br />
On Thursday I had a chance to walk along the Charles River/Memorial Drive as well as down to Harvard Square while Al was at his meeting. The weather was warm but dry&#8212;lovely for walking, and for stopping at playgrounds to push Austen on the swings. I took a bunch of photos on the walk, including a couple that I can't bring myself to post of some hateful anti-Asian graffiti on a park bench along Memorial Drive.  I was reminded of how racially divided Boston can be, and of one of the reasons I was glad to leave back in 1984. Aside from the bench bigotry, the views along the Charles River at 9am were beautiful.

</p>
<p>
After the walk along Memorial Drive, I stopped at the MIT COOP to get Austen a t-shirt to add to his collection of college swag. Sadly, Austen will not be aspiring to MIT at this age, as they had no sizes between 12 months and 3T. (Austen's somewhere in the 12-24 months range, depending on the brand of shirt. His Stanford, Penn, and Princeton shirts are all 18 months, and they're getting snug, but the 24 month Boston Red Sox T we got him later in this trip is kinda huge.) It made me wonder whether they didn't order very many apparel items in Austen's size, or whether parents start thinking of MIT for their children when the kids are between 1 and 2 years old, leading to the store selling out of those sizes.
</p>
<p>
After a decently long nap (by Austen) at the hotel, during which I wrote a few more 9-month observations down for posterity, Austen and I departed for Harvard Square. We found a playground on Broadway and stopped to play on the swings, but we didn't stay too long as the swings were in full sun. This was probably the first time I noticed that Austen understood some of what I was saying to him: When he tried to remove his hat, I said, &quot;Austen, you have to leave your hat on if you want to play on the swings. No hat, no swing.&quot; He stopped tugging at it and left it on.
</p>
<p>
From the swings we continued on to Harvard Square, where I bought Austen two Harvard t-shirts in size 2T and something called Chocolate Caramel Knowledge for myself at the Harvard COOP. The latter turned out to be a gourmet chocolate made by the Pete of Pete's Wicked Ale, and it was DELICIOUS. Reminded me of the Kaluha truffles I used to get at the mall when I was a teenager. Well worth the $2.50 I paid for it, as the four fat discs of coffee/caramel-filled 61% chocolate will last several hours (or several weeks, if you're Al). After eating one disc of chocolate to tide me over until I could get some lunch in my stomach, I found the perfect spot to sit and enjoy an excellent spinach, goat cheese, and spiced pecan salad and a pint of Guinness while feeding Austen apples and blueberries (no high chairs available, so I fed him in the stroller). I wish I could remember the name of the place; it was on the corner of Mass Ave. and something, near the Adidas store. (The third photo below is of a different place on Mass Ave. that also serves Guinness; I thought the &quot;cheaper than gasoline&quot; sign was funny. :)

<p>
Al and I met up again after his meeting was over, checked in at our next hotel in Waltham, and then drove out to Needham (where I grew up) to meet my best friend (and Austen's godmother) for  dinner at Not Your Average Joe's. I actually found the food to be very average, but the decor was nice&#8212;much nicer than Gino's Pizza, which is what was in the space when I was a kid&#8212;and of course the company was great.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Walden Pond<br /> 
</strong> On Friday morning Al suggested we go for a walk around Walden Pond in Concord. I wasn't super into it, but I also had no real objections, so I said OK. It turned out to be really lovely and peaceful, and carrying the boopster around the 1.25-mile loop in the Bjorn was good exercise. Al was a bit disappointed to see the wire fences lining the path, which weren't there when he lived in Concord back in the 80s, but I didn't find them too distracting. I'd rather have them&#8212;and preserve the woods around the pond for future generations&#8212;than see the woods and shoreline eroded.
</p>

<p>
We saw several people kayaking, canoeing, and swimming, and passed several folks strolling and fitness walking in the woods, but we always had more than enough space to ourselves. I think an important factor in our positive, peaceful experience was that we went on a cool, cloudy Friday rather than a sunny Saturday, when the beach on the pond is often mobbed, according to Al.

<strong>Lemon Slush</strong><br />
On Saturday we took the T in to Fanueil Hall, where we had a very underwhelming fried fisherman's platter and lobster roll. We decided that since we'd been to FH and the surrounding Quincy Market several times before, and the food this time had (literally) left a bad taste in our mouths, we'd walk somewhere else. Al suggested the North End, which I think I'd only been to&#8212;or rather, through&#8212;once before, when I walked the Freedom Trail as a kid.    There we immediately found a bakery with a nutty, nougaty Italian delicacy that Al really likes, and not long after that we found the ultimate lemon slush. I am not a slush/water ice person, but this one was fantastic&#8212;exactly the right texture and flavor. I can't remember the name of the store where we got it, but it's at the corner of Salem and Parmenter Streets.

<strong>Walden Grille mussels</strong><br />
On Saturday night we cruised around the Concord area for a while, looking for a place to eat. We finally settled on the <a href="http://www.waldengrille.com/" target="a8_win">Walden Grille</a> as the only real possibility after perusing the dinner and bar menus posted outside. I thought I wanted to order off the bar menu, and Al thought he'd like something from the dinner menu, so they seated us in the bar area, in which both options were available. As it turned out, I ordered from the dinner menu, and Al ordered from the bar menu. :) I got an arugula salad with grapefruit wedges, bleu cheese, and (I think) a passion fruit vinaigrette and an order of steamed mussels. I think Al got a french dip. 
</p>
<p>
The salad presentation was a bit odd; instead of wedges, I got two huge slices of grapefuit. The taste more than made up for the basic, almost unappetizing presentation, however. Someone at the table adjacent to ours ordered the same thing I did, and she complained at first that there was no dressing for the salad. The waitress assured her that it had been tossed with the dressing in the kitchen. The patron insisted that it was missing, and asked for dressing on the side... only to discover that she had indeed been eating a dressed salad. &quot;This dressing has NO TASTE. It tastes like NOTHING,&quot; she said to her companions. Personally, I loved the light flavor and thought the salad was dressed perfectly. The passionfruit really highlighted the arugula without overwhelming it, and it didn't clash with the cheese or the grapefruit.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the mussels, the woman at the adjacent table and I heartily agreed: they were EXCELLENT. The first time I ever had mussels, at <a href="http://eastsidewest.citysearch.com/page/nyhn/Home_Page.html" target="a8_win">Eastside West</a> in San Francisco's Marina district, they defined the experience for me&#8212;and I've been chasing that perfect combination of tender, not-too-chewy, not-at-all-fishy mussel meat and savory broth ever since. Ladies and gentlemen, I found it at the Walden Grille. WG's version was different in many ways from Eastside West's, but both made me want to eat every last morsel and then soak up as much broth as possible with bread (I had to ask for an extra slice). I'm not sure if the woman at the other table was on a low-carb diet or just didn't want to fill up on bread, but I heard her ask for a spoon. Good choice, though Al's leftover batter-coated french fries also tasted amazing dipped in the tomato-y, garlicky broth. One thing you should note if you are semi-vegetarian/fishitarian, like me: The version of the mussels listed on the menu includes chorizo; I asked for mine without. I heard the woman at the adjacent table tell her companions that it was the chorizo that made the mussels so good (and it may indeed impart something special to the mix), but I can tell you that I was in as much rapture as she without it. 
</p>
<p>
So to summarize: The presentation of the dishes at Walden Grille may have been careless, but the taste and quality of the food was excellent, and the service was fast. There was no baby seat for Austen, but neither were there any complaints when he made a total mess. Oh! And the prices were very reasonable. Give it a try.

<h3 class="title">Ten Things</h3>

<ol start="1">
<li style="padding-bottom:0px">Last night I dreamed that time rewound somehow, and I was watching the 9/11 attacks again&#8212;this time from my window rather than on a hotel television. &quot;Look,&quot; I said to Al, &quot;the Towers are still standing...and there's only one smoking hole.&quot; I checked my watch. &quot;That second plane should be coming just...about...NOW.&quot; And sure enough, in it came. It was just as horrifying the second time, when I knew it was coming.</li>
</ol>


<ol start="2">
<li>Today is one of those windy days where trash cyclones pop up in the alleys and side streets, and you end up with little bits of paper bag and Jelly Krimpet wrappers stuck in your hair.  </li>
<li>Today's wind is a life-sucking, demoralizing wind, rather than an uplifting, decaffeinating wind. I fear I will be stuck indoors all day.</li>
<li>I used to think the word <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=scatological" target="a8_win">scatological</a> meant &quot;random&quot;, &quot;nonsensical&quot;,  or &quot;all over the map&quot;, and that it was related to  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scat_singing" target="a8_win">scat</a>, the kind of singing Cab Calloway and Ella Fitzgerald used to do. (I probably also had a mental association with the word <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=scattered&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">scattered</a>, which has a different etymology.) <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/tritone/" target="a8_win">nj</a> set me straight back in 1998 or 1999. </li>
<li>Austen has been asleep for an hour and forty-five minutes so far. Thank you, Austen.</li>
<li>I can be totally non-functional if I don't get the breakfast I am craving. This morning, I had to have cheese blintzes. HAD TO.</li>
<li>Despite the wind (and now the rain), I am desperate to get outside and go for a walk today. At the same time, I'm not sure I have the mental or physical energy to make it more than two blocks.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/ratphooey/" target="a8_win">Ratphooey</a> spoke for me (as she so often does) last week when she said that she wasn't ready for people to start dying on her. I've been thinking about this a lot lately&#8212;how for the next forty or fifty years, people I know and love will be dying with shocking regularity.  I have been especially worried lately that my parents will die, though neither of them is  old or in poor health.</li>
<li>I am seriously stressing out about planning Austen's <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2003/07/henrys_first_bi.html">first birthday</a> party in November.</li>
<li>I owe Josie an e-mail. Sorry, Josie! </li>

<p>
Suddenly the somber mood of my previous post makes sense: I've got a migraine coming on.

<h3 class="title">Bottom Feeder</h3>

<p>
So Derek had an <a href="http://www.powazek.com/2005/09/000540.html" target="a8_win">interesting post</a> on his site recently about the importance of putting something at the bottom of your pages to reward those dedicated souls who actually read all the way down. I hadn't thought specifically of adding the kind of bottom navigation/highlights section that Derek does, but I did give some consideration to those who read down when I redesigned my site recently. It's why the archives are listed near the bottom of the sidebar (so when you're done reading the most recent entries, you can explore the older ones if you want), and why I've always had previous and next navigation at the bottom as well as the top of my archive pages. Derek's really onto something, though, when he talks in terms of <em>rewarding</em> dedicated readers rather than punishing them. It makes me want to add more goodies down below.
</p>

<p>
On a related note... Ever heard the expression "above the fold"? Of course you have&#8212;and you don't even have to be a newspaper journalist to know what it means. The term is used all the time in web design circles, even though there's no "fold" on a web page. Conventional wisdom says that if you want a site visitor to see something, it has to be "above the fold"&#8212;or visible in the browser window at the default size. (Whether this is 600 pixels high, 724 pixels high, or more is up for debate.) Common sense will tell you, however, that if something worth reading starts above the fold and then continues below it, the reader will scroll down.
</p>

<p>
Stats bear this out, too. A colleague of my husband's told him recently that at his last company, all the research they did on clickthroughs showed virtually no difference between items placed above the fold and those placed below. Even folks who don't follow the text of an article below the fold are willing to scroll to find what they're looking for.
</p>

<p>
My blogging time is limited these days, so I don't have an opportunity at the moment to explore these ideas further, but allow me to summarize: At the very least, it's a good idea to give people who scroll down the same navigation options you give people who don't. And if you can, give those dedicated readers/explorers even more: ways to dig deeper, to explore further, to get somewhere worth going.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Perfect Ten</h3>

<p>
So yesterday it was <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/09/ten_things.html">Ten Things</a>, and today it's ten months: Austen turns ten months old today. Such a sweet kid he is, too. He's gotten really good at going to bed in the past month; I nurse him for a little while, and whether he falls asleep with the nipple in his mouth or ends the session by rolling onto his hands and knees and giving me a big grin, he knows that when I pick him up and carry him up to his room, it's bedtime. (He also probably knows by me saying, &quot;it's bedtime, boo&quot;, but more on that in a minute.) I hold him for a minute or two, give him a snuggle, tell him that I love him, and put him down. Al then covers him up with the blanket, I raise the crib rail,  we tell him we'll see him in the morning, and that's it. He's down for 8 or 9 hours at least. At most there's a small whimper.
</p>

<p class="pictureP"><img src="/blog/images/parenthood/hands_on_knees.jpg" alt="hands on knees" width="360" height="240" /></p>
<p>
I mentioned in the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/09/backlog_boston.html">Boston post</a> that Austen seemed to understand me when I told him that he had to leave his hat on if he wanted to stay on the swings, and now I'm certain that he's understanding at least some of the things I'm telling him. Today he sat down hard on the floor and bonked his head on the couch, and it couldn't have hurt that much&#8212;the couch is soft&#8212;but I think it startled him. He started to cry when neither Al nor I picked him up immediately, and then he positively screamed when it was Al who reached for him instead of me. When he started to go into hysterics, I motioned for Al to hand him over, and I sat him on my lap facing me and let him put his head on my shoulder. He huh-huh-huh-waaaaaaaaaaaaahed for a little while with me murmuring in his ear, &quot;it's OK, sweetie. You're fine, mommy's here&quot; (and whispering to Al that this was more of a mind-running-through-all-the-horrible-things-that-<em>could</em>-have-happened cry than an I'm-hurt cry). I then sat him up and tried to get him to make eye contact with me, and when he continued to cry, I said, &quot;do you want a drink of water? Would that make it better?&quot; He immediately looked toward the water bottle lying on the couch, and then he reached for it. See? The kid was paying attention. I gave him some water, and the episode was over. He also knows the word &quot;peekaboo&quot; for sure, and will duck behind my leg, my laptop, or a towel to play, popping up at varying intervals to try to surprise me or Al.</p>
<p class="pictureP"><img src="/blog/images/parenthood/peekaboo.jpg" alt="peekaboo!" width="360" height="240" /> </p>
<p>
Austen is seriously making strides in the walking department. (Oops, yes, I guess that's a pun.) He's furniture surfing with gusto now, boldly walking the length of the couch, circling the child-friendly cube ottomans, and looping the cherry side table to try to squeeze between the couch and the window. This morning he pushed the lightweight leather ottoman (which we usually use as a shoe-donning station) around the kitchen while holding a wooden salad spoon in one hand. In fact, he often has something in one hand these days; he'll find something interesting and hang onto it for hours. Today it was the wooden spoon, then a Sharpie, and then a set of chopsticks from the Han Ah Reum (which he refused to let go of even when we put him in the tub); yesterday it was the X-10 remote that Al donated to his toybox; the day before that, it was my old hairbrush; and the day before that it was a set of baby nail clippers. I'm not sure whether the precious object fascination has anything to do with him no longer insisting that we hold both of his hands before he'll take a step, but he's definitely (a) not releasing the precious object, and (b) not waiting for us to grab both hands before he takes off. He tends to overthink the stepping motion a bit when getting an assist from only one side, causing him to move more sideways than  forward; I know it's more of a mental problem than a physical one because I've seen him just do it&#8212;walk normally&#8212;when his attention is focused on something other than his feet.</p>
<p class="pictureP"><img src="/blog/images/parenthood/cruising.jpg" alt="cruising" width="240" height="360" /><br />

  <img src="/blog/images/parenthood/walking.jpg" alt="walking" width="240" height="360" /></p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Austen is also getting more mobile when he's not on his feet. He's not crawling yet; though he often gets on all fours and wiggles a lot, he doesn't go anywhere from that position. Instead, he'll either roll onto one hip and scootch forward using one arm and one foot, or he'll roll onto his belly and wriggle backwards. He can get really far either way, as well as by ooching forward on his butt (i.e., by using his heels to drag his butt forward).</p>

<p class="pictureP"><img src="/blog/images/parenthood/all_fours.jpg" alt="all fours" width="360" height="240" /><img src="/blog/images/parenthood/up_on_belly.jpg" alt="up on belly" width="360" height="240" /></p>
<p>
On the same day Austen clearly said &quot;Mama&quot; for the first time, I also thought I heard him say &quot;up-pa&quot; when he wanted to be picked up. I wasn't sure, though, especially since I couldn't remember ever saying &quot;up&quot; to him when I  picked him up. When he said it again the next day, however, I started paying attention to what Al and I were saying so I could figure out where he'd gotten it. It turns out that I do ask him, &quot;do you want to be picked up?&quot; quite a bit, so that's probably where the association came from. In any case, he knows &quot;up&quot; now. I think I also heard him say &quot;Papi&quot; when David Ortiz came up to bat in the bottom of the first inning tonight, but I can't be sure. I'll have to test that theory tomorrow afternoon. ;)</p>
<p class="pictureP"><img src="/blog/images/parenthood/watching_sox.jpg" alt="watching the sox" width="360" height="240" /></p>
<p>
One of Austen's bottom teeth has pushed its way up past the gumline, and its partner is now just breaking the surface as well. Meanwhile, the canine that started the teething bonanza is also sticking up/out, and once in a while, when Austen tilts his head while eating, we can see the top two teeth working their way down. The overall impression when you look at his mouth is that there are teeth, plural, even though it's really only the one sticking up significantly.</p>
<p class="pictureP"><img src="/blog/images/parenthood/teeth.jpg" alt="teeth!" width="360" height="240" /></p>

This has been my first  month of full-time stay-at-home momhood since Austen was three months old, and it's been an adjustment. Today I'm feeling fairly positive about my mothering abilities, perhaps because Al took vacation and was around the house most of the day (except when he went out to play pickup hockey), but there are days I feel like a completely crap mother&#8212;especially when I can't actively play with Austen all the time like the babysitter did.  
 I find I need to break up my week somehow, or I'll go bonkers. In the past couple weeks I've driven down to Maryland to visit my parents for a couple days mid-week, and to visit our friend Allison and her new 6 week-old, Nora, on a Thursday. (It helps to know that Allison was desperate to see us as we were to see her. :) I also met in person here in Philadelphia a woman I met online through this blog on a day when we both desperately needed some adult interaction.</p>

When I can't think of anywhere to go (or I can't justify wasting gasoline just to save my sanity), Austen and I walk to Schuylkill River Park, our new favorite place to play on the swings. I like it better than the park at 23rd and the Parkway partly because the walk there isn't uphill, partly because there's rarely a line for the baby swings (despite there being only two), partly because the walk there is longer and more peaceful, and partly because the park is big enough not to feel crowded even when the dog runs, the basketball courts, the open grassy areas, and the playground equipment are all occupied. Austen is starting to get into the toddler climbing gym as well as the swings, and he gets really excited when other children get on the gym with him. He really wants to play.</p>

We're still using the Bjorn occasionally, but it's more rare now. I mostly either carry Austen in my arms or use the stroller, though I did buy a Kelty Kids hiking backpack at REI this month. (I was mostly inspired to do this by our walk around Walden Pond; I'd like to go on other hikes with Austen and be able to see my feet.) So far I've only used the backpack once, when I needed to vacuum the house this week and didn't have anywhere else to put Austen while doing it. (The Exersaucer was retired last month; Austen's gotten too tall for it, but more importantly, he started to see it as a confining device rather than a source of freedom as he once did.) I found it quite strenuous to crouch down to suck up Cheerios and other debris in the kitchen and dining room, but other than that, the backpack worked like a charm. Austen just sat up there playing with the baby nail clippers, and he only pulled my hair once or twice.
