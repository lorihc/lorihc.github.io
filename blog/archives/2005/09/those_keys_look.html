<h3 class="title">Those Keys Look Tasty</h3>

<p>
Yes, I *am* going to write about all the stuff I've got jotted down on pieces of paper around the house, but I thought of something else I wanted to mention first: Austen managed to pry the Ctrl key off my laptop keyboard the other day (and of course promptly stuck it in his mouth). After 20 minutes of fiddling with it I managed to wedge it back on, but it's not quite as functional as it used to be.
</p>
<p>
I always feel a little bad when I have to reach around Austen to use the computer, and now it seems he's dexterous enough to have his revenge. I can't even read blogs&#8212;much less write in my own&#8212;when he's playing nearby anymore; I have to wait until he's down for a nap or the night. (I've tried reading/blogging while feeding him, but he gets annoyed if I don't keep the spoonfuls of food coming at a steady pace.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the Ctrl key incident inspired me to add a new item to my <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/avocado8/" target="a8_win">cafepress store</a> (betcha didn't know I even had one, did ya?):

</p>

<p>
It's an infant/toddler t-shirt that says "Mommy may have all the other keys, but I've got Ctrl" on the front, and "www.avocado8.com" on the back in smaller type. I've already ordered one for Austen; if you want one for your little one, they're $10 each over at
