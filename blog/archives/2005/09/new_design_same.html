<p>
As should be obvious, if you're reading this on the front page of the blog, I'm working on a new design. I haven't propagated it out to all the archives yet, but it'll get there eventually, and I'll probably end up fine-tuning it a bit in the process. Anyway, just seemed like time for something new.

I don't know how many people saw it, but I made a post a couple weeks ago about how I'd installed Movable Type 3.2b3. When I realized that the upgrade process had eaten all comments on <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">The Ice Hockey Escapades</a> not made by me, I quickly reverted to the backup copy of my databases and to MT3.15 (that's why the post about the beta went away&#8212;it wasn't in the backup copy of the database). Since I have several blogs in my MT installation, and I'm not sure I want to risk another glitch like the one I experienced with beta 3, I've been wary about upgrading to MT3.2 (which I believe is final now). I know that it has some really nice new features... but it also seems to be missing some things that I would use on a regular basis (like an interface for turning off comments or trackbacks on multiple entries at once), and I don't fully understand some of the changes to existing features (for example, comments used to be a three-state affair, with None, Closed, and Open options; now there's just a two-state checkbox for Allow Comments). I haven't quite gotten used to the new documentation, either, though perhaps the final version will be more usable and understandable (in the betas, the links were broken and the sample "recipes" were missing). I know I'll upgrade eventually; I'm just waffling now.
