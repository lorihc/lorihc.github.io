<h3 class="title">Mama</h3>

<p>
Austen called me &quot;mama&quot; yesterday. He's been saying &quot;mamamama&quot;, &quot;dadadada&quot;, and &quot;babababa&quot; for a while now, but yesterday he clearly associated &quot;mama&quot; and its variations with me. When he woke up from his nap, he called &quot;mamamama&quot; instead of crying. While playing, he'd pat my knee and say &quot;mamama&quot;. And when we were at the ice rink watching a practice last night, he leaned out of Al's arms, reached for me, and yelled &quot;MA!&quot; several times. 
</p>

<p>
I don't know if the fact that I've been trying to teach him to say, &quot;Mommy, can I please have some more food?&quot; instead of grunting angrily when he wants another spoonful of strained fruit has anything to do with the new &quot;mama&quot; talk, but I kinda suspect it does. The reason? He's been calling &quot;mama! mama! mama!&quot; every time he's ready for another spoonful this morning. [I can't wait for the Black Eyed Peas to go on Sesame Street and sing &quot;hey mama, I want some more pears and raspberries/mama! I want some more fruits and vegetables.&quot;]
</p>

<p>
I also got a spontaneous game of peekaboo out of the boopster yesterday. I was sitting on the couch, and he furniture surfed around one of my knees, ducked down, and popped up. I yelled &quot;peekaboo!&quot;, so he ducked down between my legs and popped up again. He kept doing it, varying the length of time he stayed down, and the speed with which he popped up. SO CUTE.
