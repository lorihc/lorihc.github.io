<h3 class="title">This Boops Was Made for Walking</h3>

<p>
In three weeks, Austen has gone from three or four steps in a row to a walking MACHINE. He crosses rooms with confidence and without a specific destination in mind, swerves around obstacles, carries precious objects with him, and is unfazed when he trips. I could sit and watch him run circles around the living room all day.
</p>

 It's particularly endearing (and amusing) to watch him amble around in just a onesie or just a diaper, with his sturdy, chubby legs poking out and his butt doing a little Nancy Sinatra waggle as he approaches the intriguing contents of a closet. (I don't have any photos of this scenario at the moment, so you'll have to take my word for its cuteness.)
</p>

<p>
At the moment Austen is careening around the living room, tripping over his own feet, pieces of string, and more substantial obstacles like bits of alumninum foil. I failed in my attempt to get him down for a nap an hour ago, when he gave every sign that he desperately needed one, which means he is now acting like a stumbling drunk. He's really too tired to stay on his feet, and yet he persists. I know I should pick him up and try again to get him to nap, but it's just so damn funny to see him wobbling around, bouncing off the furniture.

<p>Good for Austen!  Tripping over pieces of string is the funniest thing I've heard all week.  :)</p>

<p>Lucy isn't quite there yet - she will cruise along the couches and coffee table with ease and is even getting brave enough to take a full step (more of a crazed head-first lunge, really) to transfer from one object to the other.  Months ago, before she was crawling even, I bet my wife that she would be walking by Christmas.  For a while, I thought it was in the bag, but now I'm not so sure...</p>

<p>I remember the crazed head-first lunges -- they preceeded the full-fledged walking by about a month, I think. There's hope for your Christmas bet yet!</p>
