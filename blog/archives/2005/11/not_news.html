Arrrrrrrrrrgggggh! Why is the fact that Rumsfeld is spouting <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5013078" target="a8_win">Bush administration talking points</a> NEWS? Just because Rumsfeld says the same thing Bush said yesterday (or last week) doesn't make it news. Or true, for that matter.

<p>News people are no longer allowed to use judgment about what's newsworthy or true, they have to report it if the person saying it says it's newsworthy and true, otherwise they are Biased Liburl Media.  The Rove administration doubled this effect by severely restricting access and press conferences, so when they haul out a shined up Rumsfeld or Cheney or (on rare occasions) Bush, it must be News, especially if they take questions (whether or not the questions are pre-scripted.)  Bleh.</p>

<p>Also explain to me how Ahmed Chalabi, convicted embezzler, conveyor of false information, whisperer of secrets to Iran, received the grand tour recently.  He met with everyone in DC INCLUDING CHENEY, for heaven's sake.</p>

<p>It really is disgusting, isn't it? I try not to walk around indignant all the time (because I'd never be  happy otherwise, and I'd end up making Ann Coulter and my brother-in-law entirely *too* happy) but some of the "news" that ends up on NPR's hourly news summary makes me want to SCREAM. (And as Shani alluded to, the real news that doesn't is just as scandalous.)</p>
