<p>
I still have some half-written entries to publish to the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/halloween/">all hallow's eve</a> blog, which by and large was not a great success this year. Between the mobs of kids who all came together and having a hungry toddler in a shark suit to manage, I had a hard time keeping track of the parade of costumes, the candy choices, and the funny kid quotes.

<p>Austen would have been a hit at last night's Shark's game! Too cute! </p>

<p>As to fantasy football, it would have helped if I'd noticed that 4 players had a bye last week. Release at work..that's my excuse and I'm stickin' to it. lol</p>
