<h3 class="title">Apparently I'm Showing My Age</h3>

<p>
Austen and I went to watch Al's hockey game at the University of Pennsylvania's Class of 1923 Ice Rink tonight. Toward the end of the game, Austen started melting down, so I put him in the stroller and walked him around outside for a bit. I'd just come back in and was standing by the glass near the entrance when I noticed a woman in the stands above me... holding a large bar of one of my favorite kinds of chocolate. "You came prepared, I see," said I. She smiled and said, "is one of your kids playing?"
</p>

<p>
I was so startled I wasn't sure I'd heard her correctly at first. Then I did the math in my head, and I decided that though it was <em>theoretically</em> possible that I could be the mother of one of the guys on the ice&#8212;most of whom were students at Drexel or Penn&#8212;it wasn't very likely (and certainly not if you knew me). "Um, no," I replied. "My husband is."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," replied the woman, who seemed neither embarrassed nor that much younger than I. In fact, I would have said that we were "about the same age," though now that I think of it, she was probably in her early twenties. I guess, technically, I could have been *her* mom. Wow.
