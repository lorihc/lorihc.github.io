<h3 class="title">It's Cold, So Please Touch</h3>

<p>
Today, as it was yesterday, it is cold here in Philadelphia. On Tuesday (which was decidedly warm) I had taken my bicycle in to Trophy Bikes on Walnut to get a baby seat installed on the back, knowing full well that doing so would cause a cold snap that would mean the end of bicycling season. Ah well, at least I'll be ready for spring.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, having taken Austen out in the frigid weather yesterday, I knew it was really too cold for him to be out at the playground with the babysitter today. We were discussing possible indoor activities this morning when it occurred to me that Austen is now probably old enough to enjoy the <a href="http://www.pleasetouchmuseum.org/" target="a8_win">Please Touch Museum</a>, which is currently located 1 1/2 blocks from our house. (It's moving down near the Art Museum at some unspecified point in the future.) I figured that if an annual membership were $100 or so, it'd probably be worth it.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that a membership for 4 people (any four people over 12 months of age) is only $75 a year&#8212;a total bargain, IMHO. We walked over there together, I filled out an application, and viol&aacute;, Austen and Hannah had an indoor acitivity. I can't wait to hear how he liked it, and to visit with Al on a weekend. Woo hoo!

<p>Please Touch is moving to <a href="">Memorial Hall</a>, but not for a couple of years yet, so you've got plenty of time to enjoy it right around the corner.</p>

<p>Yeah, I knew about the new location, but didn't know the timeframe. I'm not sure whether to be happy or sad that it's a couple years off -- I like the proximity of the current location, but I'm excited about the larger space and new exhibits at Memorial Hall!</p>
