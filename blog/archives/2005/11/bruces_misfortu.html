<h3 class="title">Bruce's Misfortune</h3>

<P>
My favorite song by far on Mike Doughty's CD Haughty Melodic is the last track, Your Misfortune. It caught me by surprise in the car just now, however, in that it summed up so neatly and so beautifully the sentiments my sister,  my parents, and to a lesser extent I have been expressing to my Uncle Bruce for months (or years, really). It goes like this:
</p> 
<P>
When your faith in life is gone<br/>
Come and speak to me<br/>
When you're down and all messed up<br/>
Seek my sympathy<br/>
When everybody says "no, no, no"<br/>
Well it's your misfortune and none of my own<br/>
"Wrong, wrong, wrong"<br/>
Well it's your misfortune that sweetens my song<br/>
<br/>

I can be the friend you want<br/>
I can be your confidant<br/>
I can be the right reminder at the right time<br/>
Throwing out the lifeline<br/>
<br/>

Stand in the light stand in the light stand in the light<br/>
Stand in the light stand in the light stand in the light<br/>
<br/>

When your face is caked with mud<br/>
Come and speak to me<br/>
When the chill creeps in your blood<br/>
Seek my sympathy<br/>
When everybody says "no, no, no"<br/>
Well it's your misfortune and none of my own<br/>
"Wrong, wrong, wrong"<br/>
Well it's your misfortune that sweetens my song<br/>
<br/>

I can be the air you drink<br/>
Every single thought you think<br/>
I can be the right notion at the right time<br/>
Warm you like the sunshine<br/>
<br/>

Stand in the light stand in the light stand in the light<br/>
Stand in the light stand in the light stand in the light<br/>
Stand in the light stand in the light stand in the light. 
</p>

<P>
If Bruce failed to take the advice in the verses, I hope at least he is now standing in the light, free from worry and especially from pain.

<p>Poor Bruce.</p>

<p>That might be my favorite song of Mike's, ever, and that's saying a lot, since I've know him since 1986 (we went to college together).</p>

<p>I can listen to it over and over without ever getting tired of it, and the line "warm you like the sunshine" can make my throat catch even when I've been singing the song all day. </p>

<p>My mom reported (via my sister) that she was at Bruce's house yesterday cleaning up, and there was a feeling of joy around the place rather than sadness. Makes the song all the more appropriate, I think. I suspect Bruce really did find release, and that he's now standing the light.</p>
