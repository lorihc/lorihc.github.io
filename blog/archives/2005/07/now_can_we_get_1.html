<h3 class="title">NOW Can We Get a Stop Sign?</h3>

<p>
Most cars approaching 21st Street on Cherry do one of two things: (1) Assume that the cross traffic also has a Stop sign, pause, and go; or (2) Actually stop, wait for the slightest opening in the cross traffic, and then gun it across the intersection. This car apparently chose option #1. Click the photo to see a slideshow of the aftermath on Flickr.

</p>

<p>
Incidentally, while cars choosing option #1 do more damage to themselves, the cars they broadside, and the cars parked along 21st Street, as a pedestrian with stroller who must cross Cherry, it's the cars choosing option #2 that I fear most.

<p>We used to live at this corner and saw tons of accidents. Our theory was that cars on Cherry St. didn't see the stop sign because of all the signage in front of it - no parking signs, etc. </p>

<p>Alas, the link to the online form for "reporting a hazardous highway condition" on phila.gov is broken, but you could just e-mail them:  <a href="http://www.phila.gov/streets/contact_us.html">http://www.phila.gov/streets/contact_us.html</a></p>

<p>Of course, we have a stop sign at our intersection, but people all but ignore it.  We need to upgrade to a stoplight.</p>

<p>Already done. It's the reason I took photos yesterday -- I wanted to show the Strees Department and our City Councilman the damage that is done by their lack of action.</p>

<p>Renita: This was Al's theory as well -- that the silver car ran the stop sign entirely. He figures it's the only way it could have gotten up enough speed to hit the Jeep as hard as it did. While I suspect that flooring it (as so many people do in an effort to zip across the intersection) could have produced the same result, I'll defer to Al's superior knowledge of physics on this one and say that he (and you) are probably right.</p>
