Greetings from the Internet Lounge at Flash Forward in NYC. Al is giving a presentation in about an hour, and the plan was for me to visit my favorite New York spots while he got ready. I'd watch the preso (if Austen cooperated), and then we'd all go up to his brother's apartment in the evening and spend the weekend. The plan did not include rain.

Rain, however, is what NYC is getting right now, in torrents. Oops, and poop is what Austen's delivering right now... hopefully not in torrents. Back after a diaper change.
