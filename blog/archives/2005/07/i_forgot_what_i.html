<h3 class="title">I Forgot What I Was Going to Say</h3>

<p>
Last night I thought of like five different things I wanted to blog about (some parenthood-related, some politics/media/news-related), but I figured rather than trying to type while holding the baby, I'd wait until I had both hands free today to blog. Of course, now I can't remember what I was going to say....
</p>

<p>
Random results of the Google search I'm running on my brain in the background:
</p>

<ul>
<li>We found a new babysitter on Friday, and she started today. So far, so good.</li>
<li>The alarm system went off in the house at 10:40pm on Friday (when we were in Baltimore) and caused a bit of a panic on our part. The police still hadn't responded 40 minutes after the alarm company notified them, so we asked an amazingly understanding neighbor to have a peek at the house for us. She reported that no windows were broken and house looked intact, and also mentioned that there'd been a hellacious thunderstorm at 10:40, which is probably what tripped the alarm. Phew.</li>
<li>Live 8: Glad we were gone. Was the TV coverage as bad for Live Aid? Al and I seem to recall that it was...</li>
<li>We're being jerked around by Sears again, this time for the dryer. We had a repair appointment for 8am-12pm on Friday; when the guy hadn't called or shown up by 1:15, we left for Baltimore. He called my cell phone at 2:20pm to say he was ready to come over. I said too late, we'd left when he was only an hour late. He said that 8am-12pm really means 8am-5pm. Me: "Really? Then why tell me 8am to 12pm?" Him: "I'm just telling you the company policy, m'am. I can come back on Tuesday, 8am-12pm." Me: "Which means you'll be there by 5pm?" When he hadn't turned up by 2pm yesterday I called to find out when he was coming; turns out that he meant NEXT Tuesday, not this one. Fucker. And by the way, this is the same dryer that Nick, the old repair guy, "fixed" back in October.</li>
<li>Sandra Day O'Connor. Hmmmm. I'm not sure I was totally on board with her case-by-case ruling style, but I'm glad she had the opportunity to serve. I'm curious to see who makes it through next... and I think I'll opt out of the partisan rhetoric (nay, hyperbole) this time around. One thing I will say: How about keeping to the spirit of one of O'Connor's rulings and using race and gender as only one factor among many when choosing a new justice?</li>
<li>I'm looking forward to Austen's next doctor visit at the end of this month. As of right now, the over/under is looking like 23 lbs. As usual, I'm going under.</li>
<li>Foods Austen has tried so far: sweet potatoes, peaches, plums, prunes, rice, rice cereal, bananas, avocado, apples, applesauce, watermelon, and organic vanilla-flavored teething biscuits. And paper, of course. Lots of paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>What did Austen think of the sweet potatoes?  They were the first vegetable that our Lucy tried and they made her pretty gassy and uncomfortable for a weekend.  She has reacted to squash, peas, and carrots much better so far.  Is it worth trying the sweet potatoes again in a couple of weeks?</p>

<p>I think sweet potato was one of the first two foods we tried (the other was avocado). He seemed to like them fine, and over the past couple weeks as he's gotten more used to solids in general, sweet potatoes have become one of his favorites. I haven't noticed that any foods have made him particularly gassy, though last week when my mom was here he was constipated for the first time. I think it was because she was feeding him about three times as many solids as I usually do (and consequently, he was getting a lower percentage of breast milk). Constipation isn't much of a problem no matter which kinds of solids he eats as long as I give him a little water with each meal and nurse him at least 3 or 4 times a day. As to whether it's worth trying the sweet potato again, I'd give it a whirl (with the caveat that every kid is different, of course). I've noticed that foods Austen loves one week he'll turn his nose up at the next, and vice versa, so everything's worth a second try.</p>

<p>How old is Lucy now, 5 months? Do you have any photos posted? :)</p>

<p>hi Lori</p>

<p>Are you serious that Austen is near 23 pounds, you're kidding right? Cate is maybe just nearing that mark at 17 months.</p>

<p>Nope, I'm not kidding. He was 20 lbs. 2 oz. at his 5-month checkup, and I'm guessing he's about 21.5 - 22 lbs. now. Al thinks he's more than that, which is why the over/under is 23. :) Austen's appointment is on the 29th -- I'll be sure to post the results of his weigh-in on the blog!</p>

<p>Re: grits&#8212;I hadn't thought of trying grits. I'll see if I can find some organic ones at Whole Foods. :)</p>
