<h3 class="title">This Week...</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Our babysitter (whom the Beaner and I really, really like) was on vacation.</li>
  <li>Our Mac Mini had a serious hard drive error that prevented it from starting up, that required a three-hour visit to the Apple store just to get most of the data backed up, and that required a complete reformat of the hard drive. Luckily, almost all of the photos I've taken over the past 8 months were salvaged, as was all the iTunes music. We'll be backing up more regularly now, of course.</li>
  <li>The Beaner  fell out of our bed when a midday phone call from a fucking telemarketer woke him from a nap. He has a bruise on his elbow and his hand, but otherwise he's fine. </li>
  <li>We are trying to establish a new nap routine (Pack 'n Play or crib only, not our bed), and the angst involved is really wearing me (and the Beaner, I imagine) down. </li>
  <li>The Beaner has screamed so loudly and piercingly that my ears have shut down several times. It's like going momentarily deaf.</li>
  <li>I had a migraine.</li>
  <li>We ran out of Advil. (Not that it really helps anyway.) </li>
  <li> I won the over/under. At today's 8-month doctor visit, Austen was 22 lbs., 7 oz. </li>
</ul>

<p>I think you should go here to get some gelato to recover from the hard drive error and nap angst - <a href="http://www.capogirogelato.com/main.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.capogirogelato.com/main.html</a></p>

<p>Indeed, Capogiro can cure much angst. Austen's abed now, but we will try to get out for a small duo of bittersweet chocolate and whatever wonderful fruit they have this weekend!</p>
