<h3 class="title">Failed Experiment #52, Makeup Edition</h3>

<p>
Since I regularly mix a bit of foundation with my moisturizer, smear it on my face, and call it makeup, I was intrigued when I saw <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=139817&catid=9563&cmbProdBrandFilter=43263&trx=GFI-0-EVGR-91292&trxp1=60&trxp2=139817&trxp3=1&trxp4=5&btrx=BUY-GFI-0-EVGR-91292">Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer Tinted Moisturizer</a> on drugstore.com. I was shopping during the 20%-off-your-entire-order sale, so I bought one. Unfortunately, "Light to Neutral" turned out to be about 40 shades darker than my actual skin tone, and I didn't realize that drugstore.com guaranteed the color of makeup, so I threw out the packing <s>sleep</s> (<-Freudian sleep there, I guess) slip I'd need to return it.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, undeterred, I went to CVS last night to see if there was a lighter color of the stuff. There was; in fact, there were two shades that were lighter than the one I'd ordered. I went with the lightest, Ivory to Fair. Alas, still too dark by several shades:

</p>

<p>
Does anyone want a bottle of tinted moisturizer in Ivory to Light (10) or Light to Neutral (30), each used only once? I'd rather mail them to a reader than have a Freecycle stranger come all the way to my house for a bottle of makeup.

<h3 class="title">Failed Experiment #63</h3>

<p>
On Friday last week I was home with The Beaner, so I decided to try a day without diapers. He loved wearing underpants, and he peed every time I took him to the toilet... but he didn't quite get that he was not supposed to pee in his pants, too. After the second pair of underpants (and outer pants) got wet, he whimpered a little in discouragement. After the third pair got wet, he said, "I need a diaper." Ever since, we've been sticking with diapers&#8212;but doing our best to keep them dry with regular visits to the bathroom. He's been a total champ, and I'm hoping that the next time we try this, it won't be a <em>failed</em> experiment, but a successful one.
