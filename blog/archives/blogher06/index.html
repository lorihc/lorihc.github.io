</div>

 I still haven't made my way to the sites of all the women I met at BlogHer, partly because my blog-reading time is limited by work and family obligations, and partly because as I read each woman's site, I end up getting sidetracked by her archives and photos and links to other sites. I'm finding myself down fascinating side roads this way....

</div>

 I'd really like to be honest about my BlogHer experience, but I think it's also probably wise to be a bit circumspect. I apologize in advance if I hurt anyone's feelings with my honesty or bore anyone to death with my circumspection....

</div>

 I realized that I haven't blogged at all today, which is probably a good sign&#8212;it means that I'm actually out socializing and interacting and watching presentations rather than hiding behind my computer. This is really the first session that I've felt like I could listen partway while blogging at the same time....

</div>

 I rallied for a little bit during the Q &amp; A part of the podcast session to chat with Mrs. Kennedy about ice hockey and haircuts and our living/working arrangements, but now I'm taking a break in my room. I'm hoping that Al and Austen get back from the King of Pizza in the next 10 minutes, so I'll have time to video chat with them before going to the Design/Style/Customization session at 5:15....

 I don't know how I'm going to make it to the cocktail party. I've spoken to about a dozen women so far (I know, I know&#8212;I haven't even made a dent, given that there are about 750 women here), and I'm already running out of steam. Mrs. Kennedy is sitting here with me now, listening to the podcasting presentation, but we're both mostly blogging and having a bit of quiet time. I'm finding that I don't want to have...

</div>

 Yes, there are men here at BlogHer, and one of the first announcements of the day was that there were only two bathrooms in this building&#8212;one for men, and one for women&#8212;and that while it may occasionally be OK to guard the men's room door so a gaggle of women can avoid the line at the women's room, we can't completely commandeer the place. LET THE MEN PEE was the plea....
