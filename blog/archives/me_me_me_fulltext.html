<h3 class="title">Limbo is Not for Lori</h3>

<p>
I was talking to my mom on the phone last night about how lately I seem to be suffering from Weekend Depression, and how I haven't been looking forward to Cleaning Night as I used to (in fact, I'm dreading it these days). I speculated that the two phenomena might have something in common, since they started at around the same time, and both seem to stem from resentment of the Mountain View house. I think that now that I've given up my house in Truckee, I'm feeling a little stuck in Mountain View. I know that eventually Al & I will buy a new house together, and I'm excited about that prospect: it's why I didn't feel sad about putting my house on the market. I knew it was paving the way for something new and different and better. The problem is that I can't wait for the new, different, and better thing to come. As mom observed, "you'll take heaven or hell, but you can't stand limbo."

<h3 class="title">Why Bunny?</h3>

<p>
I chose "bunny" for today's webcam caption, and my husband just asked me why. "Bunny hair," I replied. This doesn't make much sense to anyone I say it to, but whenever I dye my hair pale pink, I refer to it as "bunny pink" or just "bunny hair." The reason is that when I was 5 (or 3? or 1?), I got a pink stuffed rabbit for Easter. Ever since, I've associated that pale pink color with bunnies, even though I've never met an actual bunny that's pale pink.
</p>

<p>
I think my mom might still have that bunny at her house, actually. If she does, I'll take a photo of it next time I'm there. It probably looks pretty sad now (though, to be honest, it looked pretty sad the last time I remember seeing it, which was about 15 years ago). Mom sewed on buttons to replace the eyes it lost over the years, and she mentioned once that its ears had stood up when she and dad bought it for me, though they drooped within a year. This was a shock to me, as I'd thought its ears had always drooped.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to remember if I'm remembering actually finding the rabbit where the Easter Bunny had hidden it (in a wicker ottoman we used to have), or whether I'm remembering the photograph of me finding it...

<h3 class="title">April Approaches</h3>

<p>
There's a lot to look forward to in April: Daylight Savings Time, a new hockey season, the Easter Bunny's arrival, warmer weather, blooming flowers.... Unfortunately, to get to all those good things, we have to enter April via its first official day, otherwise known as April Fool's Day. Oh, how I loathe April Fool's Day.
</p>

<p>
It's not so much that I don't have a sense of humor (I do, really!); it's that I don't find practical jokes particularly funny, and I don't appreciate being lied to. These seem to be the hallmarks of any successful April Fool's Day. My father seemed to look forward to April 1 every year, though specific memories of tortuous April Fool's breakfasts with him only date back to my pre-teen years, when my sister and I got up early enough for school that we would see him before he left for work. His cousin Ducky, who was in perpetual tease-the-kids-with-lies-and-practical-jokes mode, seemed to regard the day as something of a national holiday. Ducky's own kids seemed to roll with it, but I was always demanding exasperatedly that he just tell me the truth, which is probably where the rumor that I have no sense of humor started.
