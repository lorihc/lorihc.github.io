 I just wanted to say a few words about the health plan I used to have at Adobe, and you can take those words for what they're worth. I'm saying my piece here because I never hear anyone talk about this sort of thing, and I think it's relevant to the debate....

 Ugh, it's that time of year again: The time when every building and fountain in Philadephia is lit up with pink. Stores sell bears in pink t-shirts (with a whole $4.50 from your purchase going toward breast cancer charities!) and tea with pink ribbons on the cannister and pink-enameled kitchen appliances. We're urged to buy! buy! buy! in the name of breast cancer....

 Interesting article in today's NYTimes: On the Job, Nursing Mothers Find a 2-Class System. Something I'd never thought about, either while I was nursing or after. My current company has lactation rooms&#8212;I used one to nurse the Beaner in when I was visiting in March 2005&#8212;and since I worked from home part-time while I was nursing, I could nurse him with one hand while typing with the other. Luckily, I never had to pump on a daily basis....

 And by that I mean not only that it's about time the FDA approved Plan B, but also that the reason making Plan B available over the counter is so important is that it must be taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. (See What Happens When There Is No Plan B?.) It's about damn time....
