<h3 class="title">Gap Tall Has Failed Me</h3>

<p>
 I feel like Goldilocks, in search of the perfect t-shirt. WHY is it SO HARD to find something that won't leave my ass crack exposed when I sit (or my belly button exposed when I stand, for that matter) while at the same time being flattering? Is my waist so long, my tits so small, and my ass so big that there is no happy medium to be found anywhere? There has to be something between this:
</p>

</p>
<p class="pictureP">
And this:
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<img src="/blog/images/t_too_long.jpg" alt="this t-shirt is TOO LONG (it's a L from Gap Tall)" title="this t-shirt is TOO LONG (it's a L from Gap Tall)" width="400" height="599" />
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
Besides this:
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<img src="/blog/images/t_just_right.jpg" alt="this t-shirt is JUST RIGHT (but it makes me look like a 13 year-old boy)" title="this t-shirt is JUST RIGHT (but it makes me look like a 13 year-old boy)" width="399" height="599" />
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
I mean, come ON.

<p>The brown shirt isn't unflattering but it does sort of resemble something a Hollywood starlet would wear as a dress. </p>

<p>Yes, that was my impression as well -- that it *almost* worked as a dress, but not quite. You should have seen the striped one, though. Good lord, I love me some horizontal stripes, but NOT ACROSS MY ASS. </p>

<p>Old Navy's Perfect Fit Tees are extra long this season. They are longer than my Gap maternity tees (some of my tall friends use these as non-maternity tees). Don't know how flattering they are, though...</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip! I got thinking after I wrote this post that if the Talls are this long, maybe the regular-fit stuff would actually fit me. :) I will test this theory when I return these items to my local Gap store, and I will check out Old Navy, too.<br />

<p>"Is my waist so long, my tits so small, and my ass so big that there is no happy medium to be found anywhere?" - Okay, I've stopped laughing...</p>

<p>You know, I remember once in college you described yourself as having cleavage you could drive a mack truck through! Unfortunately, I don't have any suggestions for you (although I agree with Madge that Old Navy's shirts do seem to be getting longer) unless you want to start wearing those jeans that sit at your natural waist (shiver!). Let's wait for that until we're much older...</p>

<p>my daughter told me it's so uncool to have your belly showing right now. it's just, like, not done, ok? i suggest you take all of those and layer them. my daughter had on 4 shirts the other day. FOUR. and they were exquisitely layered. </p>

<p>I suspected as much, based on what the teens and twentysomethings are wearing right now, and I think it would be uncool to show *my* belly in any case. :) Layering is a good idea -- I just need to figure out how to do it effectively, especially in the heat and humidity of a Philly summer, with clothes that barely fit in *single* layers!<br />

<p>I wonder if American Apparel would have anything of the appropriate length. A lot of their stuff is thin so good for layering.</p>

<p>My only issue with American Apparel is that all their stuff runs tiny -- XLs barely fit me. I'll check out the layering possibilities next time I'm in the downtown store, tho. :)</p>

<p>I have the same problem. I usually go with #2, and hack it off with pinking shears if it really is too long. Too long is better than too short. Also, American Apparel...ha ha ha. IMHO only midgets (rich midgets!) can wear their clothes. I am stocking up on the longer Old Navy stuff.</p>
