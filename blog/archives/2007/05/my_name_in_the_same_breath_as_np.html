<h3 class="title">My Name in the Same Breath as NPR's</h3>

<p>
So a few weeks ago, when I was in San Francisco (i.e., away from my normal personal laptop with its handy mail filters), I got an e-mail from someone wanting to know if I wanted to help NPR. I deleted the message as spam without reading it. A week later, I got another e-mail with the same subject (prepended this time with Re:)... and from the same sender. This time I decided to check out the headers and <em>maybe even open it</em>.
</p>
<p>
It turned out to be a legitimate request to use one of my Flickr photos in a video piece for NPR.
</p>

<p>
<em>Wait!</em>, I know you're thinking, <em>NPR stands for National Public RADIO. That *has* to be a scam!</em> No really, it wasn't. Like everyone else, NPR has decided to dip its toes into the web video waters... and the piece they wanted the photo for was <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/bryantpark/2007/05/dont_stand_so_close_to_me.html">posted on NPR's website</a> earlier this week. My photo is in the video for about half a second&#8212;I think my credit is actually on the screen longer&#8212;but hey, it's still kinda neat.*

<p style="font-size:smaller">
* I specifically got permission from my teammates in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/426786162/in/photostream/">the photo</a> before I gave the go-ahead for the producer to use it. We all agreed that it didn't really demonstrate the "elevator effect"&#8212;everyone was looking in different directions mainly because several different conversations were going on at the same time&#8212;but we didn't see any harm in it being used in the piece, and I think we're all familiar with the phenomenon. In my experience, it's more commonly found in locker rooms at pickup games, where you're unlikely to know the other participants, than it is when you're sharing three square feet of space with a teammate you know well.
