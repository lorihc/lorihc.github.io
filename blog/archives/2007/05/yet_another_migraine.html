<h3 class="title">Yet Another Migraine</h3>

<p>
Every time I have a string of migraines, I resolve to write them down on the calendar to see if I can discern a pattern... and then I don't have one for awhile, and the resolve goes out the window. Sadly, I find myself resolving again today, as this is the third migraine I've had in the past couple months. This one, unlike the other two, is centered in my head, and is more typical of the kind I used to get before I started getting "work migraines"&#8212;the kind that are all in my neck and shoulders, and, aside from the initial blurry vision, don't impede my ability to function all that much (though they do come with wicked, week-long shoulder pain hangovers).
</p>
<p>
With this one I've gotten the severe nausea that I thought was a thing of the past (along with head-based migraines in general). Unfortunately, I'm not able to actually throw up, which would probably make me me feel better. Between that and the crushing head pain, it's a bit difficult to focus.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to figure out if the longer bout of blurry vision&#8212;which ramped up very slowly and lingered even after I'd laid down for 30 minutes after it became impossible to see&#8212;was an indicator that this would be a head migraine rather than a shoulder migraine. It's been so long since I had a head migraine that I can't remember what the preludes to those were like. All I know now is that I have about a zillion work things I should be doing, and I just want to close my eyes and vomit into a bucket. Yuck.
