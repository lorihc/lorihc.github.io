<h3 class="title">Now Back to Our Regularly Scheduled Programming</h3>

<p>
Apologies to the non-sports fans who follow <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/">my Flickr stream</a> for the barrage of lacrosse photos over the past couple days. I broke out the 70-200m f4/L and took nearly 500 shots of my nephew's game in nearby Lower Merion on Saturday. (My sister's family lives in Maryland, but my nephew plays on a travel team.) Lucky for all of us, I think, I only uploaded about half of them.
</p>
<p>
I was saying to Al that I enjoy shooting sporting events&#8212;especially kids'/teens' sporting events&#8212;for the same reason I like shooting weddings: because I'm capturing special moments, of course, but also because the subjects couldn't be more thrilled to see the results. I like making people happy by getting a good shot of them. (I also love to shoot signs, locations, decay, and other subjects, but those don't involve the positive feedback of a good people shot.)
</p>

<p>
In any case, now that I've gotten through all the LAX photos, I'll be posting some of the other photos I took this weekend: namely, ones of the Beaner playing in the park, of the tulips blooming in Logan Circle, and the usual about town-type stuff.

<p>Hey Lori, If you enjoy shooting sports events, why don't you sell prints using a photo service. I use Shutterfly. I think your service, Flickr offers the same way for people to look up a specific event and order prints also. Are you familiar with the way this works? You could pass out a business card with the address where photos will be loaded, they buy and you get paid. I think this is the way you have set up you Avocado mugs and t shirts. This is a great way to offer the teams and their families a way to have some of those great shots you get.</p>
