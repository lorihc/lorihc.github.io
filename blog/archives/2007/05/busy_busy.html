Sorry for the slim postings over here lately. I now have so much to say about the Beaner that I don't even know where to begin... and so I don't, because I don't have time to write a serial novel at the moment. Work, you know. Lots to do.
</p>
<p>
Things I could be writing about:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The Beaner's Dora/Diego obsession, and the various ways it's spilling into our lives ("Starbucks, Bus Stop, Beaner's House!", "Bridge, Gas Station, King of Pizza!")</li>
<li>Today's visit to the allergist, and the things we both tested negative for (but which we react to in daily life)</li>
<li>The "it's all about ME" mentality he seems to have these days. (No, son, it's all about ME. Haven't you heard?)</li>
<li>The ankle. Yes, it still hurts. Yes, I'm still walking around on it. Yes, I'm still icing and wrapping and elevating and taking Advil. Yes, I'm impatient&#8212;why do you ask?</li>
<li>The 5 lbs. I've gained since the injury. I seem to have underestimated the number of calories I was burning just running up and down the stairs on a daily basis, walking the Beaner to sharecare, and just going about my life at a normal pace&#8212;things I'm not doing right now.</li>
<li>How much I am positively PINING to start doing any form of exercise again (and not just because of the weight gain). I feel like a slug. (And yes, I'm doing a bit of Pilates, but it's not enough for me.)</li>
<li>The way the Beaner just sneakily poked his head out of his door to see if I had really left him in there to fall asleep alone. Totally cracked me UP.</li>
<li>The adventure we had at Wegman's the other night when I suddenly couldn't walk anymore, Al had to fetch me a Costanza Cart, and then I nearly mowed down the woman in front of me at the checkout line when the Beaner grabbed the accelerator. (Luckily, after shouting "stop! stop! stop!" a few times and thinking WHERE THE HELL IS THE BRAKE???, I managed to wrest control away from the Beaner and throw the thing in reverse.) Hoo yeah.</li>
<li>How filthy my house is, thanks to the bathroom remodel and the fact that I can't drag the vacuum up and down the stairs.</li>
<li>Oh yeah, the bathroom remodel. Fart.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oops, there's the husband. He takes precedence over both work and blogging. Gotta go.
