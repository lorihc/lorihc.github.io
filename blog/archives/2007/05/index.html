<h3 class="title">Now Back to Our Regularly Scheduled Programming</h3>

<p>
Apologies to the non-sports fans who follow <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/">my Flickr stream</a> for the barrage of lacrosse photos over the past couple days. I broke out the 70-200m f4/L and took nearly 500 shots of my nephew's game in nearby Lower Merion on Saturday. (My sister's family lives in Maryland, but my nephew plays on a travel team.) Lucky for all of us, I think, I only uploaded about half of them.
</p>

<p>
I was saying to Al that I enjoy shooting sporting events&#8212;especially kids'/teens' sporting events&#8212;for the same reason I like shooting weddings: because I'm capturing special moments, of course, but also because the subjects couldn't be more thrilled to see the results. I like making people happy by getting a good shot of them. (I also love to shoot signs, locations, decay, and other subjects, but those don't involve the positive feedback of a good people shot.)
</p>

<p>
In any case, now that I've gotten through all the LAX photos, I'll be posting some of the other photos I took this weekend: namely, ones of the Beaner playing in the park, of the tulips blooming in Logan Circle, and the usual about town-type stuff.
</p>

<h3 class="title">On Taking Two Feet for Granted</h3>

<p>
Things I wish I'd done before spraining my ankle last night at open hockey:
</p>

<ul>
<li>started priming and painting the bathroom</li>
<li>stocked my office with more snacks</li>
<li>laundry</li>
<li>oh, I don't know... moved to a house that didn't have four flights of stairs?</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Strenuous</h3>

<p>
I was a little worried that (a) my ankle wouldn't be healed in time for the Vancouver tournament, and (b) that all this sitting around would leave me out of shape even if it did heal in time. (a) is still a possibility, but I don't think (b) is. GOOD LORD, getting around on crutches and up and down our stairs is strenuous! I feel like I ate a ton of food yesterday (again, while worried about (b)), but then I realized I was eating so much not because I was bored, but because I was <em>hungry</em>. And I'm hungry because I'm blowing through whatever meager energy stores I have just getting down the hall to the bathroom and back.
</p>

<p>
This morning I took the Beaner to sharecare in a taxi because I obviously can't push a stroller on crutches, and I can't drive our car because it's a stick (working the clutch definitely requires ankle movement). I didn't make him lunch; instead, I just threw a ten dollar bill in his backpack. I also didn't make him breakfast, but that was mostly because he said, "it's OK, I don't need anything." (That kid is SO SWEET.) I said, "how about a cookie cracker or two?" He readily agreed that a couple Carr's whole wheat crackers (which are kind of sweet, hence the "cookie cracker" moniker) would be perfect, so I got him those and threw the remaining three into the backpack.
</p>

<p>
I nearly fell when I went to fill his sippy cup with Rice Dream, and he admonished me for about the 100th time to "be careful!", which is actually more cute than annoying. After that I called for the taxi, managed to get the double stroller out the front door and onto our stoop (thanks to Aura for putting it near the front door for me on her way out last night), and asked the Beaner to go down about two steps and sit, which he did. Then I got myself and my crutches out the door, locked it behind me, and sat on the steps with him.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

I have the best kid ever.
</p>

<p>
When the taxi pulled up a few minutes later, I asked the driver to put the stroller in the trunk, and then told the Beaner to go ahead and get in, which he did. He sat directly behind the driver, which I wish I'd had time to stop and take a photo of, because he looked so cute&#8212;like I was going to shut the door and wish him safe travels through the window. I asked him to scoot over so Mommy could get in, and he did. As we pulled away from the curb, he said, "this is a green taxi. I <em>like</em> green taxis!!"
</p>

</p>

<p>
In the rush to get the Beaner safely out of the taxi at M's house, I realized I'd forgotten to tell the driver we'd be continuing on to Julius Scissor at 21st and Locust (luckily only a couple blocks away), and I did *not* realize that I'd forgotten to give the Beaner his sippy cup (which I'd stashed in my purse for the ride). Oh well. I got to Julius' place about 30 minutes early, and I could <em>see</em> the Tuscany Cafe almost two blocks away on the corner of Rittenhouse Square, but I quickly calculated that there was no way I'd have time to hobble down there, drink a coffee, and get back before my appointment. Instead I sat on the steps and called my sister.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Next I got another fabulous haircut from Julius.

I will probably style it differently tomorrow after I wash it, but right now I'm digging the pompadour.
</p>

<p>
Since it was only 10:30am, I didn't have a meeting until 1pm, and COFFEE WAS IN SIGHT, I decided to try to make it to the Tuscany Cafe. And here's where we come back to the 'strenuous' theme, because boy, was that a workout! I had to stop several times to rest&#8212;and once to adjust the crutches from 5'8" to 5'9" (I think the orderly set them at 5'8" instead of the height the nurse shouted at him because he wanted to discourage me from leaning on the tops, but for this kind of trek I really required a little more support than just my hands)&#8212;but I made it, and it only took 10 minutes, not 15. Woo!
</p>

<p>
I ordered a decaf double-tall latte for here (because there was no way I could carry a coffee) and, after realizing that I'd had no breakfast, decided to blow my sugar budget on an M&amp;M brownie. It's probably a testament to how low my glycogen stores were that the brownie didn't taste very sweet at all, despite the frosting and M&amp;Ms. The coffee, meanwhile, was near perfect. Score another 9.5 for Tuscany Cafe! (Three out of four coffees I've had there have been near perfect; one was about average Starbucks level, which is still fairly good.)
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/481403324/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/188/481403324_e1ddd1fad9_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="yay" /></a><br />
Yay.
</p>

<p>
Luckily there was a taxi stand right outside the cafe, so I was able to get home easily. The next difficult task, however, was getting up our front steps (I did a combination of going up backwards on my butt and crawling forwards), assembling all the things I'd need for a long stint in my upstairs office (yogurt, cheese sticks, camera, ice pack, bandana for tying ice pack around ankle, cell phone), and then getting up two short flights of stairs and one very long one. I hopped up the first two, and then crab-crawled on my butt up the third.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

The Beaner doesn't need the baby gate, but I do: It keeps me from pitching down the stairs if I mis-navigate in my office chair (which is more efficient than crutches for getting down the hall to the bedroom).
</p>

<p>
I estimate that I burned about 800 calories this morning.

<h3 class="title">Yet Another Migraine</h3>

<p>
Every time I have a string of migraines, I resolve to write them down on the calendar to see if I can discern a pattern... and then I don't have one for awhile, and the resolve goes out the window. Sadly, I find myself resolving again today, as this is the third migraine I've had in the past couple months. This one, unlike the other two, is centered in my head, and is more typical of the kind I used to get before I started getting "work migraines"&#8212;the kind that are all in my neck and shoulders, and, aside from the initial blurry vision, don't impede my ability to function all that much (though they do come with wicked, week-long shoulder pain hangovers).
</p>

<p>
With this one I've gotten the severe nausea that I thought was a thing of the past (along with head-based migraines in general). Unfortunately, I'm not able to actually throw up, which would probably make me me feel better. Between that and the crushing head pain, it's a bit difficult to focus.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to figure out if the longer bout of blurry vision&#8212;which ramped up very slowly and lingered even after I'd laid down for 30 minutes after it became impossible to see&#8212;was an indicator that this would be a head migraine rather than a shoulder migraine. It's been so long since I had a head migraine that I can't remember what the preludes to those were like. All I know now is that I have about a zillion work things I should be doing, and I just want to close my eyes and vomit into a bucket. Yuck.

<h3 class="title">Ankle Update</h3>

<p>
Dudes, I am walking around without crutches today!
</p>

<p>
OK, it's more like limping, gimping, and shuffling around without crutches, but hey, it's a start. I have to be careful not to make any twisting motions and to avoid pivoting my ankle as much as possible (hence the shuffling rather than actual striding), and this amount of mobility is definitely underwritten by lots of ice and ibuprofen, but I just couldn't take the crutches anymore. They're TOO FUCKING SLOW, for one thing, and for another, they hurt my arms, shoulders, and hands about as much as gimping around without them hurts my ankle at this point, so I figured it was a wash.
</p>

<p>
Which reminds me, it's time for another 600mg of ibu.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Black and Blue (and Purple and Green)</h3>

<p>
So as the caption on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/485710803/">this photo</a> explains, the ankle was painful enough on Saturday morning that I returned to crutches for the weekend. I think this was a good choice in any case, because we went down to visit my in-laws, and it's hard to imagine getting around their giant house&#8212;not to mention the stores, driveways, sidewalks, restaurants, and parking lots I had to navigate&#8212;with a bandaged-and-besocked foot sans crutches.
</p>

<p>
Once I got back in my own house on Sunday night, of course, I abandoned the crutches again and returned to hobbling. It's too much of a pain in the arse to drag the crutches up and down the stairs, and 90 degree angles aren't hard to manage. It's the 45s that are the big problem&#8212;something I already knew, but which was driven home for me when we went around our first sharp curve at speed in the car on Saturday. I had propped my foot up on a pillow in the passenger-side footwell, and either centrifugal force or gravity or some other physics-related force ended up tilting my foot to the left as we went around the curve. I actually squealed in pain, and it took the better part of the trip for me to figure out how to brace my foot appropriately so that it wouldn't tilt again.
</p>

<p>
I didn't discover <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/487511600/in/photostream/">the bruising</a> until I took the wrap off at my in-laws' house; judging from the photos of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/21062046@N00/481101764/">another wounded warrior</a> on Flickr (she sprained *her* ankle a day or two before I did mine), the bruising seems to be a normal turn of events, and not the result of additional injury or a sign of misdiagnosis. (I had actually assumed that it was either a sign that I was healing, or a sign that I'd been walking around too much, causing all the loose blood from the injury to pool at the bottom of my foot. It's probably both.)
</p>

<p>
Today Al took the Beaner to sharecare, but I'm still hoping that by Wednesday&#8212;with a little more rest and a lot of Advil&#8212;I'll be able to take him myself, in the car if not on foot. Clutching is mostly about tilting one's foot forward and back rather than side to side, so I'm thinking I will be able to manage. Probably a test drive around the block with Al in the car on Tuesday night would be wise, just in case I stall the car and can't work the clutch well enough to get started again.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I am totally jonesing for a Starbucks (or Tuscany Cafe) latte. I gorged on them this weekend, when Al was available to drive me around and even run in and fetch drinks for me, but now I'm stuck back in the house. It occurs to me that it might have been a good idea to stop at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods or Wegmans (or even Safeway) on the way home yesterday, as we're still very low on decent eat-from-the-fridge/freezer/pantry-without-having-to-stand-at-the-stove-for-an-hour foods. Is it worth it to hobble the three and a half blocks to Trader Joe's? Would it be crazy to hobble the two blocks to the CarShare pod to rent a(n automatic) Scion xB for an hour to drive to TJ's or WF (OR STARBUCKS)? Is the Universe trying to keep me in my seat by preventing me from logging in to the stupid Philly CarShare website to reserve a car, despite having the correct username and password? Hmmmm.
</p>

<h3 class="title">My Name in the Same Breath as NPR's</h3>

<p>
So a few weeks ago, when I was in San Francisco (i.e., away from my normal personal laptop with its handy mail filters), I got an e-mail from someone wanting to know if I wanted to help NPR. I deleted the message as spam without reading it. A week later, I got another e-mail with the same subject (prepended this time with Re:)... and from the same sender. This time I decided to check out the headers and <em>maybe even open it</em>.
</p>

<p>
It turned out to be a legitimate request to use one of my Flickr photos in a video piece for NPR.
</p>

<p>
<em>Wait!</em>, I know you're thinking, <em>NPR stands for National Public RADIO. That *has* to be a scam!</em> No really, it wasn't. Like everyone else, NPR has decided to dip its toes into the web video waters... and the piece they wanted the photo for was <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/bryantpark/2007/05/dont_stand_so_close_to_me.html">posted on NPR's website</a> earlier this week. My photo is in the video for about half a second&#8212;I think my credit is actually on the screen longer&#8212;but hey, it's still kinda neat.*
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="npr_credits.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/npr_credits.jpg" width="500" height="482" />
</p>

<p style="font-size:smaller">
* I specifically got permission from my teammates in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/426786162/in/photostream/">the photo</a> before I gave the go-ahead for the producer to use it. We all agreed that it didn't really demonstrate the "elevator effect"&#8212;everyone was looking in different directions mainly because several different conversations were going on at the same time&#8212;but we didn't see any harm in it being used in the piece, and I think we're all familiar with the phenomenon. In my experience, it's more commonly found in locker rooms at pickup games, where you're unlikely to know the other participants, than it is when you're sharing three square feet of space with a teammate you know well.

<h3 class="title">Up With Downs</h3>

<p>
Interesting article in the NYT today: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/us/09down.html?ex=1336449600&en=4e95d7e65c3cf9d1&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">Prenatal Test Puts Down Syndrome in Hard Focus</a>. Totally brought back memories of my own pregnancy, and the discussions preceeding it.
</p>

<p>
As someone who didn't feel equipped to parent at all, the prospect of parenting a disabled child left me shaking with fear. Before I agreed to try getting pregnant, Al and I talked about all the possible outcomes we could think of, and how we would react to each one. I wanted to make sure we were on the same page before we made what for me was an incredible leap of faith. One of the decisions we made was that we'd terminate the pregnancy if testing revealed Downs syndrome. 
</p>

<p>
Fast-forward about 8 or 9 months, to when I was roughly 3 months pregnant. I still remember the day&#8212;I think it was after the amniocentesis but before we'd gotten the results&#8212;when we were at the mall, and we passed a parent with a Downs child on the escalator. That child was so beautiful. Functional. <em>Happy.</em> I squeezed Al's and hand and said, "I don't care if it's Downs. I think I could parent a Downs baby." Al said, "I was thinking the same thing."
</p>

<p>
Was I relieved that the Beaner was healthy and did not have an extra chromosome? YOU BETCHA. Would I judge anyone who terminated a pregnancy because of a Downs diagnosis? NEVER. But I also don't think I'll ever forget that little girl on the escalator. Somehow I get the feeling that the world is a better place with her in it.

<h3 class="title">Busy Busy</h3>

<p>
Sorry for the slim postings over here lately. I now have so much to say about the Beaner that I don't even know where to begin... and so I don't, because I don't have time to write a serial novel at the moment. Work, you know. Lots to do.
</p>

<p>
Things I could be writing about:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The Beaner's Dora/Diego obsession, and the various ways it's spilling into our lives ("Starbucks, Bus Stop, Beaner's House!", "Bridge, Gas Station, King of Pizza!")</li>
<li>Today's visit to the allergist, and the things we both tested negative for (but which we react to in daily life)</li>
<li>The "it's all about ME" mentality he seems to have these days. (No, son, it's all about ME. Haven't you heard?)</li>
<li>The ankle. Yes, it still hurts. Yes, I'm still walking around on it. Yes, I'm still icing and wrapping and elevating and taking Advil. Yes, I'm impatient&#8212;why do you ask?</li>
<li>The 5 lbs. I've gained since the injury. I seem to have underestimated the number of calories I was burning just running up and down the stairs on a daily basis, walking the Beaner to sharecare, and just going about my life at a normal pace&#8212;things I'm not doing right now.</li>
<li>How much I am positively PINING to start doing any form of exercise again (and not just because of the weight gain). I feel like a slug. (And yes, I'm doing a bit of Pilates, but it's not enough for me.)</li>
<li>The way the Beaner just sneakily poked his head out of his door to see if I had really left him in there to fall asleep alone. Totally cracked me UP.</li>
<li>The adventure we had at Wegman's the other night when I suddenly couldn't walk anymore, Al had to fetch me a Costanza Cart, and then I nearly mowed down the woman in front of me at the checkout line when the Beaner grabbed the accelerator.

Oops, there's the husband. He takes precedence over both work and blogging. Gotta go.

<h3 class="title">PsCS3</h3>

<p>
I never really considered myself a Photoshop person. Well, maybe for a brief time about 10 years ago, when I was using Ps2.5, but I never really got proficient at it because my scratch disk was always full.
</p>

<p>
Once Fireworks came out, that's all I really needed to create web graphics and simple illustrations (Illustrator was far beyond my capabilities, and Freehand was only barely within them), and it was also all I felt I needed for photo editing. I used it pretty much exclusively until I started downloading all my photos to my work MacBook (because it's here at my desk, where I can casually upload 5 or 10 photos at a time in between doing work-related tasks), which did not have Fireworks installed on it. At that point, I just used the editing tools in iPhoto to adjust contrast, exposure, saturation, and sharpness.
</p>

<p>
One day&#8212;probably after Heather Champ's photography session at BlogHer, where I finally learned how to use Unsharp Mask&#8212;I wasn't able to get the levels right in iPhoto at all, so I downloaded Photoshop CS2. While it did a perfect job of getting the levels right in a single step (Auto Levels, of course), its tenure as the default editor for iPhoto only lasted about a week. It was slow to start up, slow to use, and I wasn't familiar enough with how to use all the tools and menu items (aside from the aforementioned Auto Levels and Unsharp Mask, and I wasn't even sure I was doing those absolutely correctly) to make it worth the wait. I went back to using the Adjustments panel in iPhoto, and only launched Photoshop if iPhoto refused to cooperate.
</p>

<p>
After hearing folks rave about how much faster the Universal Binary was in Photoshop CS3, I finally decided to brave the giant download and try it out. Yowsa! Suddenly I've become, well, if not <em>proficient</em> in Photoshop, at least <em>efficient</em> in Photoshop. I still feel like I'm just scratching the surface, and my photo-editing talents are slim indeed, but I'm finding my way around at a much quicker pace since upgrading. (I'm sure I will be making y'all sick with my weird effects over the coming weeks.) Oh, and Photoshop CS3 has become my default editor for iPhoto again. It launches in a snap, opens photos for editing even faster (and way faster than Fireworks does on the Mac Mini downstairs), and makes matching color among several shots easy as pie. SO COOL.
</p>

<p>
I can't recommend Photoshop CS3 highly enough, especially if you're on a Mac.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Don't Try This at Home</h3>

<p>
My parents were here for the weekend, mainly to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157600211595415/">play with the Beaner and have Mother's Day brunch on Sunday</a> (link goes to PHOTOS), but also so that mom could fill in for a vacationing nanny on Monday. Anyway, on Saturday I asked my dad if he wanted one of the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/09/scones.html">scones</a> I'd just made and a cup of coffee, and he said yes.
</p>

<p>
So I pulled the mason jar of coffee out of the fridge, poured some in a mug, microwaved it til hot, and had Al bring it downstairs to my dad. I then heard the following float up from the basement playroom:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Dad: </strong>Yum, this coffee is really good. Very flavorful and rich. What kind is it?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Al: </strong>I suspect it's a special Lori Blend.
</p>

<p>
It was. And like all of my successful experiments, the results are not necessarily repeatable. However, I try anyway&#8212;and here's what anyone else would need to try, too:
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/501010287/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/231/501010287_8e414d2f3e.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="coffee supplies" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Coffee:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Two spoonfuls (see spoon in foreground for size) of a 3:1 blend of Stew Leonards' Decaf Chocolate Mousse and Stew Leonards' Decaf Kauai, <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/08/daytripping.html">purchased last summer</a>.</li>
<li>Two and a half spoonfuls of Decaf Kona, given to me for my birthday by Hannah in October.</li>
<li>Three spoonfuls of Blue Bottle Coffee Decaf Noir, given to me by Kristin last month.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Procedure:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Grind the long-expired beans together for approximately 12 seconds in a coffee grinder.</li>
<li>Fill the carafe of an automatic drip coffeemaker to the 6-cup line with water from all the half-drunk water bottles you've found in the stroller room, filtered through the Brita pitcher.</li>
<li>Pour water into coffeemaker, then line filter cone with paper filter and dump grounds in (make sure to scrape off any clumps that stick to the grinder with the spoon).</li>
<li>Close filter cone, replace carafe, and turn coffeemaker on.</li>
<li>While coffee is brewing, fill mug 1/3 full with milk and microwave for 40 seconds, if desired. Frothing with crap frothing utensil purchased for $15 from Restoration Hardware optional.</li>
<li>Pour coffee into mug.</li>
<li>Turn off coffeemaker and allow carafe and coffee to cool.</li>
<li>When coffee is at room temperature, pour remainder into mason jar and store in fridge for later microwaving or iced coffee.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note: If you're planning to drink the coffee primarily over ice, I'd recommend swapping the chocolate blend and Blue Bottle ratios. The extra chocolate flavor is especially nice over ice with whole milk.
</p>

<p>
Note Note: In case it isn't obvious from the title of this post and the wackiness of the ingredients, YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY. Mine does.

<h3 class="title">Gap Tall Has Failed Me</h3>

<p>
 I feel like Goldilocks, in search of the perfect t-shirt. WHY is it SO HARD to find something that won't leave my ass crack exposed when I sit (or my belly button exposed when I stand, for that matter) while at the same time being flattering? Is my waist so long, my tits so small, and my ass so big that there is no happy medium to be found anywhere? There has to be something between this:
</p>

<h3 class="title">On The Off-Chance That Someone *Does* Care What I Had For Lunch</h3>

<p>
I'm finding that I'm sort of blogging in my photo descriptions on Flickr rather than posting here with a link to the Flickr photo these days. The photo of what I had for lunch today is a case in point (though I've opted to link to the photo below as well because I'm really proud of how the croutons practically jump out of the screen), and so are the every-two-or-three-days <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/sprainedankle/">ankle updates</a>.
</p>

<p>
I think this is partly because I'm lazy (it's too much of a pain to copy the code to Movable Type), and partly because if the whole post is about a single photo, it makes  sense to just tell the story in context, next to the photo. In any case, this is what I had for lunch today:

<h3 class="title">Leisurely</h3>

<p>
 Greetings from SUNNY Seattle! We flew in yesterday to lovely cool spring weather, had a late lunch across the street and totally didn't care when the waitress forgot to put in part of our order and ended up serving us 20 minutes apart, went swimming and soaking in the hotel pool and jacuzzi, and toured the neighborhood a bit before putting the Beaner to bed early (we'd gotten him in his jammies before the walk so he could fall asleep in the stroller if he wanted, and he did). Travel was smooth and delay-free (in fact, we arrived early to both Chicago and Seattle), and we had the most relaxing and white knuckle-free cab ride the airport ever. The only bumps in the road were a bit of difficulty getting the carseat into our rental (a Toyota Highlander because they didn't have the Equinox we'd reserved), and the incredibly stupid move on our part of staying up to watch the LOST season finale after only getting 3 hours' sleep the night before. (Oh well, at least those two hours could also be used to upload the remaining 8 images from the Freeze bowling partly last weekend; while downloading via the &quot;high-speed&quot; internet in the hotel room is relatively quick, uploads happen in 30-40k bursts every 4-5 seconds.) Luckily we managed to convince the Beaner to go back to sleep for 3 more hours this morning after we woke up at 5:30am clawing and elbowing me until I shouted STOP IT! in sleep-deprived frustration.
</p>


<p>
My first instinct on getting out of bed at 8:30 this morning was, &quot;oh, we'd better hurry and get to the market for breakfast!&quot;... but then I thought &quot;hey, this leisurely thing is working for us. Whatever is available when we get there will be the right thing.&quot; And it was: We stopped first at Three Girls bakery and ordered vast quantities of baked goods, continued on to the original Starbucks Coffee &amp; Tea store for coffee, chai, and soymilk, and then crossed the street to the park to eat at a picnic table overlooking Puget Sound.
</p>

<br />
I took the photo of the sign last night; I took the rest this morning, when there were no clouds at all in the sky.
</p>
<p>
Being leisurely doesn't mean we weren't being calculating; the idea behind eating breakfast first, aside from satisfying hunger, was to keep us from shopping hungry and buying more than we could possibly eat later. Having been to Pike Place Market before, I had an idea that this strategy might not work, but it was worth trying. Looking at the array of brown bags that I helpfully labled DONUTS, PRETZELS &amp; BROWNIE, CHERRIES, NUTS, PEACHES, CHOC. CROISS., and MAC &amp; CHEESE on the desk here in front of me, I'd say that we were about as prone to buying things that looked yummy as ever. (I didn't even list the bags that *aren't* in front of me, which contain the leftover scones from breakfast, the most delicious red grapes I've had in a long time, blackberries, cheese curds, smoked salmon, and apple chips.) Most of these items we'll be saving to eat in the car on the way to Vancouver tomorrow, though I ate the Mac &amp; Cheese from Beecher's cheese shop for lunch, and the Beaner has already had a bunch of grapes while watching Dora.

</p>

<p>
Anyway, as you can tell from our purchases we had a lovey morning at the market, poking around several t-shirt and craft booths as well as the food stalls. I got a cool t-shirt that was designed for a friend of the seller's 45th birthday (I'll upload a photo if it later, and the connection to 45 will be obvious to anyone old enough, like me, to remember 45rpm records). For the Beaner we got a  Pike Place Market T and a kid-sized apron with a lobster on the front (his choice of design). After posing with the pig and watching the fishmongers throw and catch salmon (and learning from another fishmonger that the enormous halibut we were looking at was just a 20-lb. baby), we walked back up Pike Street toward our hotel. Al pushed the Beaner in the heavily-laden stroller (sadly, my ankle is VERY sore again today thanks to a couple tweaks yesterday) and continued on to what the Beaner calls the hotowel while I stopped at Rite Aid to buy some new toothbrushes (the Beaner used ours to clean a spot on the carpet when we weren't looking) and Borders to get some Dora and Diego books for the Beaner to read in the car tomorrow. I'm very much enjoying the mosey time with my family, but perhaps the best moment so far today I spent alone, on the corner across from our hotel, waiting for the walk sign and marvelling at the absolutely clear blue sky.

<h3 class="title">Prescription: Doughnut</h3>

<p>
The Beaner has always been what people call "a good eater". We don't have standoffs over what he will and won't eat, he's never gone on an all-white diet or a hunger strike, and the biggest food problem we've ever had is running out of his favorite fruit of the moment. (He doesn't seem to understand that we're not just denying him when we say "there is no more mango, honey.") He's a healthy, strapping, active boy who's at the top of the weight charts, but not fat.
</p>

<p>
The main thing I worry about, I think, is his sugar intake. Ever since Al and I started eating less of the stuff, I think we've been a little more eager to give treats to the Beaner&#8212;perhaps as a means of living vicariously through him. It's not a good idea, and I've been trying to get incidental sugars out of his diet as much as possible. (The food industry seems to be conspiring against me, however, in that I'm not able to find many portable foods in child-friendly serving sizes that aren't also loaded with fat, sugar, and preservatives. Thank god for portable foods like carrots, apples, and bananas!)
</p>

<p>
I mention all this in prelude to a little story that both made me laugh and scared me to my very core: On Sunday, after I'd played my last hockey game and taken the Beaner swimming in the hotel pool, he and I went out to an early dinner together. Al wasn't feeling well (he hadn't been all weekend, sadly, which made being the parent on duty a bit hellish), so he stayed in the hotel room to sleep. I got a sandwich to go from the restaurant so Al could have some dinner, too, and then I realized that we'd be passing a Tim Horton's on the way back as well. Al had expressed a desire to stop at Tim Horton's for a donut when we'd been out the day before, but we hadn't had time.
</p>

<p>
"Are we going back to the hotowel?" asked the Beaner.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sweetie, but first I'm going to stop here for a second."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because Daddy's not feeling well, and I want to make him feel better." I don't think I even mentioned that I was going to buy donuts, but the Beaner had apparently been paying attention when Al connected the location with the word "donut" ealier.
</p>

<p>
"I think I need a donut, too," he said, "because, you know, I'm not feeling so well either."
</p>

<p>
HE REALLY SAID THAT. When I posted this photo from Pike Place Market on Friday, the connection between eating and "feeling better" that the Beaner often makes was already on my mind. Now he's thinking a donut is medicinal? Uh oh.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/514022939/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/192/514022939_e225c71d83.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="eat this... feel better" /></a>
</p>

<p>
If I thought he would forget this donut = medicine idea, I was wrong. On Monday, he spent the day sneezing icky yellow snot from his nostrils, and by the late afternoon I was worried that his affliction was catching. My glands were a bit swollen and my throat was sore, so I unwrapped a Halls cough drop to suck on (why menthol works to keep colds away, I don't know, but often a little Vicks or Halls will do the trick). The Beaner saw me peeling the paper off the red square and said, "I want one!" I said, "oh, this is medicine, buddy, not candy. I'm taking it because I'm not feeling well."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe you should have a donut," he replied.
</p>

<p>
We're back from an orientation at the preschool the Beaner will be attending in the fall, where we learned about the drop off and pick up procedures, what goes on during the school day, some the Montessori materials, that parents are expected to participate on the board and on committees, etc. I'm sitting at my desk, attempting to stuff an egg salad sandwich past the world's largest canker sore (thanks to a savagely bitten lip), and Al is going back and forth between the bedroom and the bathroom, preparing for his shower and eating a chicken salad sandwich. The Beaner is in the tub, singing.
