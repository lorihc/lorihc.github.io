<h3 class="title">Don't Try This at Home</h3>

<p>
My parents were here for the weekend, mainly to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157600211595415/">play with the Beaner and have Mother's Day brunch on Sunday</a> (link goes to PHOTOS), but also so that mom could fill in for a vacationing nanny on Monday. Anyway, on Saturday I asked my dad if he wanted one of the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/09/scones.html">scones</a> I'd just made and a cup of coffee, and he said yes.
</p>
<p>
So I pulled the mason jar of coffee out of the fridge, poured some in a mug, microwaved it til hot, and had Al bring it downstairs to my dad. I then heard the following float up from the basement playroom:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Dad: </strong>Yum, this coffee is really good. Very flavorful and rich. What kind is it?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Al: </strong>I suspect it's a special Lori Blend.
</p>

<p>
It was. And like all of my successful experiments, the results are not necessarily repeatable. However, I try anyway&#8212;and here's what anyone else would need to try, too:
</p>

</p>

<p>
Coffee:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Two spoonfuls (see spoon in foreground for size) of a 3:1 blend of Stew Leonards' Decaf Chocolate Mousse and Stew Leonards' Decaf Kauai, <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/08/daytripping.html">purchased last summer</a>.</li>
<li>Two and a half spoonfuls of Decaf Kona, given to me for my birthday by Hannah in October.</li>
<li>Three spoonfuls of Blue Bottle Coffee Decaf Noir, given to me by Kristin last month.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Procedure:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Grind the long-expired beans together for approximately 12 seconds in a coffee grinder.</li>
<li>Fill the carafe of an automatic drip coffeemaker to the 6-cup line with water from all the half-drunk water bottles you've found in the stroller room, filtered through the Brita pitcher.</li>
<li>Pour water into coffeemaker, then line filter cone with paper filter and dump grounds in (make sure to scrape off any clumps that stick to the grinder with the spoon).</li>
<li>Close filter cone, replace carafe, and turn coffeemaker on.</li>
<li>While coffee is brewing, fill mug 1/3 full with milk and microwave for 40 seconds, if desired. Frothing with crap frothing utensil purchased for $15 from Restoration Hardware optional.</li>
<li>Pour coffee into mug.</li>
<li>Turn off coffeemaker and allow carafe and coffee to cool.</li>
<li>When coffee is at room temperature, pour remainder into mason jar and store in fridge for later microwaving or iced coffee.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note: If you're planning to drink the coffee primarily over ice, I'd recommend swapping the chocolate blend and Blue Bottle ratios. The extra chocolate flavor is especially nice over ice with whole milk.
</p>

<p>
Note Note: In case it isn't obvious from the title of this post and the wackiness of the ingredients, YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY. Mine does.

<p>That post made me snort my beverage out my nose.</p>

<p>Sadly, it was not coffee, just water.</p>

<p>Just the other day, I made myself coffee specifically so I could chill it and drink it cold.  If I were more organized, I'd just make a pot and freeze it in ice cube trays, which make hot coffee cold without diluting it.</p>

<p>Why do I never think of freezing the coffee in ice cube trays? Perhaps next time I will double my recipe and put half into the ice cube trays we bought to freeze pureed fruits and vegetables for the Beaner when he was learning to eat solids (and which we haven't used in almost two years). </p>

<p>I should add that the coffee made from the above recipe, if ground correctly, is rather strong and can stand up to milk and ice, but I *am* rather taken with the coffee cube idea.</p>

<p>I love coffee ice cubes.  Anthony's coffeehouse down in the Italian Market makes and used them for all their iced coffee drinks, which makes me love them a great deal (not to mention they have really good coffee and a nice place to sit and people-watch in good weather).  </p>

<p><a href="http://juliloquy.typepad.com/" rel="nofollow">Julie</a> makes killer scones. It's her trademark treat at our Quaker meeting's coffee socials. Your coffee recipe sounds like something she'd do, too. You two ought to collaborate on a meme about zany leftover recipes that you've served to the unsuspecting public.</p>
