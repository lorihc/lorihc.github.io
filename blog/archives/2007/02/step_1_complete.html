<h3 class="title">Step 1 Completed!</h3>

<p>
OK, step 1 in the upgrade process is finally complete: I've moved from Berkeley DB to MySQL. While doing this, I discovered a couple things:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The 2000+ entries are for all blogs total, not just this one.</li>
<li>There's a bug in MT 3.2 such that junk comments and trackbacks were not being deleted every 5 days, as I'd specified in my settings.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Because of #2, I had trouble converting my databases, and that's how I discovered #1 (which isn't a problem at all, really). It turns out that #2 is probably the reason I've been having trouble with MT bogging down&#8212;and showing a blank page after completing any operation. There were THOUSANDS upon THOUSANDS of junk comments and trackbacks in my databases, and I had to delete practically all of them by hand, 75-125 at a time, because of the aforementioned blank page problem&#8212;a process that took all day (partly because I was doing it between work tasks). Once the junk was all cleared out, however, I was able to convert my databases successfully, and hopefully MT will be more responsive. This post is the first test of the new setup.
</p>

<p>
Next up: Upgrading from MT 3.2 to MT 3.34. Maybe tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update: </strong>Yes! It's speedier! No more blank pages! YIPPPEEEE!
