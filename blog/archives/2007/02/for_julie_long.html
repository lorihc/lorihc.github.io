<h3 class="title">For Julie: Long, Thick Hair</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://juliloquy.typepad.com/juliloquy/">Julie</a> commented almost instantaneously on my last post, asking that evidence of my long, thick hair be presented. I actually went searching through my mom's old photo albums when I was at her house last weekend looking for evidence of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bershon/">bershon</a>, but I discovered that mom had thrown most of them out. Sadly, she assumed nobody would want to see me with a sour teenage bershon face, so she didn't even check to see if I wanted them.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, my point is that I could have produced PLENTY of evidence of long, thick hair last weekend, when I had access to my mom's photo albums, even if there was only one decent shot of bershon (saved only because it was a cute photo of my cousin). Today, since I'm at my house, I had to go digging. I hit a relative jackpot, though: My mom *did* send me a bunch of old school photos a couple years ago; at the time, I promptly stashed them in my Memorabilia Box and forgot about them. For your amusement, I now present my 6th, 7th, 8th, and 11th grade school photos. (My high school in Needham only photographed seniors, so I have no school photos from 9th or 10th grade. The unfortunate photo at bottom, however, was taken when I was in 10th grade. I have an even better one from 10th grade that I brought into work for a "when we were kids" photo array a few years ago, but I can't find it right now.)

6th grade<br />
Slight shoulder stoop in evidence. In 5th grade they thought I might have scoliosis, but it turned out to be slight sheepishness.

7th grade<br />
&lt;sigh&gt; braces.

8th grade<br />
The unfortunate perm. I took a photo from a magazine to my hairdresser, who tried to approximate it (after warning me that my hair was not the same, blah blah blah). It took YEARS for my hair to recover.

11th grade<br />
Clearly the 80s. This was my favorite school photo by far (6th grade was my second favorite).

10th grade<br />
Me and my friend Kristin in the cafeteria. Yes, I'm wearing tiny running shorts.

<p>OK, I really have to do a hair retropective now. That 8th grade shot indicates that you and I may have been separated at birth, although I kept rockin' the perm (with tsunami bangs) through college.</p>

<p>Hilarious. Yes, my friends referred to my bangs as "the tube", though late in 8th grade I finally got my hair layered, and the wings I'd always intended to have finally laid flat. :)</p>

<p>Okay, for years I tried to find resemblances between you and your parents and just couldn't do it. Now...your 6th grade photo unveils the little Mrs. Hylan behind the platinum hair and mischevious eyes!</p>

<p>Funny! I always thought I looked a bit more like my dad as a kid... but when I found this photo, what I saw in it was not my resemblance to my parents, but the Beaner's resemblance to me. </p>

<p>I truly love seeing people's old photos. It's so much fun! I shared a few of those hairstyles. Those '80s 'dos are undeniably memorable!</p>

<p>OMG - in your 11th grade picture you sure do look like your mom!!! And in some photos I've caught a little of Alice!</p>

<p>Do you remember me at all? Mail me and let me know! It's been a long time! If I don't hear from you in a few days, I'll fill you in!</p>

<p>By the way, I'm dumb and don't know what "Remember Me" (above) is all about, so I checked Yes, because I remember you.:)</p>
