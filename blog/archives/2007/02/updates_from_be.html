<h3 class="title">Updates from Beanerworld</h3>

<p>
The Beaner had his interview at the Montessori school around the corner on Saturday, and I have now gone from "whatever happens, happens" to "god, I hope he gets in." He so obviously LOVED it that I think I'll be disappointed if they don't take him. The good news is that I got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTeaching-Montessori-Home-Pre-School-Years%2Fdp%2F0452279097%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1170963002%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">a book on homeschooling Montessori-style</a> and am in the process of formulating a backup plan for schooling him in the mornings before starting work should the school not accept him this year.

<p>
On the sleep/big boy bed front, I finally lost it the other night and declared that Things Must Change. The Beaner was staying up later and later, to the extent that there was no Grown-Up Time and no Work at Night Time before Al and I fell into a grumpy and exhausted sleep. We started a new schedule last night that involved eating dinner together as soon as Al got hom from work (i.e., around 6:30), starting the bathtime routine at 7:30, and getting in bed at 8:00. We figured we'd sacrifice a little sleep in the morning for more adult time at night.
</p>

<p>
A small wrench was thrown into the schedule when, after getting in bed and starting a reading of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FZin-Violin-Caldecott-Honor-Book%2Fdp%2F0671882392%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1170963915%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Zin! Zin! Zin! A Violin</a>, the Beaner announced that he had to poop. Announcements like this at bedtime are becoming more regular, which is a good thing&#8212;except when you're getting in bed at 9:30pm or later. Good thing we got in bed at 8. So anyway, he pooped, he got back in bed, we finished reading our book, I turned out the light, and I spent about the next 40 minutes trying to convince him to go to sleep. He finally conked out at 9pm, after I employed my never-fail technique of threatening to leave.
</p>

<p>
We heard him crying a bit a little before midnight, but at that point we were in the middle of a full-blown discussion on the merits and drawbacks of cocktail playdates, so we ignored him. By the time we were finished and ready to go to sleep, he was quiet.
</p>

<p>
We fully expected to be woken at 6:50am or so, given that he'd fallen asleep a good 30-90 minutes earlier than usual, and his normal wakeup time is between 7:20 and 8:20am. When my watch alarm went off at 7:50am, however, he was still asleep. I got out of bed to shower at 8am, trudged up the stairs (since our master bathroom is out of order&#8212;though there's good news on that front in that our contractor finally responded to our desperate pleas and is ready to take our deposit and order cabinetry&#8212;we all have to bathe upstairs for the time being), noticed that I'd forgotten to close the gate in the Beaner's doorway, closed the gate, and then jumped in the shower, where I proceeded to drop razors and bottles and lids rather noisily.
