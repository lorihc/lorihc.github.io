<h3 class="title">Why I'm Working on Replacing My Wardrobe</h3>

<p>
Have I mentioned that I'm in the process of replacing my entire stock of tops (shirts, sweaters, etc.) with offerings from Gap Tall? I'm doing this because now that I have three shirts whose sleeves reach my wrists, I WANT MORE. Suddenly all the shirts and sweaters that have always been a little short in the torso and the arms look even more ridiculous than they did before, because now I know that there's an alternative.
</p>
<p>
I used to complain about how nothing ever fit me, but somewhere along the line I got used to it. Somewhere along the line I also acquired a bunch of tops purchased from the men's racks at Gap and Old Navy (one of which I'm wearing right now), which solved the too-small-in-the-arms-torso-and-shoulders problems I was having, but which did nothing to make me look like a girl. Most of the time I look like a teenage boy, which is probably why it's not surprising that Aura pointed out to me, when I went downstairs to get something out of the laundry room and found Aura and the Beaner reading books, that whenever the Beaner sees a the pre-teen boy hopping over the fire hydrant on page 3 of Tana Hoban's <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/61-9780027448207-0">over, under &amp; through</a>, he says, "dat Mommy!"
</p>

<p>
I am doing my best to pick out girlier options on the Gap Tall website, though I do still find myself gravitating to the simple t-shirts and thermals commonly found in the closets of teenage boys. I should also note that a couple attempts to go girly have been foiled by other tall shoppers with faster mousing fingers than I&#8212;apparently size M and L go VERY quickly among the tall&#8212;and that the Gap doesn't always have the widest selection of girly options. Ideally I'd find another online tall store that let me return anything that didn't fit my body or my style to a local brick-and-mortar store, as Gap does, so I could have a wider array of fashion options. (I'm done with returning purchases by mail.) Any suggestions?

<p>Ah, to have such trouble.<br />
But alas - I am very short, so have the opposite problem. </p>

<p>For kicks I clicked over to Banana Republic, since they are owned by Gap - saw they have a "NEW!" next to the "Women's Tall" category. So maybe there is something there...</p>

<p>And then "Rebecca & Drew" (http://www.rebeccaanddrew.com/) does customized shirts: sleeve length + bra size + torso length. </p>

<p>Yeah, I had that same thought about Banana Republic and also discovered the Tall section. Sadly, I've never been a fan of BR in general, and their Tall collection is so Not Me I can't even tell you. :) I'll check out Rebecca & Drew, tho, thanks! <br />

<p>Have you tried Land's End? Some tall offerings, and at least some items can be returned to Sears stores. Worth looking into, maybe.</p>

<p>Just had a look at Lands End -- sadly, not my thing.</p>

<p>Okay...REALLY sorry I don't have a clothing suggestion, but I am going to comment on the hydrant picture. I'm still laughing at the comparison! The picture itself is hysterical...do you remember, "Never play leap frog with a unicorn!" That's totally what came to mind when I first saw the photo. Plus, you don't look like him...you are MUCH taller!! :-)</p>

<p>My latest order of Gap Tall items just arrived, so I think I should be good for a while (at least until the stock turns over online).</p>

<p>I had that same unicorn thought, too, Josie. ;)</p>

<p>Sadly, Gap Tall is only available online at gap.com -- but the good news is you can return anything you don't like to any Gap store. AND if you buy $100 worth of stuff, shipping is free with the coupon code FREE100. <br />
