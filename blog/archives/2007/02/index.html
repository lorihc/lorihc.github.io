<h3 class="title">26 Months</h3>

<p>
The Beaner turned 26 months old yesterday. I celebrated by giving him a haircut and putting him in underpants. He spent all day Saturday in underpants with only one notable accident, and after staying dry in his Pull-Up all day Sunday (when we went on a 3-hour car trip) and Monday, I decided he was ready for daily underpants. As on Saturday we had one notable accident, but other than that it went *really* well. We still have a little work to do before I'm ready to declare him completely toilet trained&#8212;he's still wearing, and wetting, a regular diaper at night, for example&#8212;but we're on our way, and we're very proud of him for what he's accomplished so far.
</p>


<p>
The fact that he's telling us when he has to go is HUGE. I still ask him occasionally, and I and the nannies always take him before leaving the house and upon returning whether he's announced he has to go or not, but the fact that, for example, he told me he had to go after about 20 minutes of bedtime snuggling last night was key. He did, in fact, have to go. Tonight he said he had to pee twice after getting out of the tub, and he went both times&#8212;once quite a bit, and once just a dribble. The important thing is that he knows what it feels like to have to go.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, enough of the toilet news. Also big in the Beaner's world right now is The Great Jeep Rescue (also sometimes referred to as The Grate Jeep Rescue). Observe the little black Jeep in the Beaner's left hand in the following video:

<p>
About 15 minutes after I shot this video, here's what happened to the Jeep:
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<img src="/blog/images/parenthood/2007/jeep_grate1.jpg" alt="jeep down the grate" width="480" height="360" /><img src="/blog/images/parenthood/2007/jeep_grate2.jpg" alt="jeep down the grate" width="480" height="360" /><br />
The first shot was intended to show the Jeep clearly; the second was intended to show how far down it was. <br />
The second didn't really do its job, so I estimated for Al that it was about 6 feet down.
</p>
<p>
After taking these photos, sadly we had to abandon the Jeep. The Beaner never stopped talking about it, though. &quot;The Jeep fell down the grate?&quot; he'd ask, and I said, &quot;Yes, honey, I'm sorry. Maybe we'll get another one someday.&quot; Al actually ordered him another one online that very night, but he also couldn't stop thinking about it. Two nights later he proposed that we stage a rescue.
</p>
<p>
We got an extendible pole from the garage, and Al stuck a wad of duct tape on the end of it. We tested it at home to see if it was strong enough to pick up a toy Jeep (it was), and I judged it to be long enough to reach down into the pit under the grate. Al got a heavy duty flashlight, and we headed out with our supplies, the Beaner, and the stroller. When we arrived at the grate, I started videotaping the rescue operation... and ended up capturing much more than I thought I would. A man shouted from across the street, &quot;whatchu got down there? I'll go down there for you!&quot; and, long story short, he did. He jumped six feet down, got the Beaner's Jeep, and hoisted himself back out. I recorded the whole thing, but I've been reluctant to post it in case we broke anything (including any laws). 
</p>
<p>
The video may not be public, but it's been viewed dozens of times already by the Beaner. He asks to see it several times a day, and he's learned how to click the Play button to play it again when it reaches the end. He narrates for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. He anticipates all the dialogue and says the lines before the characters in the video (i.e., me, Al, and the man) do. And he tells the story to everyone he meets. He told it to Jess before I'd had a chance to fill her in, holding up the Jeep and saying, &quot;dis my old Jeep [as opposed to the new one we might get someday to replace the old one, which fell down the grate]. The man got it for you.&quot; (He meant &quot;for me,&quot; obviously, but &quot;you&quot; and &quot;me&quot; is kind of a hard concept to explain.) Jess, a bit puzzled, replied, &quot;oh, really? That's great!&quot; The Beaner seized on this and, thinking she understood, followed up with, &quot;YEAH! It fell down the grate!&quot;
</p>
<p>
As far as growth goes, the Beaner's now squarely in size 3T clothes. He's roughly 37&quot; tall and weighs about 35 lbs. by our measurements. I haven't a clue how big his head is, but his winter hat is a size 4-6 (though it's a wee bit too big). I thought over the weekend that he might have gone up a shoe size, too, since he was limping  a bit when he walked, but when we arrived at the shoe store, he still measured at 7.5 (his current shoes are an 8). The reason for the occasional limping is still a mystery; at first we thought it was because the eczema on his legs was so bad that his pants hurt. After several days of regular lotioning the eczema has cleared up a bit, however, but the occasional limping continues. He claims nothing hurts, so I guess we'll just have to monitor it.
</p>
<p>
I think that's about all I haven't covered in previous posts and want to publicly, except to say that he's as cute as ever. Oh, and that he now seems able to take direction when I whip out the camera. He actually posed for these yesterday morning:

<h3 class="title">Why I'm Working on Replacing My Wardrobe</h3>

<p>
Have I mentioned that I'm in the process of replacing my entire stock of tops (shirts, sweaters, etc.) with offerings from Gap Tall? I'm doing this because now that I have three shirts whose sleeves reach my wrists, I WANT MORE. Suddenly all the shirts and sweaters that have always been a little short in the torso and the arms look even more ridiculous than they did before, because now I know that there's an alternative.
</p>

<p>
I used to complain about how nothing ever fit me, but somewhere along the line I got used to it. Somewhere along the line I also acquired a bunch of tops purchased from the men's racks at Gap and Old Navy (one of which I'm wearing right now), which solved the too-small-in-the-arms-torso-and-shoulders problems I was having, but which did nothing to make me look like a girl. Most of the time I look like a teenage boy, which is probably why it's not surprising that Aura pointed out to me, when I went downstairs to get something out of the laundry room and found Aura and the Beaner reading books, that whenever the Beaner sees a the pre-teen boy hopping over the fire hydrant on page 3 of Tana Hoban's <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/61-9780027448207-0">over, under &amp; through</a>, he says, "dat Mommy!"
</p>

</p>

<p>
I am doing my best to pick out girlier options on the Gap Tall website, though I do still find myself gravitating to the simple t-shirts and thermals commonly found in the closets of teenage boys. I should also note that a couple attempts to go girly have been foiled by other tall shoppers with faster mousing fingers than I&#8212;apparently size M and L go VERY quickly among the tall&#8212;and that the Gap doesn't always have the widest selection of girly options. Ideally I'd find another online tall store that let me return anything that didn't fit my body or my style to a local brick-and-mortar store, as Gap does, so I could have a wider array of fashion options. (I'm done with returning purchases by mail.) Any suggestions?

<h3 class="title">The Cure For The Winter Blues?</h3>

<p>
Did y'all know that <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Intl/USDST/">Daylight Saving Time is being extended this year</a>? Instead of starting on the first Sunday in April and ending on the last Sunday in October, it'll now start on the second Sunday in March and end on the first Sunday in November. In other words, DST will start on March 11 this year instead of April 1, and it'll end on November 4 instead of October 28.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to decide if this is a good or a bad thing. As someone who tends toward depression in the winter because of the lack of light&#8212;and as someone who's looked forward to Daylight Saving Time for her entire adult life the way I looked forward to Christmas as a kid&#8212;it seems like it would be a good thing. I'm so tuned to the way things are now, though, that I wonder if it will be a difficult adjustment.
</p>

<p>
I always know when DST is ending because I was born on the day the clocks changed in 1968. Thus, the weekend of or just after my birthday is the sad day when we fall back (though as a consolation prize, we gain an extra hour of sleep). I'm sure there will be other reminders in early November, but it won't be the same.
</p>

<p>
When I was in my early teens I used to have to get up for school ridiculously early (partly because I had long, incredibly thick hair, and it took at least 20 minutes to blow dry it), often before the sun was up. I used to look forward to March, when the days were starting to lengthen but DST had not yet arrived because it meant that the sun rose before I did. I loved the early morning light streaming through my windows. It felt peaceful and wonderful and renewing to wake up in that light. Daylight Saving Time's arrival was often a disappointment, plunging me as it did back into morning darkness.
</p>

<p>
Now I wake late enough that the sun is up before I am even in winter, so I don't think moving DST will make that much difference to my mornings. I also sit by a window all day while I work, so I maximize the light I get even on short winter days. I've been noticeably less chipper in the past couple months than I was in the preceeding fall or summer, but it's really not that bad. I think the fact that Philadelphia can be sunny even when it's bitterly cold outside (as it is now) helps a lot; I remember being more depressed in winter in San Francisco, where I also sat next to a window during the day, possibly because there were more overcast, rainy days. Ditto Boston, where it's more overcast than here.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of winter and bitter cold, today is a sharecare day, so I walked the Beaner over to his friend M's house in the stroller this morning. OH MY GOD, IT WAS COLD. We seem to have gone from merely freezing to absolutely brutal, and I was caught with no tights under my jeans. What was I thinking? Here's where, if you're a seasoned parent, you'll be saying out loud, "wait, you're worried about not wearing TIGHTS under your pants? What about your KID, freezing his ass off in the stroller?" And you'd be absolutely right.
</p>

<p>
I called Al after I left M's house to tell him how the Beaner refused the stroller cover halfway through the walk, even though he'd gone silent minutes into the walk (usually he sings until he gets too cold to do so, so he must have gotten cold fast), and how he'd started to whimper as we turned onto M's street. "Only a little farther, buddy!" I'd said. "Yeah," Al said. "As I was riding up the elevator in my building this morning, I remarked to a colleague how cold it was this morning. The colleague replied, 'yeah, it was so cold I had to drive my kids to school!'" We both paused for a second to smack our foreheads. We could have DRIVEN the Beaner to M's house. Duh. "We should pick him up in the car tonight," said Al. Um, yeah. Sometimes we are so STUPID.
</p>

<h3 class="title">For Julie: Long, Thick Hair</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://juliloquy.typepad.com/juliloquy/">Julie</a> commented almost instantaneously on my last post, asking that evidence of my long, thick hair be presented. I actually went searching through my mom's old photo albums when I was at her house last weekend looking for evidence of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bershon/">bershon</a>, but I discovered that mom had thrown most of them out. Sadly, she assumed nobody would want to see me with a sour teenage bershon face, so she didn't even check to see if I wanted them.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, my point is that I could have produced PLENTY of evidence of long, thick hair last weekend, when I had access to my mom's photo albums, even if there was only one decent shot of bershon (saved only because it was a cute photo of my cousin). Today, since I'm at my house, I had to go digging. I hit a relative jackpot, though: My mom *did* send me a bunch of old school photos a couple years ago; at the time, I promptly stashed them in my Memorabilia Box and forgot about them. For your amusement, I now present my 6th, 7th, 8th, and 11th grade school photos. (My high school in Needham only photographed seniors, so I have no school photos from 9th or 10th grade. The unfortunate photo at bottom, however, was taken when I was in 10th grade. I have an even better one from 10th grade that I brought into work for a "when we were kids" photo array a few years ago, but I can't find it right now.)
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

6th grade<br />
Slight shoulder stoop in evidence. In 5th grade they thought I might have scoliosis, but it turned out to be slight sheepishness.

7th grade<br />
&lt;sigh&gt; braces.

8th grade<br />
The unfortunate perm. I took a photo from a magazine to my hairdresser, who tried to approximate it (after warning me that my hair was not the same, blah blah blah). It took YEARS for my hair to recover.
</p>

11th grade<br />
Clearly the 80s. This was my favorite school photo by far (6th grade was my second favorite).

10th grade<br />
Me and my friend Kristin in the cafeteria. Yes, I'm wearing tiny running shorts.

<h3 class="title">Updates from Beanerworld</h3>

<p>
The Beaner had his interview at the Montessori school around the corner on Saturday, and I have now gone from "whatever happens, happens" to "god, I hope he gets in." He so obviously LOVED it that I think I'll be disappointed if they don't take him. The good news is that I got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTeaching-Montessori-Home-Pre-School-Years%2Fdp%2F0452279097%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1170963002%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">a book on homeschooling Montessori-style</a> and am in the process of formulating a backup plan for schooling him in the mornings before starting work should the school not accept him this year.
</p>

<p>
On the sleep/big boy bed front, I finally lost it the other night and declared that Things Must Change. The Beaner was staying up later and later, to the extent that there was no Grown-Up Time and no Work at Night Time before Al and I fell into a grumpy and exhausted sleep. We started a new schedule last night that involved eating dinner together as soon as Al got hom from work (i.e., around 6:30), starting the bathtime routine at 7:30, and getting in bed at 8:00. We figured we'd sacrifice a little sleep in the morning for more adult time at night.
</p>

<p>
A small wrench was thrown into the schedule when, after getting in bed and starting a reading of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FZin-Violin-Caldecott-Honor-Book%2Fdp%2F0671882392%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1170963915%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Zin! Zin! Zin! A Violin</a>, the Beaner announced that he had to poop. Announcements like this at bedtime are becoming more regular, which is a good thing&#8212;except when you're getting in bed at 9:30pm or later. Good thing we got in bed at 8. So anyway, he pooped, he got back in bed, we finished reading our book, I turned out the light, and I spent about the next 40 minutes trying to convince him to go to sleep. He finally conked out at 9pm, after I employed my never-fail technique of threatening to leave.
</p>

<p>
We heard him crying a bit a little before midnight, but at that point we were in the middle of a full-blown discussion on the merits and drawbacks of cocktail playdates, so we ignored him. By the time we were finished and ready to go to sleep, he was quiet. 
</p>

<p>
We fully expected to be woken at 6:50am or so, given that he'd fallen asleep a good 30-90 minutes earlier than usual, and his normal wakeup time is between 7:20 and 8:20am. When my watch alarm went off at 7:50am, however, he was still asleep. I got out of bed to shower at 8am, trudged up the stairs (since our master bathroom is out of order&#8212;though there's good news on that front in that our contractor finally responded to our desperate pleas and is ready to take our deposit and order cabinetry&#8212;we all have to bathe upstairs for the time being), noticed that I'd forgotten to close the gate in the Beaner's doorway, closed the gate, and then jumped in the shower, where I proceeded to drop razors and bottles and lids rather noisily.
</p>

<p>
While putting on lotion post-shower, I heard him cough and thought to myself, "wow, he's still up here." I figured he'd have woken and cried while I was showering, and that Al would've brought him downstairs. A few seconds later I heard the clank of metal against the gate and went to investigate. For the first time ever, the Beaner was standing at the gate, little black Jeep in hand, quietly waiting for someone to come get him. (Usually he sits in bed whining or crying&#8212;often with his eyes shut&#8212;until Al or I come to pick him up. We also usually have to go back later for the Jeep, which ends up stuffed under a pillow.)
</p>

<p>
I know it's only one night, and it's too early to declare victory, but boy, am I encouraged. Who knew that putting him to bed earlier could cause him to sleep LONGER? I'll worry about getting him up in time for school later... if he gets in.

<h3 class="title">Do Two Days Equal a Pattern?</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2007/02/updates_from_be_1.html#002059">It was not a fluke</a>. The Beaner fell asleep at 9pm last night, slept until about 8:20 this morning, and upon waking, got out of bed and waited patiently at the gate until his dad heard the metallic clunk of his little Jeep against the bars and went to get him.
</p>

<p>
Last night, we had time to:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Eat dinner together (yes, we each ate something different, but we sat at the table together and talked about our days)</li>
<li>Meet with the contractor about the bathroom and give him a deposit toward the cabinets and demo work</li>
<li>Dance and sing, "Sing, sing with mom" (to the tune of "Sing a Song") at the top of our lungs in the kitchen</li>
<li>Shower (Al and the Beaner)</li>
<li>Watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSchoolhouse-Rock-Grammar-Animated%2Fdp%2F6303493653%2Fsr%3D8-6%2Fqid%3D1171039808%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dvideo&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Grammar Rock</a> for the bajillionth time (my heart totally melted as the Beaner yelled out the chorus of the Interjection! song&#8212;so when you're happy (HOORAY!), or sad (AW!), or frightened (EEK!), or mad (RATS!), or excited (it's supposed to be WOW!, but for some reason he skips this one), or glad (HEY!), an interjection starts the sentence right!)
<li>Let the Beaner try to poop twice</li>
<li>Check in a bugfix (me)</li>
<li>Read a story to the Beaner</li>
<li>Snuggle the Beaner to sleep</li>
<li>Watch both Friday Night Lights and Veronica Mars (me and Al)</li>
<li>Read a chapter of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOmnivores-Dilemma-Natural-History-Meals%2Fdp%2F1594200823%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1171040122%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Omnivore's Dilemma</a> (me) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FYou-Gotta-Have-Robert-Whiting%2Fdp%2F067972947X%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1171040187%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">You Gotta Have Wa</a> (Al).</li>

<p>
Yeah, baby! We're totally rockin' the new schedule.

<h3 class="title">Complex</h3>

<p>
Overheard from downstairs just this moment: "I found my black Jeep, Aura!"
</p>

<p>
I mention this because it sounded SO CUTE to my ears, and also because I've been noticing lately how much more accurately the Beaner is describing things&#8212;even before the doctor mentioned last Friday, with some surprise, that she could understand everything he was saying, and before we had our interview at the Montessori school at which we were asked whether the Beaner spoke in simple or complex sentences.
</p>

<p>
He's using articles, adjectives, and other modifiers more frequently now. He doesn't just say, "what happened to penis?" anymore (and I am including the actual word here instead of substituting p____, as I normally do, because nothing CRACKS ME UP quite so much as thinking of the Beaner asking this question in his usual "what happened to...?" tone of half-excitement, half-alarm, and I wanted to share my amusement with you); he says, "what happened to my penis?"... and, somewhat sadly, the addition of the word "my" makes it sound like a normal question anyone would ask. Not nearly as funny, but I try to remind myself that it's an indication of development on the language front.
</p>

<p>
Of course he also asks about and identifies other items as well, often being very explicit about which thing he means in the process. "What happened to my blue cup?" It's in the dishwasher, I think. "What happened to my blue DORA cup?," he'll clarify. Oh, that's over here. "I like Jeeps. I like Jeeps and Saabs. Where's our Saab, the big one?" (This last point of clarification is necessary because he has several toy Saabs, and I'll go looking for those unless I understand that he means the Saab that we drive around in.) Appropos of nothing, he'll sometimes tell us what he's doing or where he is. "{The Beaner}'s in the car. In the back seat of the big Saab. That Mommy and Daddy up there. Daddy's driving. Mommy not driving."
</p>

<p>
My favorite language moments, however, are the ones in which he's being polite. The ones where he recognizes the difference between "I want" and "I need", and especially between "I like" and "I *would* like". "I'd like some tapioca, please" has never sounded so sweet.

<h3 class="title">Out My Window</h3>

<p>
It's snowing today in Philadelphia. For some reason I'm not thinking of coziness and cocoa, probably because my mind is firmly in March, not February. I did appreciate the near-silent <em>hush</em> of my boots in the snow as I walked to Trader Joe's to pick up some essentials this morning, however, and I'm appreciating the snowy view outside my window right now. In fact, I've raised the somewhat-transparent sunshade on the window for the first time in months so I'd be able to see the individual flakes falling.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Upgrade Time</h3>

<p>
Hey gang&#8212; I'm having a few troubles with Movable Type that I think might be related to the size of the database (I have well over 2000 entries in this blog alone, not to mention all the other blogs and the comments on each) and the fact that I'm still using Berkeley DB. I'm going to try two things to ensure the long-term health of all my MT blogs: (1) upgrading to MT 3.34, and (2) converting from Berkeley to MySQL. Hopefully both operations will be successful, and you won't notice anything different.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, access may be wonky for a little while, and it's possible that something could go HORRIBLY WRONG, resulting in all the blogs being offline until I can sort out what, exactly, to do about it. Cross your fingers that everything goes smoothly.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Step 1 Completed!</h3>

<p>
OK, step 1 in the upgrade process is finally complete: I've moved from Berkeley DB to MySQL. While doing this, I discovered a couple things:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The 2000+ entries are for all blogs total, not just this one.</li>
<li>There's a bug in MT 3.2 such that junk comments and trackbacks were not being deleted every 5 days, as I'd specified in my settings.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Because of #2, I had trouble converting my databases, and that's how I discovered #1 (which isn't a problem at all, really). It turns out that #2 is probably the reason I've been having trouble with MT bogging down&#8212;and showing a blank page after completing any operation. There were THOUSANDS upon THOUSANDS of junk comments and trackbacks in my databases, and I had to delete practically all of them by hand, 75-125 at a time, because of the aforementioned blank page problem&#8212;a process that took all day (partly because I was doing it between work tasks). Once the junk was all cleared out, however, I was able to convert my databases successfully, and hopefully MT will be more responsive. This post is the first test of the new setup.
</p>

<p>
Next up: Upgrading from MT 3.2 to MT 3.34. Maybe tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update: </strong>Yes! It's speedier! No more blank pages! YIPPPEEEE!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Newsworthy</h3>

<p>
Al and I cannot stand the local news. We do not want to hear the gory details of all the murders, rapes, drive-by shootings, hit-and-run accidents, and drug transactions that afflict Philadelphia. We hate the hyperbole, the non-news, the on-location reporting when being on-location adds absolutely nothing (look, here's a shot of the street where the water main broke! you can't see anything now, but a few hours ago there was water here!).
</p>

<p>
That said, I have just set the TiVo to record the local news (channel 6) tonight from 5:00pm to 6:30pm. Why? Because <strong>the Beaner will be featured in a non-news story about the refurbishment of the boat river at the Please Touch Museum</strong>. Apparently they needed a kid to push the very first boat down the newly-refurbished river as part of a press event announcing Aqua's sponsorship of said refurbishment (as well as of the building of an even better water feature at the new Please Touch Museum at Memorial Hall, coming soon). The woman in charge of the press event approached Aura and asked if the Beaner would be the boat-pusher. She said yes with glee, and then called me for my OK when they presented her with a photography/film release to sign. After talking with the woman in charge, I gave the thumbs up.
</p>

<p>
So anyway, my kid will be on the news tonight. The person you may or may not see lurking behind him will be Aura, not me (because I am home WORKING, not blogging or budgeting or anything else not work-related). If you're local and have any inclination to see the Beaner in action, may I suggest you do as we are doing and TiVo the news, so you don't actually have to <em>watch</em> it. You can just scan for his cuteness, watch the Please Touch segment, and then delete the whole shebang without even watching the weather report. Woo!
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update: </strong>They didn't run the segment, so now I'm happier than ever that I TiVo'ed the 90 minutes worth of traffic, weather, and manufactured drama instead of watching it live. The goody bag the Beaner received as part of the press hoo-hah was reward enough for his time in front of the camera, too&#8212;it contained a plastic sailboat and squeezy tug boat for playing with in the tub (now shower!), stickers, a MARACA (which I think is brilliant even if it *is* rather loud), bandaids, and a bunch of other random stuff.

<h3 class="title">School Days</h3>

<p>
Just wanted to let anyone who was holding their breath in suspense know that the Beaner was accepted at the Montessori school for this fall. We are still trying to figure out all the things we need to commit to/pay for/sign in the coming days, but we're thrilled. I really think he's going to love it.

<h3 class="title">Why and Other Words</h3>

<p>
You know the pilot episode of Lucky Louie that <a href="http://www.fussy.org/2006/07/genius.html">Mrs. Kennedy wrote about (transcribed, actually)</a> way back in July? We saw that episode (or at least that opening scene) when it aired, and neither Al nor I found it funny. We found it annoying. Well, guess what? THAT SCENE IS NOW MY LIFE. The Beaner's favorite phrase used to be &quot;what happened?&quot;, which could be annoying enough when repeated. But while &quot;what happened&quot; is still in rotation, it's been replaced at #1 by WHY? And not just one WHY?, but several, repeated after every answer a la that scene in Lucky Louie.</p>


<p>This will not be a surprise to any parent with a child older than 5 or so; if you've made it that far, you've already been through the endless WHY stage, and you're probably smirking right now. Heck, you probably found the Lucky Louie scene hi-fucking-larious. What I do find somewhat amusing about it is that Al takes the questioning as a parental challenge and answers each successive WHY with more and more detail&#8212;essentially re-enacting the Lucky Louie scene over and over on a daily basis. I do it too, to a certain extent, though at some point I usually cut the Beaner off with a BECAUSE. </p>
<p>At the mall the other day I actually had the temerity to ignore three WHYs in a row, and when the fourth one came, I responded with BECAUSE BECAUSE BECAUSE BECAUSE. Which The Beaner found hilarious, and so a game of WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY...BECAUSE BECAUSE BECAUSE BECAUSE BECAUSE ensued. If I forgot my line, the Beaner would prompt me: &quot;No, {Beaner} says, 'WHY WHY WHY...' and then Mommy says, 'BECAUSE BECAUSE BECAUSE...'.&quot;</p>
<p>It can sometimes be fun to try to come up with enough detail to answer each successive WHY, so the question isn't *always* annoying. What *is* annoying is when the whole WHY set gets repeated, as in:</p>
<p>&quot;Mommy, whatchu doin'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unloading the dishwasher.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;WHY?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because the dishes are clean, and I need to put them away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;WHY?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because I need to make room for the dirty dishes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;WHY?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because I don't want them clogging up the sink.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;WHY?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;BECAUSE.&quot;</p>
<p>[10 second pause]</p>
<p>&quot;Mommy, whatchu doin'?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm unloading the dishwasher.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;WHY?&quot;</p>
<p>And so on. After the third round of the same questions and the same answers, when he asked, &quot;Mommy, whatchu doin'?&quot;, I said, YOU TELL ME. And he did... but then he said, WHY?, and I replied, MOMMY ALREADY TOLD YOU WHY. Which of course I came to regret. He spent the rest of the day saying WHY? and then, before I could fully form a response, answering his own question with MOMMY ALREADY TOLD YOU WHY. &quot;Uh, Beaner? No I didn't. Not this time.&quot;</p>
<p>WHY isn't the only new word around here. He now answers requests with &quot;sure&quot; or &quot;sure thing&quot;. He's started using the word &quot;also&quot; properly&#8212;as in, &quot;Mommy putting on her coat? I  put on my coat also.&quot; Aura mentioned that she'd heard him use the word &quot;though&quot;, and then sure enough, I heard him say it the next day. Last night Al said to him, while we were eating Korean food for dinner, &quot;you didn't like that pork dumpling?&quot; The Beaner replied, &quot;No. The rice is good, though.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes I can carry on such detailed, grown-up-like conversations with him that I forget he's only two. I'm brought back to reality when he answers WHAT. to perfectly reasonable questions, like &quot;do you remember why you were crying last night?&quot; (Not WHAT?, but WHAT.) Oh, and remember how I said I wasn't sure whether the requests to pee and poop at bedtime reflected progress on the toilet-training front or precocious procratistination? (No? Hm, maybe I never said it out blog.) Anyway, it's a little of both. He's become a total CHAMP at the potty. Even when he had a bit of a stomach virus last weekend, he managed to tell me BEFORE he had to go *and* wait for a stall big enough for the two of us to open up. (At the ski slope we visited last weekend, everyone coveted the handicap stall because it was the only one big enough to turn around in.) We don't have to ask him if he has to pee constantly because he tells us when he has to go.</p>
<p>Oh, but what I was about to talk about was the precocious procrastination. Last night, as usual, he announced that he had to pee after we'd been in bed snuggling for 15 minutes already. I sighed heavily and said OK, let's go to the bathroom then. We marched down the hall, I helped him off with his Pull-Up (we've switched from regular Huggies to Pull-Ups at night mainly because of this &quot;I need to poop|pee&quot; drama; Pull-Ups are easier to get on and off), and then I stood him in front of the toilet. He waited a couple seconds and then turned his head, the first sign that he's about to announce, &quot;I don't have to pee.&quot; Instead, he started peeing&#8212;and exclaimed in surprise, &quot;Oh! I *did* have to pee!&quot; So there you have it: evidence that the nightly trips to the bathroom are more about procrastination than keeping his diaper dry. (Although he does keep his diaper dry about 5 nights out of 7. He's actually starting to wake in the middle of the night occasionally just because he has to pee.)</p>
<p>Let's see... oh yes, one more thing: He's finally started to get the concept of you vs. me. At least half the time he now says, &quot;Grandpa got this for me&quot; instead of &quot;Grandpa got this for you.&quot; He practices sometimes, pointing at me and saying &quot;you&quot;, and then at himself and saying &quot;me&quot;. OK wait, that wasn't the last thing, this is: When his dad brought a corn dog for him down to the basement playroom (which is walled in mirrors because it used to be the previous owner's body-building gym) this afternoon, he said, &quot;Daddy got me a corn dog,&quot; to me, and then he turned to the mirror and addressed himself: &quot;{Beaner}, look! A corn dog!&quot; And then he did a little dance of joy.

<h3 class="title">Exit, Stage Right</h3>

<p>
The Beaner is a total ham who, like all kids his age, is very aware of the camera. He's particularly fond of the Finepix and its large LCD screen (the Canon 10D is a little less interesting because there's nothing to see until after you're done shooting&#8212;which suits me just fine), and I think he appreciates the Finepix most for the same reason we do: it takes great little videos.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/393474509/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/182/393474509_c917778b2b_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="watching himself" /></a>
</p>

<p>
The first scene of practically every video I or Al shoot of the Beaner shows him reaching for the camera and saying earnestly, "I wanna see it!" It's become like the roaring lion at the beginning of MGM movies, except that I usually edit it out because I'm trying to capture some other moment, not the same one over and over. In the video below, I edited it out of the beginning (it was, again, the opening scene), but I left it in when he did it again at the end because it kind of made sense there (by that time, there was actually something to see).
</p>

<p>
So without further ado, I present to you "Exit, Stage Right".

<h3 class="title">The Work Dreams Have Started</h3>

<p>
How you know you're in "crunch mode" at work: Even when you're sleeping, you're working.
</p>

<p>
Last night the Beaner woke in the wee hours (I actually have no idea what time it was), went to the gate at his door, and cried loudly enough to wake one of us (this time it was me, but often it's Al. Funny how usually only one of us at a time ever hears him...). I went up to take him to the bathroom, and after spritzing a bit into the toilet, he reached for me to pick him up, and then he clung to my neck like a monkey when I tried to put him back in bed. I think he wanted to make sure I got the message that he wanted me to get in, too, which I did.
</p>

<p>
<em>Aside: Man, am I glad I put the good (read: beech fiber) sheets on his bed this time. It made falling back to sleep so much easier. Those sheets ROCK.</em>
</p>

<p>
So anyway, I fell asleep with the Beaner snuggling/smothering me, and I immediately went back to work. I seemed to be in the office, which is odd because in real life I work from home, three timezones removed from most of my colleagues. I was dreaming about quarterly goals; apparently I got two different sets of goals confused and turned in the wrong kind (yearly instead of quarterly, maybe?). At some point I realized I was sleeping, woke myself up, and tried to sneak out of the bed, but the Beaner caught and tackled me.
</p>

<p>
I fell back to sleep right away again, and went right back to the office. I was talking to some colleagues about the fact that my boss' boss was moving back to his home town, and how he'd only be in the office every other week now. One of the QEs said she'd miss him because he injected some sexiness into the office (and the team meetings). In the dream I totally knew what she was referring to, and I remember wondering if this type of injection was appropriate. 
</p>

<p>
Next thing I knew I was reading an e-mail from a QE with whom I work closely; in it she mentioned that the boss' boss had made a remark to her in the hall and grabbed her butt once. I wasn't able to read her tone, however, and I was unable to discern whether she was flattered by the attention or considered it sexual harrassment. I was also unsure why she was telling <em>me</em> about the incident. Just then the boss' boss arrived to say goodbye, and he gave me a "special" goodbye hug. It seemed a little... well... <em>affectionate</em>, especially when he nuzzled my neck.
</p>

<p>
That's when I opened my eyes to find the Beaner half sprawled across me, with his face very close to mine. He smiled, and suddenly I was home. 
</p>

<h3 class="title">Celebrity Thai</h3>

<p>
 A few decisions Al and I made in the past month (namely, to put the Beaner to bed at a regular, earlier time each night;  to spend less money on frivolous things; and not to sit in traffic needlessly) have meant that we've been eating out less lately. Probably the colder weather also has something to do with it, as we're  less inclined to walk to restaurants in the dark when it's 20 degrees out. We've been eating pretty well from the pantry and supplementing with a few key ingredients from Trader Joe's, which means we've been able to stick to our schedule and our budget.
</p>


<p>
Tonight, however, we decided to go out for a meal. I was craving pizza but didn't want to drive to New Jersey to visit King of Pizza (both because it would violate the 'sitting in traffic needlessly' rule and because I was craving a different kind of pizza), and below-freezing temperatures and stiff winds meant a walk to that coal oven place on Walnut was out, too. When you don't want to drive, don't want to walk, and especially don't want to walk with the stroller, eating out can be tough. Eating in was tricky, too, since we weren't in the mood for any of our delivery regulars. 
</p>
<p>
I finally hit on the idea of driving to Manayunk. It'd be driving, yes, but against traffic. It'd probably mean paying for parking, true (which would negate any bridge toll savings), but we'd have several restaurant choices, and we could get in a little walk without having to take the stroller. The universe smiled on this idea by giving us street parking and a table at Chabaa Thai Bistro without a reservation. (Wait, what happened to the pizza craving? Well, once Manayunk came to mind, I knew I'd jump at the chance to have Thai fried rice with shrimp if it were in the offing. And if it weren't, I was sure we could find a pizza place.)
</p>

</p>

<p>
We ended up sharing a YUMMY, YUMMY meal of fried rice, Pad Thai with tofu, Tom Yum, and a fried tofu appetizer that was meant for the Beaner but which I and Al ate most of. The Beaner loved the rice, the noodles, the &quot;pickles&quot; (i.e., cucumber slices), and especially the shrimp. He tried the soup but immediately made a very sad face and said, &quot;I don't like the soup, Mommy! I DON'T LIKE THE SOUP!&quot; When I tasted it for myself, I realized why: like all tom yum, it had a strong lemongrass and kefir lime flavor, but this one was also spicier than most. It had a serious kick. As a bonus, the first serving of soup they brought us was made with tofu instead of shrimp, and when Al mentioned the error, the waitress asked if we wanted to wrap up the tofu version and take it home. &quot;They're just going to throw it out anyway,&quot; she explained. We said sure. (Yay, lunch for tomorrow!)

</p>

<p>
The Beaner was very well behaved during dinner, thanks to my handy Finepix, with which I entertained him until the food came, and to the food itself once it arrived. He knelt in his own seat (as usual) with a cloth napkin tucked into the front of his shirt and happily fed himself. Dinners out are so much nicer when there's no Beaner-wrangling involved, I must say. It's possible that dinner out seemed special to him, too, after so many meals at home lately.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The bonus of the evening (as if great food, free parking, no traffic, and a well-behaved two year-old were not enough!) was that as I was putting on my coat and gathering our doggie bags, a really cute woman came over and said, &quot;Lori?&quot; (At this point Al and the Beaner were already downstairs.) I'm afraid I stared blankly at her for a moment, possibly with my head cocked to one side, until she introduced herself as <a href="http://www.girl-fiend.com/">Girlfiend</a>. I said &quot;oh, HI!,&quot; of course, and then I asked, &quot;am I that recognizable? Or was it him?&quot; (and here I pointed to the chair that had, until recently, been occupied by the Beaner). She said she was pretty sure when she saw us that it WAS us, &quot;you know, with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/">Flickr</a> and all.&quot; I remembered that she'd commented on <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/11/a_thai_goodbye.html">my previous post about Chabaa</a>, but I hadn't put two and two together when she'd said it was her &quot;favorite restaurant in the neighborhood&quot; and deduced that she actually lived in Manayunk. In any case, I thought it was incredibly cool that she came up and introduced herself. I love meeting people I only know online; it's fun to put faces and mannerisms together with online personalities. (Sometimes they match, sometimes they don't.)  Girlfiend, I hope to run into you again sometime&#8212;maybe even on purpose! Oh, and I love your hair. :)

<h3 class="title">Cramped and Upset</h3>

<p>
 I actually have a lump in my throat right now and feel ready to cry... over <em>mouse software</em>. It's bad enough that MouseWorks, the software that drives my beloved Kensington Expert Mouse, conflicts with the Acrobat Connect Add-In (which I need for work). Now Logitech's MouseWare is conflicting with an application that I also need to use for work. In this case it's not causing the application to crash, as MouseWorks caused the Add-In to do, but it's severely impacting my workflow.
</p>

<p>
The solution is to &quot;upgrade&quot; to the new Logitech SetPoint software, which is TOTALLY USELESS for my purposes because it won't let me program my left mouse button to be double-click. The left and right mouse buttons MUST be single click and right-click (or vice versa) in SetPoint world, which doesn't work for me at all. Here's where I want to cry, and I realize that perhaps it's not clear why. Let me 'splain:
</p>
<p>
I moved to the beloved Expert Mouse several years ago, after going through weeks of physical therapy for RSI. I tried braces, exercises, massage, everything&#8212;but nothing stuck because I'd just make the tendonitis worse every time I got back behind my desk. One day the rehab doctor sighed and said, &quot;your physical therapist has written to say that she doesn't think further therapy will produce any more improvement. The only other thing I can suggest is maybe moving to a trackball.&quot; I was like, WHY DIDN'T YOU MENTION THIS BEFORE??? I went out and got the Expert Mouse, and damned if he wasn't right: not having to double-click was HEAVEN. Not having to hold down a button while dragging? HOW COULD LIFE BE SO SWEET? My tendonitis still reared its head whenever I had to work sans mouse (i.e., using just the laptop trackpad), but whenever I had the Expert Mouse plugged in, I could work for hours on end without any trouble. It was weird to have the tendonitis improve <em>while I was working</em>.
</p>
<p>
Fast-forward to the discovery of the Add-In conflict. The engineer who finally diagnosed the problem suggested I try the Logitech Marble Mouse; he said that's the one he switched to when he realized the Kensington software was causing the Add-In crashes. I didn't love it, I must admit. The Expert mouse just fits my hand better, and the buttons are positioned so that they cause the least possible stress in my hand, wrist, and arm. The Marble Mouse's trackball is too far forward, and the buttons aren't positioned well for my hand, but at least I could program the buttons. See where this is going? NOW I CAN'T. My options are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Continue to use SetPoint, and try to get used to one of the tiny interior buttons being double-click. I can't seem to get used to the right mouse button being right-click, so I've swapped it with the left mouse button... but that means my left button is now right-click. That's not intuitive, either. I'm also having trouble reaching that tiny interior button without contorting my hand.</li>
  <li>Go back to the old MouseWare and have the buttons programmed the way I want them (or rather, the way I've settled for, after having to give up the Expert Mouse), but have the double-click button not work in an application I use EVERY DAY.</li>
  <li>Go back to the Expert Mouse and avoid using Acrobat Connect on this machine for as long as I can. (Mostly I use Acrobat Connect on my Mac, but for situations where *I* need to demo something or discuss code with another engineer, I need to use it here on my PC. In those situations, I'd need to uninstall the MouseWorks software first.)</li>
</ol>
<p>
I'm not thrilled with any of these options. #1 and #2 guarantee physical pain. (I'm actually already cramped up in my hand and elbow from the past couple days' worth going the #2 route, and less than an hour of route #1 has sent me in search of ice and Advil.) #3 will be a hassle beyond belief. But right now? I think I'm going to opt for the hassle over the pain. Hopefully that'll keep me from crying, too.
</p>
