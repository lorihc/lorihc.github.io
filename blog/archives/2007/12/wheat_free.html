<h3 class="title">Wheat Free</h3>

<p>
I don't intend to eat wheat-free forever (in fact, I ate the three of the croutons off the Beaner's bowl of roasted tomato soup at the Corner Bakery Cafe today), but other than those croutons, I've spent the past two days avoiding wheat and overt sugars. I did it for two reasons: (1) because I seemed to be in a state of sugar shock, where even small amounts of bread or sugar could give me the sugar sweats and make me feel terrible, and (2) in an effort to eat more consciously. I have a habit of just stuffing things in my mouth while I've got my nose an inch away from the computer screen, and then wondering, "did I just eat something? If so, what?"
</p>
<p>
Anyway, while at the grocery store last night I happened to peruse the "natural foods" section to see if I could spot any wheat-free crackers. I'd just picked up some more drunken goat cheese (yum!), and IMHO, it tastes best on a cracker. I spotted <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAlmond-Nut-Thins-Smokehouse-Gluten%2Fdp%2FB000F6PPZE%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dgourmet-food%26qid%3D1196888211%26sr%3D1-2&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">these</a> on the bottom shelf, and after some indecision over whether to get the pecan or the almond variety, I threw a box in my cart:
</p>

<p class="pictureP noborder">
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAlmond-Nut-Thins-Smokehouse-Gluten%2Fdp%2FB000F6PPZE%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dgourmet-food%26qid%3D1196888211%26sr%3D1-2&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325"><img alt="nut-thins.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/nut-thins.jpg" width="220" height="220" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I actually got the non-Smokehouse almond version (because they were out of the Smokehouse version), and they're delicious. They're a bit like Asian rice crackers, but with a better flavor&#8212;and they're perfect under the drunken goat cheese. Highly recommended, even if you aren't on a wheat-free diet.

<p>
In addition to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAlmond-Nut-Thins-Smokehouse-Gluten%2Fdp%2FB000F6PPZE%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dgourmet-food%26qid%3D1196888211%26sr%3D1-2&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Smokehouse almond flavor</a>, Amazon also carries the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAlmond-Nut-Thins-Cheddar-Cheese%2Fdp%2FB000F6RNRW%2F&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">cheddar cheese almond</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPecan-Nut-Thins-Wheat-Gluten%2Fdp%2FB000F6UB58&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">pecan</a> varieties. Your local store may carry the <a href="http://www.bluediamond.com/shop/natural/nutThins.cfm">hazelnut flavor</a> as well; Wegmans did.

<p>Ahhh, the Corner Bakery's tomato soup...I adore it! In fact, I'm going to be downtown this afternoon (a place I don't frequent too much anymore) and believe I'll have to indulge.</p>
