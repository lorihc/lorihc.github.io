<h3 class="title">iTunes Meme: The "Home" Mac</h3>

<p>
Finally made it downstairs to the "home" Mac, where the main iTunes account (which I share with Al and the Beaner) is. Here's the scoop:
</p>
<p>
<strong>How many total songs?</strong><br />
5184 songs. 13.7 days worth.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sort by song title - First and Last…</strong><br />
Abblasen: Fanfare - Chip Davis<br />
. - Stevie Wonder (This isn't the actual song title; it's where the Beaner hit . and Enter on the keyboard once, and we lost the actual song title. I've been too lazy to dig out the Sesame Street CD it came from to see what it really is.)<br />
1999 - Seahorses (The last actual song title.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sort by Time - Shortest and Longest…</strong><br />
Bonus Track - Ani DiFranco, 4 seconds<br />
It took me a while to determine this, since Cast, Nirvana, Kula Shaker, and the Stone Roses all have songs with a huge amount of dead air at the end of them. I think the winner for actual longest song is:<br />
St. Robinson In His Cadillac Dreams - Counting Crows, 15:40
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sort by Album - First and Last…</strong><br />
A. Marcello - Alessandro Marcello<br />
1989 Keep On Movin' - Soul II Soul, and here we run into the "FIRST!" dorkwad problem again. Last real album title is 5 - Lenny Kravitz
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sort by Artist - First and Last…</strong><br />
a-Ha<br />
999
</p>

<p>
<strong>Top Five Most Played Songs…</strong><br />
Sleigh Ride - Johnny Mathis With Percy Faith And His Orchestra (211)<br />
Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box - Radiohead (202)<br />
Go to Sleep - Radiohead (194)<br />
True Dreams Of Wichita - Soul Coughing (184)<br />
Destroy This World - Five-Eight (172)
</p>

<p>
Note that although I do love Sleigh Ride, it wouldn't be in the top five if it weren't also the Beaner's favorite song of all time. We've been known to put it on a single-song loop for him. The remaining four are all on my Moody series of playlists (II-VI), which *I* put loop when I'm coding.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Find the following words. How many songs show up?</strong><br />
Sex: 6, Death: 326*, Love: 83, You: 229, Home: 19, Boy: 64, Girl: 78<br />
<span class="footnote">*323 of these are Harry Potter audiobook chapters</span>
</p>

<p>
<strong>First five songs that come up on Party Shuffle…</strong><br />
The Guns Of Brixton - The Clash	Story of the Clash (Alternative & Punk)<br />
Voices Carry - 'Til Tuesday (Rock)<br />
Glycerine - Bush (Rock)<br />
Southside - Moby (Electronica/Dance)<br />
Begin The Begin - R.E.M. (Rock)	
</p>

<p>
Not a bad mix, actually. As I was doing this, I noted to Al that there are probably some more interesting questions that could be asked that would elicit more hilarity as well as more diversity (Abbey Road seems to be coming up a lot as a first album, a-Ha as an artist, for example). Al thought of two things he'd like to know: Since the "sex" and "death" keywords came up relatively little for me&#8212;death was 0 on the work machine, and 3 on the home machine if you exclude all the Harry Potter&#8212;he wondered what keywords *did* show up rather frequently. I'd probably have to write a program to determine this. Also not as simple as sorting by column header: Top Five Artists by Number of Tracks. iWantToKnowMore: How about some iTunes analysis tools, Apple?

<p>I noticed that! When I saw that 999 came up as your last, I figured it would on my iTunes, too, because I knew I had a couple 999 tracks on there.</p>

<p>Thanks for playing, Sho! I was excited to see your list, since your music knowledge (and your music collection) is much more extensive and eclectic than mine.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about the Breeders a lot lately -- perhaps it was because another blogger's version of the iTunes meme also mentioned them? -- and wondering where the CD I had in the early 90s got to. Maybe it was a cassette? I should try to hunt that down...</p>

<p>We're all great! </p>
