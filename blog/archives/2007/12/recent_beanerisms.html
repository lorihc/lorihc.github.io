<h3 class="title">Recent Beanerisms</h3>

<p>
Beaner, to me: &quot;Where's my macaroni and cheese? Where's my corn?&quot;
</p>
<p>
Me, to Al: &quot;<a href="http://www.audiosparx.com/sa/archive/People/Children-sounds/All-I-want-is-whats-coming-to-me/17337">All I want is what I have coming to me. All I want is my fair share.</a>&quot; 
</p>

<p>
Al, to me: &quot;That's exactly the quote that popped into my head, too.&quot;
</p>
<p class="sep">&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Boys like Mommies and sisters like Daddies. That means you need to drive and Daddy nees to sit in the passenger seat.&quot;
</p>
<p>
I think his logic is faulty and he's been watching to many Berenstein Bears episodes. (Al, while watching the Berenstein Bears with the Beaner in our hotel room in Harrisburg: &quot;Are these bears Mormon?&quot;) I've no idea why the Beaner prefers me to drive; it's taken a while for me to come to terms with this, but Al is the better driver. I've become more nervous and paranoid behind the wheel over the years. I am a heck of a navigator, though (more reliable than the GPS, even. :)
</p>
<p class="sep">&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Beaner: &quot;Why are your sunglasses there?&quot;
</p>
<p>
Me: &quot;Because they were in my hockey bag and I took them out.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Beaner: &quot;But why are they there?&quot;
</p>
<p>
Me, exasperated that he still hasn't taken his jacket off after being asked three times: &quot;Because I put them there. You know, sometimes things just ARE.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Beaner: &quot;Oh, right, like a pirate. [pause] Arrrr!&quot;

<p>The pirate one made me laugh. Though if I wanted some mac & cheese, I'd like it in front of me as soon as possible, as well. </p>

<p>The irony with these things is most of the time, you really CAN'T LAUGH, as that just encourages his inner entertainer -- and then his jacket will never get hung up. :-)</p>
