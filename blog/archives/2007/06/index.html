<h3 class="title">Well Spent</h3>

<p>
I should know better. I often extol the virtues of a workday that might include a trip to the dry cleaners when I'm feeling unproductive, and a late night of fixing bugs when I'm on a roll. I also often request that I not be congratulated as a "hard worker" for being online at 11pm; just as some people get sleepy at 3pm, I tend to get a third wind after 10. (I usually get the second at about 5pm, fwiw.)
</p>

<p>
And yet, I've found myself depressed over the past three days as the meticulous schedule of 30- to 60-minute blocks I drew up for myself went totally out the window. The problem is that my work to-do list started outpacing my (considerable) personal to-do list, and I got nervous that I'd never actually *finish* anything or be prepared for my next meeting (especially the one I lead)&#8212;hence the schedule. The problem is that this just isn't how I work. Nothing got *done* on Wednesday, and yet lots of things moved forward. I didn't fix any bugs, as scheduled, but I did catch up on a bunch of other things... and I set myself up for finishing a few things on Thursday (including two things that came up at the last minute, and thus weren't on the schedule).
</p>

<p>
I think the trick is to stay flexible, keep the list of things I'm responsible for front-and-center where I can see them (and thus know what my options are when I'm looking for something to do&#8212;because right now scanning blogs and Flickr is the default, when fixing a bug or doing a build or writing a presentation should be), and not worry too much if I spend a little time daydreaming and get off my schedule. Also? Don't automatically say, "ok, sure" whenever someone suggests me for a task. It may be flattering that I'm at the top of so many lists, but if I want to stay there, I have to be able to deliver on the tasks I'm given&#8212;and I can't do that if I'm completely buried under them.
</p>

<p>
What got me thinking about all this is the now-totally-shot-to-hell schedule, of course, but also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/fashion/31work.html?ex=1338350400&en=d5a0793d6d4dcf12&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink" title="Time Wasted? Perhaps Itâ€™s Well Spent">this article in the New York Times</a> that I happened upon while, um, reading blogs in my RSS feed. OK, you got me.

<h3 class="title">The Video Onslaught Begins</h3>

<p>
Between hockey and the Beaner, I have about a gazillion videos (and some audio, too) to share with y'all. Most of Beaner videos are a few weeks old, though if I get completely caught up, I'll have some from today to post, too. This first one is from the weekend that my mom and dad came up; my dad left on Sunday, but my mom stayed until Tuesday morning so she could fill in for a vacationing nanny on Monday. (My company now offers backup care with a really low co-payment, a benefit we took advantage of on Thursday and loved because we got a great temporary nanny, but having mom help us out this time seemed like a good idea. It would give us a chance to go out to mother's day brunch together, and it would give the Beaner extra time with his grandma.)
</p>


<p>
So anyway, the video. We have a long driveway that we share with four of our neighbors; most of us pull forward into our garages and then back out of the driveway onto a rather busy street. Al and I think of it as a relatively normal operation (even in a car without backup lights&#8212;we need to get those fixed!), but for visitors it can be a bit hair-raising. I think my dad probably would have been OK backing out on his own, but it made my mom nervous, so she did a little directing... with the Beaner on her hip.

<h3 class="title">That Was Too Far, Daddy</h3>

<p>
Al likes to give the Beaner some room to roam, but he has a mental line that causes him to call, &quot;that's too far, buddy!&quot; I think it seems gentler to him to say &quot;that's too far&quot; than to shout, &quot;{Beaner}, come back here!&quot; as many a panicked parent would (and I sometimes) do.
</p>

<p>
A couple weekends ago we had walked to the bakery to buy some bread, and on the way back we went through Rittenhouse Square. At this point the Beaner was walking, Al was pushing the empty stroller, and I was taking photos of Al, the Beaner, and anything else that looked interesting (as usual). Al started to play a game of &quot;chase me&quot;, and took off with the stroller. The Beaner had a panicked child moment, and ran after Al, waving his arms. Here's the clip:

<h3 class="title">Jump In!</h3>

<p>
I've been waffling about posting the videos Al took of me and the Beaner in the hotel pool because in most of them I am so obviously giving Al a horrified look..and then giving my body an even more horrified once-over. I seem to be saying, entirely with my eyes/facial expression, &quot;Jesus Christ, I'm in my bathing suit!&quot; and &quot;good lord, is anything incriminating hanging out?&quot; The swimming videos are worse than the jumping-in-the-pool video, so I'll start with the latter.

I've been talking with a couple friends about this over e-mail and via Flickr comments recently, but I can't remember whether I've mentioned it here: After all the floating around and jumping in hotel pools we did on our latest vacation&#8212;and the avid interest the Beaner has shown in learning to swim (I wish I had video from the Vancouver hotel pool, as he was even more adventurous there)&#8212;I'm thinking it's time for swim lessons. The hard part is going to be finding a place that offers them to kids under 3 at a time when Al or I can take him...

<h3 class="title">Two and a Half</h3>

<p>
I pretty much abandoned the Beaner updates around the time said Beaner turned two, and I've kinda regretted that. I've said it before, but this blog, in addition to being my place to rant about random political/news/media issues and rhapsodize about food, is our baby book. It's where most of the milestones have been recorded&#8212;with context that's often missing in an actual baby book. Partly I stopped with the updates because between work, hockey, and the actual raising of the kid, it was hard to keep up; and partly I stopped because the Beaner is much more a participant in events now rather than just a curiosity to be studied. Still, it makes me kinda sad not to have a (detailed) record of all the things he's learned and done over the past six months.
</p>

<p>
Yes, that's  right: A half a year has passed since his second birthday. We've explained this to him, that he can say, &quot;I'm TWO AND A HALF!&quot; now instead of &quot;I'm TWO!&quot;, though technically he is still two and not three, so &quot;I'm TWO!&quot; still works. (When we were in Vancouver he tried to convince me that he'd already turned three, but I wasn't buying it.) I often forget that he's only two and a half, actually, perhaps because the labels on his clothes tell me that he's 4. He's not particularly tall&#8212;in fact, he seems to be holding steady at between 36&quot; and 37&quot;&#8212;but on the morning of May 27th I found that I wasn't able to button any of his size 3T pants or shorts, and we had to make an emergency run to the Children's Place store at the Brentwood Mall in Burnaby. (Luckily Al had bought a mix of 3T and 4T shorts prior to our Hawaii trip in March &quot;just in case&quot;, and we had a one of the 4T pairs with us.)
</p>
<p>
He still wears mostly 3T shirts, but the size XS (2-4) t-shirts that used to be huge on him now fit just right or even a little tightly. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, really, as he moved into 4T pajamas, which fit more snugly than regular clothes, a few months ago. I suspect it won't be long before the size S (4-6) t-shirt his new school sent him as a welcome gift will fit.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of the school, Al and I went to a parent orientation last week, where we learned about day-to-day operations, got to fondle a few Montessori materials, and learned about how much they expected us to participate as Parents. It's weird that I'm now a Parent with a capital P... I was saying to M's mom that school not only separates you from your child physically, but categorically. I am now part of a larger class called Parents. We briefly met other Parents of children who will be joining either the toddler or primary programs at the school, though we didn't really get to interact with them. We will over the course of the school year (which starts at the end of August), however, at a series of Parent Potlucks and by participating in various Parent-led committees. If I sound sad or cynical, I don't mean to be; I'm very excited for the Beaner to attend school, because I think he's going to LOVE it. I'm just realizing that he's not the only one who'll be thrown into a whole new world.
</p>
<p>
I'm sure there are milestones associated with two and a half, but I'm not really sure what they are. I suspect that most things are subjective from here on out, and we'll only really hear about official milestones if he lags behind far enough to raise eyebrows. Just to give a snapshot (more for my own later reference than to prove a point or even&#8212;gasp!&#8212;<em>brag</em>), these are the skills and interests I associate with the Beaner right now, in not particularly parallel bullet points:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Still into identifying cars. He won't point out EVERY make and model anymore, but he'll say more about the ones he does point out. For example, tonight he pointed at a Toyota Highlander and said, &quot;hey, that's just like OUR car that we had last week! In Vancouver!&quot; Or, &quot;there's a Saab 9-5 wagon, just like grandma's! Except grandma's is white, and that one is silver! But grandma's has silver wheels, though.&quot;</li>
<li>LOVES other kids, and introducing himself to them. &quot;Look! There are some KIDS!&quot; he'll say, if he spots some within a block of wherever we are. He now pronounces his name very clearly, and he asks other kids what their names and ages are. He knows that he's going to school this fall, and he can't wait because that's where the KIDS go.</li>
<li>Favorite phrase of the moment: &quot;Because I'm not a baby anymore. I'm a big boy now.&quot; Alternatively, &quot;I used to do that/like that when I was a baby, but I'm not a baby anymore.&quot; When I say, &quot;that's right, you're a little boy now,&quot; he always corrects me: He's a BIG boy.</li>
<li>Totally into Dora and Diego. V&aacute;manos! He surprised me the other day by counting to 10 in Spanish, but I recovered quickly and taught him 11-20. We now count to 20 together in both English and Spanish. I'm sure my mother-in-law would love it if he'd learn some Korean&#8212;and honestly, I would too&#8212;but since I already know quite a bit of Spanish (more than I realized&#8212;Dora has jogged my memory, and all kinds of phrases and verb conjugations keep popping into my head), it's fun that the Beaner's learning some, too. Our only concern at this point is that he wants to watch Dora and Diego ALL THE TIME. Are we bad parents for letting him watch up to three episodes at a time? </li>
<li>Asks all the time, &quot;what's that say? What's that say?&quot; It reminds me of when he was learning the car models, and he'd say &quot;adjuwah?&quot; whenever he came across one he didn't know. Now he's pointing to practically every word he sees and asking what it says. At the moment he doesn't have the tools he needs for reading, but he's memorizing the shapes of words, how certain combinations of words appear on labels, and what story words go with which pictures in books, and reading them back to us. &quot;That says 'RICE'. That says 'CRACKERS'. That says 'PHILADELPHIA'.&quot; I used to find it kinda hard to read to him when he was littler, but now that he understands the stories and has begun to memorize them and ask questions about them, I find I want to read to him more often. It's nice.</li>
<li>Favorite foods: watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, blueberries, strawberries, mango... basically any kind of fruit. Carr's whole wheat crackers, Sesame Street crackers, blueberry bagels, chocolate chip pancakes (and chocolate in general&#8212;oy!), avocado maki, veggie corn dogs, vanilla rice milk, miso soup, fish... ok, I guess the list of what he doesn't like would be a lot shorter. Actually, I can't think of much he doesn't like, except for really spicy and really sour foods. We're still on a no-milk-and-no-ice-cream diet because of the hives, but he seems to tolerate cheese without any trouble. Pizza and quesadillas are fine by him.</li>
<li>He's pretending up a storm. Really, it's gone to a whole new level now. I catch him making up whole pretend scenarios, complete with two- or three-way dialog, when he's in the bathtub or just playing quietly by himself. He'll also rope us into his pretending, too. Sometimes he'll create an adventure based on something he saw on Dora (&quot;check my backpack and see if there's anything in there we can use!&quot;)&#8212;which threw my Mom for a loop when she was here because she hadn't seen Dora yet&#8212;and other times he'll come up with something on his own. Aura told me that today at the park he parked himself behind one of the cut-outs on the climbing structure and said, &quot;I have a store. What do you want?&quot; She asked for ice cream, and he said he was out. &quot;But I can make some in my kitchen, which is over there!&quot; he said, pointing to the toddler climbing structure. They raced over there, and he made pretend strawberry ice cream.</li>
<li>He's extremely nosy. He wants to know everything we mutter to each other (&quot;what'd you say?&quot;), what the people in the next booth are eating, whether that man who just got up from the table went home or just to the bathroom, who that woman is, what she's doing, what he's doing, what they're saying, and where they're going. Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? He sounds like a pushy tabloid reporter most of the time. (It occurs to me now that if I put a toy camera in his hands, as I've been thinking about doing, he may join the paparazzi.) He also likes to repeat what we say to each other, as if I didn't hear Al or he didn't hear me. &quot;Honey, what do you want for dinner?&quot; / &quot;I was thinking pizza.&quot; / &quot;He say, 'I was thinking pizza.'&quot; Yeah, thanks Beaner, I heard. Because he was talking<em> to me</em>.</li>
<li>He's singing  a lot&#8212;and even starting to sing in tune. Even *Al* is starting to sing in tune, I think thanks to the many family sing-a-longs initiated by the Beaner. He's just completed what I think will be his last Music Class, but we now have several Music Class CDs in rotation, plus the Cars soundtrack (though he pretty much only wants to listen to Real Gone by Sheryl Crow&#8212;&quot;The Race Song&quot; because it plays during the opening race in the movie&#8212;and Life is a Highway by Rascal Flatts). We've got lots of material to keep him on his singing kick, I think. </li>
<li>Oh, speaking of music, we took him to the Experience Music Project when we were in Seattle, and he LOVED playing with all the instruments&#8212;especially the drums. We waited for a booth with a full drumset, a bass, and a guitar in it, and we ended up having an impromptu&#8212;and REALLY FUN&#8212;family jam. He was such a natural with the sticks that Al's started looking for a scaled-down drumset for him, and Al's also gotten out his accoustic guitar and replaced all the broken strings. (I can hear him strumming on it downstairs now.) Coincidentally, I'd been itching to play my bass before we went to Seattle; the only thing that's stopping me is that it's currently buried under a mound of stuff in the guest bedroom closet. I'm going to have Al help me dig it out this weekend, and we'll continue the search for the kid drumset then, too. Hopefully there are some more family jams in our future.</li>
<li>After a couple months of taking showers, we're back to bathtime. The Beaner now cries when we pull the plug and try to take him out. We pretty much leave him in there to play with the cups and boats, and just poke our heads in now and then to make sure he's playing and swimming and not drowning.</li>
<li id="windmill">I'm still snuggling him to sleep. He'll *sometimes* consent to let Al do it if I'm not here (and I'll be going to Germany for a little over a week at the end of June, so hopefully he'll accept Daddy as a substitute fairly quickly, or it will be a rough 9 nights), and he'll readily vote for Grandma to do it if she's available, but the nighttime snuggle routine is seemingly entrenched. I waffle about whether we should try to break him of it; mostly I don't see any harm in it, and I value the time as much as he does (most of the time). Sometimes I don't have the patience for it or just really need to work, and those nights, while rare, can be torture. One night I was in total windmill mode (as in &quot;if you don't step away, I'M GOING TO <em>WINDMILL</em>!&quot;), and I just laid there with tears rolling down my face as he rubbed his hot, sticky arms against my neck. I finally said, &quot;Beaner, Mommy *really* needs you to go to sleep as fast as you possibly can,&quot; and I held his hand to keep it away from my throat. He was asleep in five minutes, and I fervently (but silently) thanked him for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Ugh, there are about a million other things that I'm not thinking of right now, but it's late, and I vowed that tonight I would go to bed EARLY. (It's 11:35pm, which I guess still qualifies as early because it's before midnight. &lt;sigh&gt;) Instead of trying to come up with more bullet points, I'll just include another video, which I think demonstrates his personality better than anything half-coherent I could write right now.

<h3 class="title">More Swimming</h3>

<p>
Until we find swimming lessons (thanks, Marisa, for the tip about the Christian Street Y!) or a regular pool to visit (does anyone have information regarding rumors I've heard that some Center City hotels offer pool memberships to locals?), there's always the plastic baby pool that we picked up at Babies 'R Us for like five bucks. It was a total impulse buy; we sort of just shrugged and figured if the Beaner used it once, we'd have gotten our money's worth.
</p>


<p>
He's now used it not once but TWICE, and I suspect there are many more uses in our future. Hot Philly summers + a kid who loves to swim + a back deck just large enough for a baby pool = much fun for the kiddo. It's sort of the urban equivalent of suburbia's running through the sprinkler (something I grew up doing). And with the little cafe table and umbrella out there now, it's even fun for us. On Saturday I set up the pool, sunscreened up the Beaner, opened the umbrella, and brought my laptop out. I got a bit of writing done while he splashed around, and we both enjoyed the warm breezes and foot-cooling water.

In re-watching this now, I realize that he was asking me how to swim&#8212;as in "how is swimming accomplished, mother?"&#8212;rather than asking what I thought of how he was swimming. Duh.
</p>

<p>
And because I assume that if *I* cannot resist video of my child trying to soak the car (which was parked below the deck due to a garage door problem, now solved), you will not be able to resist such a video either, I present a second clip of the splashing. Come on, you know you want to watch it.

<h3 class="title">Sprout</h3>

<p>
I took several <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=%22the+beaner%22+AND+pettingfarm&d=taken-20070608-20070610&ct=5">photos of the Beaner</a> yesterday, and I didn't end up posting a couple of them because although they were cute, they weren't particularly flattering. He looked kind of... <em>chubby</em>. Is this awful of me?
</p>

<p>
[Insert transition here, I'm too lazy to think of a good one.] This morning woke up to a very sticky Beaner in bed with me (he jumped in when he woke up this morning). Since we'd been BBQing with Al's cousins down in Columbia, Maryland until about the Beaner's bedtime, Al had just given him a baby wipe bath and dressed him in his jammies for the ride home. (He fell asleep on schedule 10 minutes into the 2-hour drive home.) The baby wipe had apparently gotten off the superficial dirt, but it left the sweaty, icky, sunscreen-y deep dirt intact.
</p>

<p>
When I'd finally had enough of trying to sleep next to the sticky, I popped him into the shower to scrub it off him. When I got him out, I noticed he looked... talller. Not chubby at all (I could see his ribcage), and definitely taller. Is it possible that he grew overnight?
</p>

<p>
We've mostly been measuring him down in the kitchen with his shoes on, and he's been holding steady at 37". This time I had him back up to the bedroom door barefoot and drew a pencil mark at the top of his head, above the latch. When I measured from the floor to the mark, I got a reading of 37.75". I don't know if all that growing was done overnight, but he's almost two inches taller than he measured at his last well-baby visit (a measurement also taken without shoes). It seems the old pattern of him fattening up right before a growth spurt continues to hold.
</p>

<h3 class="title">My Every Day...At Night</h3>

<p>
I've been totally unsuccessful at blogging daily this year, as I endeavored to do after a positive experience with <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/11/">NaBloPoMo</a>, and it's why I've been hesitant to join any of the "photo-a-day" groups that are so popular on Flickr. 
</p>

<p>
Even after spending weeks being inspired by <a href="http://www.freshperspective.com/">Lori</a>'s <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/lorilea/sets/72157594364226820/">My Every Day</a> set, I resisted the urge to try something that required a daily commitment. About two weeks ago, however, I finally caved. I became so entranced by the little windows into Lori's daily existence that I decided I couldn't *not* <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157600238740199/">try it myself</a>. I know Lori started her set mainly as a creative exercise, much the way writers force themselves to write *something* every day&#8212;and I can really see how it *has* helped her photographic eye&#8212;but what I get out of it is that little window into someone else's life. (With the lens vignetting on some of her recent photos, I feel like I'm literally looking through a window, too. :)
</p>

<p>
I started my My Every Day set not with the goal to become a better photographer, but to provide that little window into *my* life. So far, I think I'm accomplishing that goal&#8212;I've kept up with the daily-ness of the exercise, and I can see patterns emerging when I look at the thumbnails. What I didn't count on, however, was that it would make me want to experiment more as a photographer (or, at least, make me want to pull out the tools I used to experiment with years ago but haven't had the time or inclination to fiddle with recently). In other words, I think I started at the other end of the stick from Lori, but we're both ending up in the middle.
</p>

<p>
Last night at around 8pm I realized I hadn't taken my daily photo yet, and I resolved to take the tripod outside after I put the Beaner to bed. Never mind that I was already in my pajamas; I'd just throw on some yoga pants, my Dreamweaver hoodie, and a pair of clogs, and I'd be good to go.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I ended up staying out for about an hour, roaming around my neighborhood looking for interesting subjects on which to test long exposure times. The results may not be spectacular, exactly, but they represent a stretch for me, which is good.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Today on the way back from dropping off the Beaner at sharecare, I found myself fantasizing about film. Maybe I'll buy that <a href="http://www.holgamods.com/35mm/">35mm-modified Holga</a> (I have no patience for film bags). Maybe I'll try some experiments with my old friend the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/minoltax700/">Minolta x700</a> and the expired 400CN and Portra VC film I've got lying around, and worry about how to share the results later. I know I'll definitely be going out with the tripod again, that's for sure.

<h3 class="title">Behind on the Bath</h3>

<p>
I am so far behind in chronicling our master bath remodel that I've completely given up hope of catching up. Part of the problem is that I hate spamming my Flickr photo stream with bathroom photos, and I'm too lazy to just embed them directly into my posts. Nothing much has been happening lately anyway; we had cause to call our contractor from Seattle before Memorial Day Weekend (there was a problem with the alarm), and he said that they wouldn't be back in the house until the following Wednesday.
</p>

<p>
We arrived home on Tuesday night, and we waited the rest of that week and all of last week for signs that anything was going to happen. Nada. It was on my list of things to do today to e-mail the contractor and gently ask if he'd ever be coming back, but I didn't get to it before Steve showed up to drop off "a sink and some granite," as he put it. I was thinking, jeez, is he going to be able to get the slabs for the sink up the stairs by himself?, and I asked him if anyone would be coming tomorrow. He didn't know.
</p>

<p>
At around 5:00 I went down to make something to eat, and I stopped in the master bedroom to see what Steve had dropped off. It was indeed a sink (in the box), what I assume are the fixtures, and some granite edging. Where the heck was the countertop? That's when I noticed, out of the corner of my eye, that the shadows in the actual bathroom looked different. I turned on the temporary light and saw this:
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/541761900/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1286/541761900_61cf4de0c4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="DSCF5119" /></a><br />
Here you can clearly see just how behind I am in blogging the remodeling progress: Although I took pictures of the day the cabinetry arrived and also of the day it was installed, I never wrote about it. I don't even think I posted photos or wrote about the painting, though maybe that's where I left off...
</p>

<p>
I have no idea when the guys came in to do this. Was I out running an errand for an extra-long time over the past week and a half? Did they come while I was taking the Beaner to sharecare one morning? I have no idea. It doesn't look like the countertop is set yet (I think the sink has to go in first because it's an undermount), but the mere fact of its arrival is something to rejoice over (and wonder about). Progress continues!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Job Myths</h3>

<p>
Al forwarded me this one from Boston.com: <a href="http://www.boston.com/jobs/news/articles/2007/06/10/6_myths_about_work/">6 myths about work</a>. I can personally vouch for at least two items on the list: 
</p>

<p>
<strong>#2. Getting a promotion is good for you</strong>, under which it is explained that
</p>

<blockquote>
Most people who are good at their nonmanagement jobs won't excel as leaders. It takes a very specific personality type to be better as a leader than as the worker who's actually doing the work.
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>#6. Work hard and good things will come</strong>, whereas the truth is that
</p>

<blockquote>
You'll actually be rewarded only if you're likable. People get hired for their qualifications, but they get promoted because people like working with them. So spend your days trying to figure out what people need and what people want, and how you can help them. Empathy makes you likable.
</blockquote>

<h3 class="title">Outlook</h3>

<p>
So I'm starting to freak out about my business trip to Hamburg... mainly because I leave next Wednesday, I have a bunch of laundry and packing to do (plus some house-cleaning and preparation for my parents' visit while I'm away), and our entire weekend, from Friday night to Sunday night, is full. (Also, I haven't done any Father's Day shopping. I totally suck.)
</p>

<p>
I'm ahead of the game in one respect, though: I finally looked on a map to verify that Hamburg is where I thought it might be&#8212;namely, in the northern part of Germany, close to Denmark. I also started trying to memorize the subway stops I'll need to know, though that's kind of a lost cause at this point. Too many German street and place names jammed into my head at the moment make for Uptbahnhofkerflufflestrasse soup.
</p>

<p>
It also occurred to me (days ago, actually, but I haven't gotten around to it until just this minute) to check the weather forecast, so I'd know what to pack. Heather mentioned that there was a heat wave going on in Berlin, but I wasn't sure if Hamburg, being both farther north and on the sea, would be as hot. The answer is no, it seems. It's just like here at the moment, only a heck of a lot rainier.

<h3 class="title">Randomness, part 31</h3>

<p>
Just so's you know: I haven't abandoned my My Every Day photo project. I *did* take photos on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and I hope to upload them... soon. The problem is currently that I've used all the hard disk space on my MacBook, and we're wrastlin' with an NAS drive that doesn't seem to like our wacky home network. I'll probably end up having to buy a separate external drive just for the MacBook tomorrow, at which point I'll be able to download (and thus, upload) photos again. I hope.
</p>

<p>
We had a lovely weekend with my parents, Al had a Father's Day trifecta (an awesome round of golf in perfect weather with me as company&#8212;but not as seething source of frustration, since my ankle only permitted me to putt&#8212;plus a yummy dinner of Maryland crabs, plus a generous brunch by the water at the Sheraton Columbia), and the Beaner had a particularly fabulous time swimming in a blow-up pool, throwing balls into trees with my mom, and pitching golf balls with my dad. He is going to LOVE staying with them when we go away for Al's birthday next month; I doubt he'll even notice we're gone.

News flash for lovers of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/506056219/">the $8.99 v-neck stretch T from Target</a>: I stopped in at the Target store near my parents' house to buy a few more today, figuring I could use another white, another navy or black, and another purplish-heather (see link). It turns out they've turned over their color inventory, so I was able to get three *different* colors today: a pinker version of the purplish-heather (it's rather like my hair color, actually), a lemon/lime color that's much less neon (and slightly more green) than the version that made me look like a walking virus when I made my original purchases, and a darker heather brown than the tan heather I got on my second trip. On Al's advice, I declined to buy the bluish-green number; while it wasn't as bad as the original neon green-yellow, it didn't really do anything for me. I'm assuming these color changes are intentional and not just weirdnesses with the dye lots; either way, BONUS!
</p>

<p>
I am still wigging out about not being prepared for my trip to Germany. I did laundry, fixed a big bug that was hanging over my head, and made the Beaner's bed (oh, that's another story&#8212;remind me to tell you about the Pull-Up status eventually) tonight, but it occurred to me over the weekend that I probably don't have the right outlet adaptors, that I need to figure out the whole currency thing, and that I don't have enough 1oz. bottles in which to put liquids, gels, and creams to make carrying on a possibility. There may be a frantic trip to the store tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
Oh! One other point in my favor: I made it out to the store on Friday morning and got Al the Father's Day gift he wanted: the special iPod accessory kid that he'd only ever seen at Costco. It has a bunch of A/V stuff, an adaptor that lets you listen to FM radio on your iPod, and an external charger. He was happy, so the trip and the extra Friday frenzy was worth it.
</p>

<p>
OK, now: Must. Sleep.

<h3 class="title">Yeah, I Know What I'm Doing</h3>

<p>
Arrived in Hamburg yesterday and made it to the office without any trouble. The cab driver was astonished when I gave him a 40% tip, though, so maybe that's not done here. (I was feeling a bit generous because he'd made such a great effort to chat with me after stating up front that his English was nicht gut.) I dropped my tip to 30% for the ride from the office to the hotel at the end of the day, but when the driver practically jumped out and kissed my hand, I decided that perhaps 30% was also on the high side.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately the internet connection in the hotel was down, and I wasn't able to connect via wireless from the lounge, so my plan to send a number of e-mails, upload photos, video chat with Al and the Beaner, and, most importantly, get information about how to navigate the subway here were totally shot.
</p>

<p>
I now realize what a sissy I've been, traveling mostly to countries where English is the native language. Knowing a little bit of German from college doesn't help much when you're trying to figure out (a) where the subway is, (b) where to buy a ticket for it, and (c) what kind of ticket you need. Even once I found the button on the ticket machine that switched from German to English, I was lost; the instructions converted to English, but the ticket names did not, and subtle differences between them were not explained. I knew that one was a 6-hour ticket for 1 adult and up to three children, one was a 9-hour ticket, another was a 3-day ticket, and so on. I basically just pressed random buttons to see how much I would be charged for each option and figured that anything over a couple Euros couldn't be right.
</p>

<p>
I finally settled on a short-haul ticket that cost &#8364;1,30 and made my way down to the subway platform for the second time. (The first time I went down I assumed there would be a way to buy a ticket on the platform, but a policeman who knew a little English pointed me back up the stairs.) I thought I did a rather good job of figuring out which side of the platform to stand on, but I won't give myself too much credit for getting on the right train since all the trains that stop at Haupbahnhof go to LandungsbrÃ¼cken (my stop).
</p>

<p>
I was two or three deep waiting to board, but finding a seat wasn't difficult. At the next two stops several people crowded the doors to get off, but at LandungsbrÃ¼cken I was the only one getting off. I got out of my seat before the actual stop and stood by the door. When we pulled into the station, I waited for the door to open, but it didn't. I figured the train just needed to inch forward a bit. Next thing I knew I heard the "door closing" sound coming from another car and frantically looked around for a button to push. There was one on either side of the door, but I only had time to push one, so I opted for the one on the left.
</p>

<p>
A woman in a seat adjacent to the door noticed my distress and said something to me in German&#8212;I'm assuming something along the lines of "you have to push the button to open the door," but she was pointing away from the button I'd just pushed.... and the train started to pull away from the station. At least this gave me a second to notice, at groin level, the button that actually opened the doors, which was on the door itself.
</p>

<p>
By the time we arrived at the next station, I'd figured out the system. I pressed the button, the doors opened, and I crossed to the other side of the platform. This time there was only one person in front of me waiting to board the train back to LandungsbrÃ¼cken, and I saw him press a similar button on the outside of the door to open it. Good to know for next time.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, after a 15 minute walk in which I simply followed the Elbe so as not to get lost, I arrived at the office... around 10am. Not exactly bright and early, but hey, I made it!

<h3 class="title">Yeah, I Know What I'm Doing, Part II</h3>

<p>
I have figured out the subway. I am a pro at ordering a decaf cappucino in German. I can ask whether a sandwich has only cheese in it, and I know how to get only steamed milk out of the coffee machine at work. And I just took a second birth control pill rather than my thyroid medication. Yep, I'm a regular whiz kid here.

<h3 class="title">Tipsy</h3>

<p>
After an intense two-day wind and rainstorm, during which the Elbe <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/640751607/">overflowed its banks</a> around the Adobe office (a not-uncommon occurrance in spring and fall, but much rarer in summer), the sky still looks a bit <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/640751865/">threatening</a>, and it feels more like a fog-shrouded San Francisco evening than a European summer morning. I chose to walk from the subway yesterday just in case <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/640751715/">the bridge at the Altona ferry landing was flooded</a>, to the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/637259378/">peril of my umbrella</a> and the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/640466113/">complete soaking of my pants and shoes</a>. I would have been better off crossing a flooded bridge.

This morning the water level seemed lower, so I opted to wait for the ferry rather than walk. I guess the ride was bumpier than usual, because as soon as we took off from LandungsbrÃ¼cken the front windows of the ferry were obscured by heavy sprays of water. Another indication of a turbulent ride: I'm sitting at my desk, and I can't seem to shake the feeling that the building is rocking back and forth. Reminds me of the days after our Last Hurrah Cruise, when I couldn't keep my balance on the sidewalk.

I swear, it's not the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/646463544/">beer</a>.
