<h3 class="title">More Swimming</h3>

<p>
Until we find swimming lessons (thanks, Marisa, for the tip about the Christian Street Y!) or a regular pool to visit (does anyone have information regarding rumors I've heard that some Center City hotels offer pool memberships to locals?), there's always the plastic baby pool that we picked up at Babies 'R Us for like five bucks. It was a total impulse buy; we sort of just shrugged and figured if the Beaner used it once, we'd have gotten our money's worth.
</p>

<p>
He's now used it not once but TWICE, and I suspect there are many more uses in our future. Hot Philly summers + a kid who loves to swim + a back deck just large enough for a baby pool = much fun for the kiddo. It's sort of the urban equivalent of suburbia's running through the sprinkler (something I grew up doing). And with the little cafe table and umbrella out there now, it's even fun for us. On Saturday I set up the pool, sunscreened up the Beaner, opened the umbrella, and brought my laptop out. I got a bit of writing done while he splashed around, and we both enjoyed the warm breezes and foot-cooling water.

In re-watching this now, I realize that he was asking me how to swim&#8212;as in "how is swimming accomplished, mother?"&#8212;rather than asking what I thought of how he was swimming. Duh.
</p>

<p>
And because I assume that if *I* cannot resist video of my child trying to soak the car (which was parked below the deck due to a garage door problem, now solved), you will not be able to resist such a video either, I present a second clip of the splashing. Come on, you know you want to watch it.

<p>I can't remember what it's called now, but the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue at 21st has (or had?) a swim club that was pretty reasonably priced. </p>

<p>If you don't mind the drive there's a girl scout camp out my way that offers afternoon and weekend memberships that are also pretty inexpensive. Or day passes all year long at the indoor Plymouth Meeting community center that offers swim classes and has an indoor water slide. </p>
