<h3 class="title">Behind on the Bath</h3>

<p>
I am so far behind in chronicling our master bath remodel that I've completely given up hope of catching up. Part of the problem is that I hate spamming my Flickr photo stream with bathroom photos, and I'm too lazy to just embed them directly into my posts. Nothing much has been happening lately anyway; we had cause to call our contractor from Seattle before Memorial Day Weekend (there was a problem with the alarm), and he said that they wouldn't be back in the house until the following Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
We arrived home on Tuesday night, and we waited the rest of that week and all of last week for signs that anything was going to happen. Nada. It was on my list of things to do today to e-mail the contractor and gently ask if he'd ever be coming back, but I didn't get to it before Steve showed up to drop off "a sink and some granite," as he put it. I was thinking, jeez, is he going to be able to get the slabs for the sink up the stairs by himself?, and I asked him if anyone would be coming tomorrow. He didn't know.
</p>

<p>
At around 5:00 I went down to make something to eat, and I stopped in the master bedroom to see what Steve had dropped off. It was indeed a sink (in the box), what I assume are the fixtures, and some granite edging. Where the heck was the countertop? That's when I noticed, out of the corner of my eye, that the shadows in the actual bathroom looked different. I turned on the temporary light and saw this:

Here you can clearly see just how behind I am in blogging the remodeling progress: Although I took pictures of the day the cabinetry arrived and also of the day it was installed, I never wrote about it. I don't even think I posted photos or wrote about the painting, though maybe that's where I left off...
</p>

<p>
I have no idea when the guys came in to do this. Was I out running an errand for an extra-long time over the past week and a half? Did they come while I was taking the Beaner to sharecare one morning? I have no idea. It doesn't look like the countertop is set yet (I think the sink has to go in first because it's an undermount), but the mere fact of its arrival is something to rejoice over (and wonder about). Progress continues!
