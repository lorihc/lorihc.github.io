<h3 class="title">Outlook</h3>

<p>
So I'm starting to freak out about my business trip to Hamburg... mainly because I leave next Wednesday, I have a bunch of laundry and packing to do (plus some house-cleaning and preparation for my parents' visit while I'm away), and our entire weekend, from Friday night to Sunday night, is full. (Also, I haven't done any Father's Day shopping. I totally suck.)
</p>
<p>
I'm ahead of the game in one respect, though: I finally looked on a map to verify that Hamburg is where I thought it might be&#8212;namely, in the northern part of Germany, close to Denmark. I also started trying to memorize the subway stops I'll need to know, though that's kind of a lost cause at this point. Too many German street and place names jammed into my head at the moment make for Uptbahnhofkerflufflestrasse soup.
</p>

<p>
It also occurred to me (days ago, actually, but I haven't gotten around to it until just this minute) to check the weather forecast, so I'd know what to pack. Heather mentioned that there was a heat wave going on in Berlin, but I wasn't sure if Hamburg, being both farther north and on the sea, would be as hot. The answer is no, it seems. It's just like here at the moment, only a heck of a lot rainier.
