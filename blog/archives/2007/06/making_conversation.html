"Is it the end of the day?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, buddy. It's the end of the day.
</p>

<p>
[To Aura] "You can go home now."
</p>

<p>
[Aura seems a bit offended by this dismissal; I explain that it's not an order, but his way of letting her know it's OK if she leaves. I'm not sure this explanation was satisfactory to her.] EXIT AURA.
</p>

<p>
"How is Aura gon' get home? It's too far to walk."
</p>

<p>
"I think she'll probably take the bus, honey."
</p>

<p>
"Daddy takes the bus to work."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he does take the bus to work sometimes. And sometimes he walks. How does mommy get to work?"
</p>

<p>
"She goes up the stairs and works on her computer!"
</p>

<p>
"That's right! I do go up the stairs and work on my computer."
</p>

<p>
"How you paint that?"
</p>

<p>
"Paint what?" [I look around.] "How did I paint what?"
</p>

<p>
"Paint your hair! You painted your hair, and now it looks really nice!"
</p>

<p>
[I remember that the Beaner had watched me apply Manic Panic to my hair that morning with a brush.] "Oh! Thanks, buddy."
</p>

<p>
"You're welcome."
