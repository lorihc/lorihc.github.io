The Beaner drew this in his handy-dandy notebook (a small, square notepad he picked out at Staples, rather than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlues-Clues-Party-Notebook-Crayons%2Fdp%2FB00009VDBM%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dtoys-and-games%26qid%3D1185827213%26sr%3D8-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">an official Blues Clues branded one</a>) last night:

I asked him if I could tear it out and hang it on my bulletin board, and he agreed. We aren't quite drawn to scale, and we're obviously missing bodies, but as far as I know it's the first rendering of us he's done where we're recognizable as people. Such a big deal to me, I can't tell you.

<p>Sorry for laughing at "missing bodies." But I agree - it is a wonderful milestone.</p>

<p>ARE you missing bodies? He's clearly drawn "something" below your heads. Maybe he just sees blobs as people's bodies?? :-)</p>

<p>One of the links I found when I Googled "child development drawings of people" indicated that very young children usually draw people without bodies (and with arms or feet sticking out of their heads) because that's what they see when they look down. They perceive themselves as a head and feet (and, if they hold their arms out to the side, arms). </p>

<p>I think this is probably why the Beaner drew our heads fairly elongated -- he sees heads and bodies as a single blob with feet at the bottom. Fascinating stuff, really; I can't wait for him to be inspired to draw people again! (I don't want to influence the outcome by suggesing that he do it.)</p>
