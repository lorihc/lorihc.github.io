<h3 class="title">Creepy</h3>

<p>
OK, I just discovered, when trying to look for an old blog post on my site, that my category archives had been hacked. As in changed&#8212;by someone other than me, obviously&#8212;to include a spam link. I'm in the process of fixing them now, but oy, CREEPY.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update: </strong>free cooking recipes dot net can kiss my fucking ass. Just found more files linked to templates that were messed with&#8212;all on May 6, 2007 @ 1:14pm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update II: </strong>I think I've removed all of the spam links now. If you see references to "free recipes" floating around where they shouldn't be, please let me know.

<p>Exactly. It seems that the code was introduced via Movable Type, because it appeared in templates that weren't linked to files, too. I suspect a some kind of malicious code posted as a comment or something, but I don't know for sure...</p>

<p>Frank's site was hacked. They hit a directory I had forgotten about and were using it to send SPAM. It made me feel dirty and violated. Sorry this happened to you.</p>
