<h3 class="title">I Need a Hug</h3>

<p>
This, from Mimi Smartypants, was wonderful:
</p>
<blockquote>
Yesterday Nora and LT were playing catch, and in the process of trying to throw the ball precisely into her tiny mitt and thus increase her slim chances of success, he accidentally beaned her right in the nose. Blood gushed. Nora stood there dumbfounded for a split second, then threw down her mitt and ran straight for LT, wailing. I really wish the next baseball player to get hit with a ball would charge the mound in a similar fashion, crying and holding his arms up for a hug. The fistfights are so predictable.
</blockquote>

<p>
I did this once after getting in a minor car accident. I was so shook up when the other car slammed into mine that the first thing I did when I got out of the car was go over and hug the guy who hit me. He and his girlfriend (who was in the passenger seat) were mighty confused, I can tell you.

<p>Absolutely brilliant.</p>

<p>I didn't do the exact thing, but did quietly inquire about the safety of the guy who was screaming obscenities at me. "Sir, that must have been frightening. Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>A hug just when you need it is one of the best things in the world.</p>

<p>A guy turned right in front of me to go onto his driveway and after he hit me he was yelling at me "why didn't you go through that fence instead of letting me hit you, you bi*ch!" Ummm it was his fence so he would have been yelling at me for that.</p>

<p>It was lovely when I got home and had three grandchildren hugs to make me feel better.</p>
