<h3 class="title">Happy Birthday, Al!</h3>

<p>
My fabulous, patient, handsome, understanding, sweet, hilarious, hockey-playing, golf-crazy husband turns 40 today. To celebrate, we are going away for a golf weekend together (my parents will watch the Beaner in our absence, so it's a vacation for him, too). Because most of the birthday focus is on this weekend, I'm afraid that his actual birthday&#8212;TODAY&#8212;will be a bit anticlimactic. To help keep that from happening, I'm shouting out to the friends who know him well enough to have his cell phone number to send him a happy birthday text message. If you don't have his cell number, you can still wish him a happy birthday: just click on the photo below, and leave a comment in his Flickr stream.

<p>Why am I just realizing that Al's birthday is the day before mine? Had we discussed this before? My brain is mush...</p>
