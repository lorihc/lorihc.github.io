<h3 class="title">My Little Independent Man</h3>

<p>
This photo makes me so happy:
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/952446345/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1274/952446345_5e746a62bc.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="riding the escalator by himself at nordstrom (3)" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I can't explain why, exactly. It's partly his beautiful, shining face looking up at mine, it's partly his obvious pride that he's DOING SOMETHING HIMSELF, and it's partly something intangible... maybe a sense that oh my god, I created this amazing being (with Al's help, of course).
</p>

<p>
There are times when I forget how old the Beaner is, and when people ask I have to pause for a second to figure it out (sort of how I have to pause when people ask *my* age&#8212;on the one hand, I think 39 because I've had it in my head for a while now that I'm turning 39 this year, but on the other hand I think 36, because that's how old I feel. I never seem to come up with 38, my actual age). I keep thinking, for some reason, that he's 3-going-on-4, when he's really 2 years 8 months (today, in fact). I have actually answered "he's 4. No, wait! Sorry, he's two and a half" before. Maybe it's because most of his clothes are size 4T? And because I'm a total bat?
</p>

<p>
Things that remind me he's only 2 years 8 months:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He still wants me to snuggle him to sleep at night (and as often as possible during the day, too).</li>
<li>He now sometimes bursts into tears&#8212;which used to be reserved for I'M INJURED&#8212;when he doesn't get what he wants.</li>
<li>He can't tie his own shoes, and he still has trouble with buttons.</li>
<li>He hasn't mastered spitting after brushing his teeth, despite months of demonstration and practice.</li>
<li>His insistence that he can't do things, and that I must do them for him. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Things that make me forget he's only 2 years, 8 months:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The 4T clothes, as mentioned.</li>
<li>His manners, which tend to melt everyone within earshot when he uses them (sometimes he forgets).</li>
<li>The rapid expansion of his imagination, and the complexity of his pretend scenarios and dialogues.</li>
<li>His singing of Howard Jones, OK Go, and Arlo Guthrie/Wilco songs (as well as the ones from his Music Class CDs)&#8212;in tune, and often with the correct lyrics.</li>
<li>His desire to tell me everything that happened to him each day. This will SO come in handy when he starts school; I plan to get the scoop on his school day on the walk home.</li>
<li>His desire to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/952335515/">run with the big kids</a>, and to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/952335487/">mimic them</a> so accurately.</li>
<li>His insistence that he can do things himself, and that he doesn't want my help.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see from the last bullet item in each list, he's definitely on the brink of something; it's like he's tottering between toddlerhood and childhood. Now that I think of it, I haven't described him as a toddler in a while; it seems almost as inappropriate a label as calling him a baby would have been after he turned two.

<p>Thanks, guys! </p>

<p>Kari: He always asks for a little bag when we go to Nordstrom, and the women behind the jewelry counters are always more than happy to give him one (it's good advertising ;). Last time, the woman asked if he wanted a box to go in it, but he declined. This time he said to me, "now I need some groceries to put in my bag!" I gave him his Dunkin Donuts bag, since I had no groceries on me, and Nordstrom doesn't sell them. :)<br />
