<p>
Conversation tonight with the Beaner, as I was putting lotion on him:
</p>
<p>
Beaner: Look, TWO lotions!
</p>

<p>
Me: [Seeing only one] Where's the other one?
</p>
<p>
Beaner: Downstairs, in the bathroom! [He's right, of course; there's an identical lotion in the downstairs bathroom.]
</p>
<p>
Me: Your eczema is getting much, much better. Do you remember where you got the eczema?
</p>
<p>
Beaner: Uhhhh...
</p>
<p>
Me: From the pool and the sun, in Colorado. [My kid tans like his father, but he has my sensitive skin&#8212;and the chlorine and intense sun totally wrecked him.] Remember the night in Colorado when you were staying with Hannah, and the eczema sort of exploded, and you got a bit of pee on it, and you criiiiiiiied because it stung? And Hannah called us because you were inconsolable, and we left the movie early to bring you cortisone and a caramel apple and cards to play with? That's why we're putting lotion on you now: to make that eczema go away (and it's working, slowly but surely!).
</p>
<p>
Beaner: I don't like the mousawikiwi.
</p>
<p>
Me: Huh?
</p>
<p>
Beaner: The mousakiwi. I don't like that.
</p>
<p>
Me: Did you say 'mousakiwi'? I'm sorry, I'm not understanding you.
</p>
<p>
Beaner: &lt;sigh&gt; You know, where the mouse runs and runs and runs, and they throw knives at him, and he's running [he makes a circular gesture with his finger to indicate 'running']... I didn't like that.
</p>
<p>
Me: Do you mean <em>Ratatouille</em>?
</p>
<p>
Beaner: Right, yes. <em>Ratatouille</em>. I didn't like it.
</p>
<p>
Me: Yes, you're right&#8212;you didn't like it, and we had to leave. And you're also right that it was the movie Mommy and Daddy were seeing the night you were with Hannah and you criiiiiied when the pee got on your eczema.
</p>

<p>
We still have high hopes of seeing the ending to Ratatouille someday (we got about 20 or 30 minutes further into it in Colorado than we did at the first attempt in New Jersey). Al's thinking that maybe we can go see Harry Potter this weekend (we're going away for his 40th birthday and leaving the Beaner with my parents, his first time away from both of us at once) and then sneak into Ratatouille to see the end. He figures we only need to see the last hour or so, maybe less, and we've already paid to see it twice. We'll see how that goes...

<p>I absolutely love the connections they make. He sees one lotion, but knows there are really two. And the way the memories work. So sweet.</p>

<p>So true. After last night's conversation, I knew not to look for the second white Saab 9-5 wagon when he said "two white Saabs!" on the way to sharecare this morning. Now that I know the connection's in his mind, it was easy to understand that the second one used to belong to Grandma (she's since traded it in for an Acura TL, which is a bit difficult for the Beaner to wrap his brain around; I suspect he'll still ask about the Saab even after he's had a ride in the Acura this weekend :).</p>
