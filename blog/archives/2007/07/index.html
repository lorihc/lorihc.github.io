<h3 class="title">I'm Back (and Kind of All Over the Place)</h3>

<p>
After a long layover in a smoky, under-construction terminal at Frankfurt airport and a 90-minute flight delay, I finally made it back to Philadelphia on Friday evening. I arrived home to a startled Beaner, who gasped, "Mommy!" when he saw me, but then froze on the spot. I scooped him up and snuggled him, so he'd realize it was really me. 
</p>

<p>
He was trembling, either with disbelief or excitement (or possibly shock). "Look!" he said to Aura, "I said I wanted to snuggle Mommy, <em>and here she is.</em> I said I wanted to talk to Mommy, <em>and here she is</em>," as if he'd conjured me out of thin air with the power of his wishes alone.
</p>

<p style="border-top: 1px dotted #666; margin: 0 30%;"></p>

<p>
I think I've finally posted all the photos of Hamburg that I want to post; a few I've saved just for Al and the Beaner because they're the only two people who would appreciate them. You can view the set as a slideshow here (click on the "i" icon that appears when you mouse over the current photo to see titles and descriptions as the slideshow plays):
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157600457953890/show/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1022/677672318_1c3b98313b.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="ernst-merck-strasse" /></a><br />
This is not Chicago.<br />
(The above would be an in-joke with the Beaner were he able to read it; for some reason, he keeps telling everyone that I was in Chicago last week, that I bought the sandals in the photo below at a shoe store in Chicago, and that I brought him gummi bears <em>from Chicago</em>. I wonder if this has anything to do with the fact that he only has a U.S. map in his bedroom; it occurred to me while chatting with one of my colleagues in Hamburg that I was <em>off the map</em>. Imagining me in Chicago may have been the Beaner's way of pulling me back from the edge of the world.)
</p>

<p style="border-top: 1px dotted #666; margin: 0 30%;"></p>

<p>
On Saturday we took the Beaner to see Ratatouille, but during the usual Pixar pre-feature short he announced it was "too scary," and then he repeated that mantra for the next 20 minutes, even from the safety of my lap. When it became clear that the movie was entirely over his head (though it was great fun for Al and me) and that the shouting chefs and flying kitchen knives were likely to be an enduring feature of the next 90 minutes or so, we finally agreed that it probably was too scary for him and made our exit. Al and I are now scheming over when we can get out to see the rest of the movie for ourselves.
</p>

<p style="border-top: 1px dotted #666; margin: 0 30%;"></p>

<p>
It's been interesting to observe how well Al and the Beaner survived&#8212;nay, thrived&#8212;in my absence. I'd even go so far as to say that the Beaner only *really* needs one parent, and that parent is Al, though I am of course useful in certain areas. I am the preferred bedtime snuggler and teeth-brusher, for one thing. I also have a knack for figuring out what the major transitions are, and when to make them. (For example, I had a sense that we'd left him in night-time Pull-Ups too long, mainly because we didn't want to be forced to do laundry if there was an accident. This suspicion was confirmed for me when, after weeks of waking up in the morning with a dry Pull-Up, the Beaner suddenly had a spate of accidents that left his Pull-Up, pajamas, and sheets completely soaked. It might sound counter-intuitive, but that's how I knew for absolutely sure that we had to move to underpants once and for all. He hasn't had a night-time accident since.) I'm also the one who pays the bills every month (and by that I mean that I arrange for payments to be made, either through online banking or by check; I do not mean to imply that I am the sole&#8212;or even the primary&#8212;breadwinner).
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/688653295/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1008/688653295_0d56bec9f3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="at the fountain 2" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Still, there is no doubt that the Beaner was *happy* to see me, and we've been having a great time playing since I got back. His imagination and pretending skills are getting quite sophisticated now, which makes spending long periods of time with him more fun. They're also useful for distracting him from something I don't want him to do or have; for example, rather than giving him the actual batteries he wants for the remote, I can say, "here, have a <em>pretend</em> battery!" and off we go into the Land of Make Believe. Wonderful.
</p>

<p style="border-top: 1px dotted #666; margin: 0 30%;"></p>

<p>
We've had an amazingly cool, sunny, and dry couple of days here in Philadelphia, where it's usually unbearably hot and humid this time of year. I opened my office window today to enjoy the fresh breeze, and after a couple hours it became apparent where the pile of leaves we discovered in the corner of our back deck yesterday came from: A pair of sparrows is building a nest in the bend of a downspout just above and to the right of my window, and they've been using the leaves to line the nest. They work very hard to pack them in, but inevitably, many fall out... and land on our deck.
</p>

<p>
The two sparrows have stopped to rest on my window ledge several times today, sometimes with a sprig of leaves clutched in their beaks (on the way up), sometimes just to fluff and shake (on the way down). Unfortunately by the time I've turned on the camera and reached for the shutter button, they've fluttered away, so I haven't gotten a photo of them. They haven't seemed to mind the sound of my voice, however, and have cocked their heads to listen when I've said hello and asked how their work was progressing. I hope to have another chance to capture their efforts with the camera tomorrow.
</p>

I swear, I put on two coats of Coppertone Sport SPF 50 before going outside. But two hours of this:

<p>
Sadly, the tops of my shoulders are much worse. Guess who'll be spending the day looking for a shrug or wrap to wear with her strapless dress to the formal wedding we're attending tonight?

<p>
I don't think I even had time to mention that we were back from Denver (and that I sort of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/751214095/">solved my strapless dress + sunburn problem</a>) before I took off again for Seattle. I arrived home again tonight hot, nauseous, and not wanting to go on another trip again for awhile. (Hopefully the two roadtrips we have planned for later this month won't be as tiring as all the timezone-crossing plane travel I've been doing lately. Also, only one of them involves leaving the Beaner behind&#8212;with my parents, with whom I know he'll have a blast&#8212;so there are unlikely to be heart-wrenching phone calls at random times of the night.)
</p>

<p style="border-top: 1px dotted #666; margin: 0 30%;"></p>

<p>
While I was in Denver I got news that my friend Jim of <a href="http://rittenhouse.blogspot.com/">The Rittenhouse Review</a> had died. I hadn't spoken to him as often after he moved out of our neighborhood, and he hadn't been updating his blogs regularly, so I was a bit out of touch&#8212;and the news came as a complete shock. I stood there with my mouth in a drooly "O", looking like someone had just punched me in the stomach, for several minutes after reading the e-mail from Susie M. I still can't quite believe it. Jim, I hope you're happy and healthy and whole again wherever you are now, and that someone's taking care of Mildred.

<p style="border-top: 1px dotted #666; margin: 0 30%;"></p>

<p>
As I just got back from Seattle tonight and need to catch up on some of the work I missed over the past three days of preparing two presentations on CSS-related topics, getting incredibly anxious over having to actually deliver those presentations, and then not quite knowing what to do with myself after I gave them (the post-performance anxiety is only slightly less severe than the pre-performance anxiety, but luckily my friend Jeanne stepped in with drinks and dinner at three of her favorite places near my hotel, and we had a fabulous, hedonistic evening of eating, drinking, and gabbing), I probably won't get a chance to upload the few photos I took while in Seattle until tomorrow at the earliest. I did, however, get a chance to upload my favorite photos from the wedding we attended in Steamboat Springs last weekend in the one day I had between trips. The set is here:

<h3 class="title">It's Both, Actually</h3>

<p>
During an IM conversation today I accidentally moused over an underlined word in the chat window (something I never do intentionally, for the record, but I leave this weird underlining feature in Trillian on because of the humorous results I sometimes get when an underlined word ends up under the mouse, as it did this time). When I saw this, I wondered if these were the only two entries for schedule, or if Trillian <em>knew something</em>.

You know, kind of like how I wonder if the spammers know something whenever I e-mail a friend I haven't talked to in a while, and then suddenly I get a boatload of spam from senders with suspiciously similar names to my friend's. Hmmmm.

<h3 class="title">Word Association</h3>

<p>
Conversation tonight with the Beaner, as I was putting lotion on him:
</p>

<p>
Beaner: Look, TWO lotions!
</p>

<p>
Me: [Seeing only one] Where's the other one?
</p>
<p>
Beaner: Downstairs, in the bathroom! [He's right, of course; there's an identical lotion in the downstairs bathroom.]
</p>
<p>
Me: Your eczema is getting much, much better. Do you remember where you got the eczema?
</p>
<p>
Beaner: Uhhhh...
</p>
<p>
Me: From the pool and the sun, in Colorado. [My kid tans like his father, but he has my sensitive skin&#8212;and the chlorine and intense sun totally wrecked him.] Remember the night in Colorado when you were staying with Hannah, and the eczema sort of exploded, and you got a bit of pee on it, and you criiiiiiiied because it stung? And Hannah called us because you were inconsolable, and we left the movie early to bring you cortisone and a caramel apple and cards to play with? That's why we're putting lotion on you now: to make that eczema go away (and it's working, slowly but surely!).
</p>
<p>
Beaner: I don't like the mousawikiwi.
</p>
<p>
Me: Huh?
</p>
<p>
Beaner: The mousakiwi. I don't like that.
</p>
<p>
Me: Did you say 'mousakiwi'? I'm sorry, I'm not understanding you.
</p>
<p>
Beaner: &lt;sigh&gt; You know, where the mouse runs and runs and runs, and they throw knives at him, and he's running [he makes a circular gesture with his finger to indicate 'running']... I didn't like that.
</p>
<p>
Me: Do you mean <em>Ratatouille</em>?
</p>
<p>
Beaner: Right, yes. <em>Ratatouille</em>. I didn't like it.
</p>
<p>
Me: Yes, you're right&#8212;you didn't like it, and we had to leave. And you're also right that it was the movie Mommy and Daddy were seeing the night you were with Hannah and you criiiiiied when the pee got on your eczema.
</p>

<p>
We still have high hopes of seeing the ending to Ratatouille someday (we got about 20 or 30 minutes further into it in Colorado than we did at the first attempt in New Jersey). Al's thinking that maybe we can go see Harry Potter this weekend (we're going away for his 40th birthday and leaving the Beaner with my parents, his first time away from both of us at once) and then sneak into Ratatouille to see the end. He figures we only need to see the last hour or so, maybe less, and we've already paid to see it twice. We'll see how that goes...

<h3 class="title">Creepy</h3>

<p>
OK, I just discovered, when trying to look for an old blog post on my site, that my category archives had been hacked. As in changed&#8212;by someone other than me, obviously&#8212;to include a spam link. I'm in the process of fixing them now, but oy, CREEPY.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update: </strong>free cooking recipes dot net can kiss my fucking ass. Just found more files linked to templates that were messed with&#8212;all on May 6, 2007 @ 1:14pm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update II: </strong>I think I've removed all of the spam links now. If you see references to "free recipes" floating around where they shouldn't be, please let me know.

<h3 class="title">Happy Birthday, Al!</h3>

<p>
My fabulous, patient, handsome, understanding, sweet, hilarious, hockey-playing, golf-crazy husband turns 40 today. To celebrate, we are going away for a golf weekend together (my parents will watch the Beaner in our absence, so it's a vacation for him, too). Because most of the birthday focus is on this weekend, I'm afraid that his actual birthday&#8212;TODAY&#8212;will be a bit anticlimactic. To help keep that from happening, I'm shouting out to the friends who know him well enough to have his cell phone number to send him a happy birthday text message. If you don't have his cell number, you can still wish him a happy birthday: just click on the photo below, and leave a comment in his Flickr stream.

<h3 class="title">Letting Go and Getting What You Want</h3>

<p>
A couple hours ago, I was frantic, on edge, in tears. Over code, and over all the things that were due tomorrow (and partly due to falling hard off the low-sugar wagon). It's amazing what letting go (and a little real food) can do for you. The to-do list is still there, some of the code mysteries remain unsolved, I'm still not fully packed for our trip tomorrow, and the Red Sox are losing.
</p>

<p>
I'm calm because once I decided there was no way I could do everything, I moved a few things to Monday and just decided I would live (and so would everyone else) if they were late. So Be It. &lt;inhale, exxxxxhale&gt; (As I type this, I can hear the Beaner's voice in my head saying, "just breathe, Mommy. Breathe.")
</p>

<p>
On a related note, <a href="http://www.superherodesigns.com/journal/archives/001098.html">Andrea</a> had a post the other day about asking for what you want. I'm a big proponent of this (so much so that I sometimes forget that others aren't as willing to ask for what they want, and they get frustrated waiting for me to figure it out while I go along figuring that if they wanted something different than they were getting, they'd say so). You don't always get what you want, but your <em>chances</em> of getting it go up dramatically when you ask.
</p>

<p>
Ever since I got back from Seattle the Beaner's been asking to sleep in my bed (which he didn't get) and waking up in the middle of the night to tearfully demand a snuggle from me (which he did get). Since I also happened to be staying up late working&#8212;and even later reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpecial-Topics-Calamity-Physics-Marisha%2Fdp%2F0143112120%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1184903624%26sr%3D8-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Special Topics in Calamity Physics</a>&#8212;this regimen of going in to snuggle him, or Al giving up his spot in our bed so the Beaner could snuggle me (if it was past 4:30am), was taking its toll on my sanity. (Actually, this may be more related to the first paragraph of this post than I realized.)
</p>

<p>
Last night I said to the Beaner, "OK, I need you to go to sleep now, so Mommy can go to sleep." Beaner: "You gotta sleep in here with me." Me: "No, boo. I'll happily snuggle you to sleep now, and I'll snuggle you again when you wake up in the morning, but in between I'm going to go to sleep in my own bed with Daddy. And I really need you to stay in your own bed and sleep until morning, OK?" Beaner: "You're going to snuggle me to sleep?" Me: "Yes." Beaner: "You snuggle me to sleep, and then Mommy can go to her own bed and sleep." Me: "Thanks, boo."
</p>

<p>
And ladies and gentlemen, he slept until 7:30am. It never hurts to ask for what you want.
</p>

<h3 class="title">I Need a Hug</h3>

<p>
This, from Mimi Smartypants, was wonderful:
</p>

<blockquote>
Yesterday Nora and LT were playing catch, and in the process of trying to throw the ball precisely into her tiny mitt and thus increase her slim chances of success, he accidentally beaned her right in the nose. Blood gushed. Nora stood there dumbfounded for a split second, then threw down her mitt and ran straight for LT, wailing. I really wish the next baseball player to get hit with a ball would charge the mound in a similar fashion, crying and holding his arms up for a hug. The fistfights are so predictable.
</blockquote>

<p>
I did this once after getting in a minor car accident. I was so shook up when the other car slammed into mine that the first thing I did when I got out of the car was go over and hug the guy who hit me. He and his girlfriend (who was in the passenger seat) were mighty confused, I can tell you.
</p>

<h3 class="title">FILO</h3>

<p>
Al just remarked how funny it was that our first baby gate is likely to be our last. He's right: Since he took the gate off the doorway to the Beaner's bedroom (we've been leaving it open for a couple months now at least) this morning, the gates around the staircase in the living room and entrance hall were dismantled months ago, and I remember putting the basement playroom gate out for freecycling when it was snowing, we're now down to the single gate at the top of the long, third-floor staircase. That gate is essentially the only door to my office, which is in the open space outside the Beaner's bedroom.
</p>

<p>
We bought this one remaining gate not for the Beaner, but for his cousin, who was two when he first visited us and stayed up here in the guest bedroom (where we're sleeping during the bathroom remodel, which is oh-so-close to being done, and yet drags on; more on that later). The Beaner hadn't even been born yet. It's mostly stayed open in the three years since Al installed it, but we started closing it as a precaution when we left the gate to the Beaner's bedroom open. We didn't want him to get up in the middle of the night and stumble down the stairs. (Fat chance of that happening; I think he's only ever opened the door to his room and let himself out two or three times at most, and those times were all in the light of morning.)
</p>

<p>
I also started closing it during the day after I injured my ankle and saved a bit of energy by moving around the upstairs in my office chair; I didn't want to miscalculate my trajectory and accidentally launch myself down the stairs. &lt;shudder&gt; 
</p>

<p>
I imagine that gate's got quite a future ahead of it still, as we move back down to the master bedroom, and the Beaner's still in danger of pitching down the stairs in the dark. And it is, as I mentioned, somewhat useful as an office door&#8212;at least in that it blocks the Beaner's and the nanny's access to me. Honestly, I don't want the former upstairs when I'm working or the latter up here at all.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it might seem like a mundate observation, that the first baby gate in will be the last out, but I wanted to record it here because it marks a connection to the early days of parenthood, and also because I haven't been blogging quite as much about parenthood in general or the Beaner in particular as I once did. It's that he's got a personality now/he deserves some privacy now thing, mostly... or maybe exactly.
</p>

<p>
When I try to think of what else it could be, it all ends up coming down to the fact that our parenting experience is starting to feel mostly unique to this kid, rather than being universal to all parents of newborns and infants, as it once did. I want to share some of that uniqueness, but I also want to treasure it, to save it for us and those closest to us.
</p>

<p>
I do wonder what it will be like when the Beaner starts school (in almost exactly 1 month), and I have new experiences of his that I'll want to chronicle. Will I do that here on the blog, or will I keep my musings private? I'm not sure yet. I *am* sure that I don't want to embarrass him (or at least, to the extent that I can prevent that; I am a MOM, after all, and therefore prone to embarrassing my kid at every turn, whether I intend to or not) or make getting along at school any more difficult than it otherwise would be. I also don't want to endanger him or his classmates in any way (and you never really know if you're doing that when you blog about your kids). I'm also sure that school will utterly shake up our lives *again*&#8212;I'm not sure I'm quite prepared to be ruled by the school calendar, school hours, and school rules just yet&#8212;and that I'll have *something* to say about that here.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, sorry to turn this post into a random ramble about parentblogging. I really did intend to just write a one-paragraph post about the gate, and I'm not exactly sure where it went off the rails. I don't feel like editing or deleting just now, though, so out it goes into the world. For those of you interested in the bathroom remodel, which I abandoned chronicling long, long ago, I'll try to post about that tomorrow.
</p>

<h3 class="title">My Little Independent Man</h3>

<p>
This photo makes me so happy:
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/952446345/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1274/952446345_5e746a62bc.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="riding the escalator by himself at nordstrom (3)" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I can't explain why, exactly. It's partly his beautiful, shining face looking up at mine, it's partly his obvious pride that he's DOING SOMETHING HIMSELF, and it's partly something intangible... maybe a sense that oh my god, I created this amazing being (with Al's help, of course).
</p>

<p>
There are times when I forget how old the Beaner is, and when people ask I have to pause for a second to figure it out (sort of how I have to pause when people ask *my* age&#8212;on the one hand, I think 39 because I've had it in my head for a while now that I'm turning 39 this year, but on the other hand I think 36, because that's how old I feel. I never seem to come up with 38, my actual age). I keep thinking, for some reason, that he's 3-going-on-4, when he's really 2 years 8 months (today, in fact). I have actually answered "he's 4. No, wait! Sorry, he's two and a half" before. Maybe it's because most of his clothes are size 4T? And because I'm a total bat?
</p>

<p>
Things that remind me he's only 2 years 8 months:
</p>

<ul>
<li>He still wants me to snuggle him to sleep at night (and as often as possible during the day, too).</li>
<li>He now sometimes bursts into tears&#8212;which used to be reserved for I'M INJURED&#8212;when he doesn't get what he wants.</li>
<li>He can't tie his own shoes, and he still has trouble with buttons.</li>
<li>He hasn't mastered spitting after brushing his teeth, despite months of demonstration and practice.</li>
<li>His insistence that he can't do things, and that I must do them for him. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Things that make me forget he's only 2 years, 8 months:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The 4T clothes, as mentioned.</li>
<li>His manners, which tend to melt everyone within earshot when he uses them (sometimes he forgets).</li>
<li>The rapid expansion of his imagination, and the complexity of his pretend scenarios and dialogues.</li>
<li>His singing of Howard Jones, OK Go, and Arlo Guthrie/Wilco songs (as well as the ones from his Music Class CDs)&#8212;in tune, and often with the correct lyrics.</li>
<li>His desire to tell me everything that happened to him each day. This will SO come in handy when he starts school; I plan to get the scoop on his school day on the walk home.</li>
<li>His desire to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/952335515/">run with the big kids</a>, and to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/952335487/">mimic them</a> so accurately.</li>
<li>His insistence that he can do things himself, and that he doesn't want my help.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see from the last bullet item in each list, he's definitely on the brink of something; it's like he's tottering between toddlerhood and childhood. Now that I think of it, I haven't described him as a toddler in a while; it seems almost as inappropriate a label as calling him a baby would have been after he turned two.

<p>
The Beaner drew this in his handy-dandy notebook (a small, square notepad he picked out at Staples, rather than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBlues-Clues-Party-Notebook-Crayons%2Fdp%2FB00009VDBM%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dtoys-and-games%26qid%3D1185827213%26sr%3D8-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">an official Blues Clues branded one</a>) last night:

</p>

<p>
I asked him if I could tear it out and hang it on my bulletin board, and he agreed. We aren't quite drawn to scale, and we're obviously missing bodies, but as far as I know it's the first rendering of us he's done where we're recognizable as people. Such a big deal to me, I can't tell you.
