<h3 class="title">The Man Has a Point</h3>

<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>These billboards are starting to freak me out. It's like Atlantic City is where all the bands we grew up with go to die.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Al: </strong>Yeah, all the twentysomethings are probably like, "George Thoroughgood? Who's <em>that</em>???"
</p>

<p>
<strong>Lori: </strong>I know! Look, there's one for Aerosmith and Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. I remember doing modern dance to "I Love Rock and Roll" in my 8th grade gym class. Who knew she was still around?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Al: </strong>I remember driving to the shore with my parents when I was a kid, and there'd be all these billboards for Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, and I'd be all, "who'd want to see <em>Tony Bennett</em>?" Now I get it: they were catering to the middle-aged folks looking to relive their youth...and now <em>we're</em> the middle-aged folks they're trying to lure.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Lori: </strong>Oh my god, you're right.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Al: </strong>I mean, tell me Pat Benatar isn't the Liza Minelli of our generation.
