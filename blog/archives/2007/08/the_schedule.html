<h3 class="title">The Schedule</h3>

<p>
I'm starting a new category with this post (for the moment I'm calling it "school", for lack of a better label, but I reserve the right to change it when I'm feeling more creative). The Beaner starts Montessori school tomorrow, and we've been practicing going to bed earlier and getting up earlier for a couple days now. For the most part it's worked well, but Al's been a bit confused&#8212;which makes sense, because the schedule I've been working off of is mostly in my head, and I can't expect him to <em>just know</em> where he's supposed to be and what he's supposed to do.
</p>
<p>
Something else that has been in my head is the idea that I would draw up a color-coded schedule showing where each of us needed to be, when, and doing what. I just hadn't gotten around to it by this morning, and so a bit more chaos than usual ensued when we both ended up trying to dress the Beaner at the same time, and neither of us was getting ready ourselves. (Of course, it didn't help that we all overslept by 20 minutes, and that the Beaner wet the bed&#8212;not a common occurrence, and the first time he's ever slept through it.) Good thing today was a dry run, and not an actual school day.
</p>

<p>
Thus is was a high priority on my to-do list today (along with a gazillion other WORK things I needed to do) to get at least a first draft of the schedule drawn up. It's particularly important WHERE each of us is during each 15-minute block because our master bath remodel still isn't finished. This means we're all still sharing the upstairs bathroom, and logjams at the sink or toilet could totally fuck up the plan.
</p>

</p>

<p>
This is just a first draft, of course, and thankfully there's a phase-in period at the school (which means the Beaner goes for just 30 minutes tomorrow and Thursday, 90 minutes Friday, and 90 minutes all next week before the real 3 hour, 45 minute, earlier-starting schedule begins the Monday after Labor Day). That'll give us a chance to work the kinks out.
</p>

<p>
Note also that the schedule only goes until 12pm; that's when Aura will arrive, and I'll go back to work. At first I was thinking that an earlier start to the day would mean a bit more work time for me in the morning, but I decided to use that time for some exercise instead. I need it for physical and mental fitness, which have both been lacking lately. So essentially my day will be the same, except with a forced 15-30 minute break in the middle.

<p>I commented on flickr how I love the scheduled snuggle. Stopping in here to say that my husband, too, has scheduled "reading" time in the same location :)</p>
