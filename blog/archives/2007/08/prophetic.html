<h3 class="title">Prophetic</h3>

<p>
I was reading through my archives the other day (invariably I go to look something up, and I end up lost in there, reading sequentially, until the phone or an IM ping bring me back to reality), and I happened upon <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/01/these_dreams.html">this post</a> from January 2005, in which I described a dream:</p>

<blockquote>
I was lying in bed one morning, with the Beaner on his back next to me, looking like his normal six week-old self. He turned to me and said, &quot;Mommy, can we please cuddle?&quot; followed by another phrase I can't remember now. I do remember telling Al what he said later on in the  dream.
</blockquote>
<p>
The reason it jumped out at me is that &quot;Mommy, can we please snuggle?&quot; is something the Beaner says <em>all the time</em>. I turns out I was one word off from prophecy.</p>
