<h3 class="title">More Drawing</h3>

<p>
I think I mentioned somewhere (though I can't find it now, so maybe it was just verbally to Al or a friend) that I was dying to see what the Beaner would draw next, but that I didn't want to influence him at all by suggesting that he draw. I especially didn't want to say, "let's draw" and then have him copy what I did; I wanted to see what he'd come up with on his own.
</p>
<p>
The other day, however, he asked me to draw something, so I drew him. I did as he usually does, and described what I was drawing as I did so. "OK, here's your head... it's kind of squarish. Now I'll put your ears on, and then your eyebrows go here..."
</p>

<p>
"And my face! Don't forget my face!" [Again, here he means mouth.]
</p>

<p>
"OK, I'll get to that in a second..."
</p>

<p>
"And my eyes! Put in my eyes!"
</p>

<p>
"Right, your eyes go here, under your eyebrows. And here's your nose..."
</p>

<p>
[Pointing] "And my face goes HERE."
</p>

<p>
"Right, here's your mouth."
</p>

<p>
"Is that my hair?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep. What do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"It looks like ME!"
</p>

<p>
On Monday, Jess brought the Beaner back from sharecare, and they played in the living room while I finished up a meeting that ran long. When I came down, the Beaner was drawing. (I should see if I can find that drawing now, come to think of it.) "Oh, cool," I said to Jess, "he's starting to put noses on now." She said, "yes, and EYEBROWS! I couldn't believe it when he insisted that his drawing of a face needed eyebrows when he and M were coloring earlier."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," I said, "I wondered if that would happen." And I told her about the drawing I'd done of the Beaner. "Right," she said, "he also added ears!" It seems my theory that I would influence him was correct... at least in the short term. I think I did the drawing of him on Saturday night; on Monday afternoon, he still remembered eyebrows, nose, and ears. Today, however, eyebrows and ears seem less important, though nose has stuck around. Two self-portraits that he drew today (and that Aura left for me):

Another drawing tidbit that was interesting to me: After Jess left on Monday, the Beaner and I sat drawing in the living room for a while. I tried another sketch of him; as far as I was concerned, it looked pretty much the same as the one I'd done on Saturday, only larger and in red pencil rather than green crayon. I also didn't walk him through all the anatomical parts as I was drawing them, and I had a bit more room for an upper body than I did when drawing in his handy-dandy notebook. When I was finished, I said, "who's that?", fully expecting him to say, "me!"
</p>

<p>
"It's Daddy," said the Beaner.

<p>Daddy, eh? Seems you didn't realize the subtle differences in your drawings?! BTW, I was the one you made the comment to about waiting to see what he would draw next.</p>

<p>You are a very wise person, Lori, to watch so closely, to watch every move they make, listen to everything they say....don't even blink...they grow up so fast.</p>

<p>I think it is hilarious that you call your son "Beaner" - we call our son, now 7 months old, Beanie.  When he was born he would sit in his fathers arms and slump into the shape of a bean... I started calling him my Bean, then my Beanie and it stuck.  I can't wait until I have drawings on my refrigerator!!!</p>

<p>I love his drawing skills. They pick up so much, don't they? So cool that just a subtle difference in size prompted him to guess daddy. Smart boy!</p>

<p>I hadn't thought of that, but you're probably right -- it was the larger drawing that made him think it was Daddy and not himself.<br />
