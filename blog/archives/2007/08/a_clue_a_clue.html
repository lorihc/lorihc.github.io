I got out the camera after the Beaner played a marvelous little ditty on his harmonica, but of course once he saw the camera he was more interested in watching the videos I took than playing another song, and so he only tooted out a few half-hearted notes. After several attempts to capture the harmonica playing I said I was giving up...at which point he want back into play mode and did this, hardly aware that the camera was on until it was all over:

[I originally uploaded a Flash Video of this directly to my server, but the sound kept cutting out about 1/3 of the way in. I finally resorted to Vimeo, where the encoding of the video seemed more successful.]<br />

He also tipped over backward in that chair later; he didn't hurt himself, but *man* did he have the scare of his life when he couldn't unwedge himself from between the bookcase and the play table. He was pretty panicked by the time I ran down the stairs from the kitchen to rescue him&#8212;so much so that no sound was coming from his mouth, and it took me a couple seconds to locate him (I'd only heard the thump and the yelp, and did not know what had happened). Once I realized that the chair was down, I fished him out, and after clinging to me like a little monkey for a few seconds, he recovered. He didn't learn his lesson, though: Despite my warnings about keeping all four chair legs on the floor, I caught him tipping back in the chair again within the hour.
