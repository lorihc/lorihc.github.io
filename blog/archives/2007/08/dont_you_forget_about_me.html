<p>
The Beaner's been saying "don't forget for me!" a lot lately. He says it whenever we leave the room, go up or down the stairs, or even turn away from him. He wants to be included, dammit! Don't forget for him! Other variations: "Can I come wit you?" (yeah, it seems he's getting a bit of the Philly accent :-/) and "Can I come TOO?" The answer is usually sure... as long as we don't move at this weird .25 mph pace he's been espousing lately. Luckily, he also likes to run, and if we can make a game of it (as we did when running back from Capogiro), we can make good time *and* get some exercise.
</p>


<p>
...Which reminds me: The Beaner seems to have dropped a couple pounds in the past month. I think this marks the first time he's *lost* weight since the days after his birth. (It's been a steady climb since about day 6.) When I plopped him on the scale in his jammies the other day, he weighed in at 37.5 lbs.

<p>Shmoo has dropped some weight recently, too, and I swear I can see his legs and feet growing right before my eyes. Such an odd transformation. He's also been on the toddler "snake" diet: eat only every 3 days and then gorge. </p>
