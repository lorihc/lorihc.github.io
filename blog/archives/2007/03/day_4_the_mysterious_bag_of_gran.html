<h3 class="title">Day 4: The Mysterious Bag of Granite Samples</h3>

<p>
I assumed that Day 4 would be another Day of Waiting for the Tub, but when I came down to the kitchen to get something to eat around midday, I found a bag of stone and wood samples on our kitchen floor. I hadn't heard anyone come in, which is either frightening (I should really lock the front door when I'm here by myself*), or it means that I've gotten really good at tuning out the daily childcare antics going on downstairs.
</p>

</p>

<p>
In any case, the bag contained two wood samples in natural and sienna cherry (I think we're going with natural), a box of Zodiac quartz samples,  several random pieces of granite (including the large chunk of the one we love, but can't identify), and a few pieces of Travertine (which we need to use for the transition between the tile and wood floor and, I think, for the niche in the shower). Al and I went back and forth on which stone sample would best match the cherry and the paint&#8212;and wouldn't annoy us over the long haul&#8212;and in the end I decided that I really need to see bigger slabs to know for sure. Sometimes the movement of the pattern just isn't visible in a small sample, and since granite is a naturally-occurring product, it's going to vary anyway. Best to say, &quot;that's the EXACT SLAB WE WANT, and we specifically want this 2' x 5' piece right here.&quot;
</p>

The granite we really want. We love that it's just gray. Lots of shades of gray.<br />
No green, no blue, no pink, no brown. Just gray, with chunks of gray in it.
</p>

<p>
What we also need to know for sure is a sample of our floor tile, which was not in the bag. Hopefully a square of that will turn up in the next day or so, perhaps sneaked onto the rug right at the bottom of the stairs to my office without my noticing.
</p>

<p>
* The contractor has a key, of course; what I'd accomplish by locking the door is to keep random strangers from wandering in.
