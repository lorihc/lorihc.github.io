Two unrelated items:

Last night I got some baked beans out for the Beaner to eat with his veggie corn dogs (of which he ate <strong>three</strong>). When I set the bowl of beans down next to his plate and said, "here are your beans!", he replied, "May I have a bib first?" There was a brief pause while I parsed his sentence and then turned to act on it, and, thinking that perhaps his request needed some clarification, he followed up with, "Because I don't want to get beans on my shirt." I'm getting used to the longer, more complex sentences/dialogs, but this one knocked my socks off.

I pinged Al to let him know that our GEICO bill went down $100 this time around. "That's one of the advantages of having an older car," he said. We miss having an easy way to integrate our iPod into the car stereo and seat and mirror position memory, but other than that our 8 year-old Saab fits our needs nicely&#8212;and apparently the insurance to cover it gets cheaper over time.

<p>Get an iTrip for your iPod - it works over your car stereo wirelessly. Not always perfectly, and you have to crank up the volume a bit--but hey, better than nothing...? :-)</p>

<p>Yeah, we have a wireless transmitter now (I think the Belkin one), but it has several drawbacks: </p>

<p>1. You need to find an FM setting that isn't being used. There's not much radio spectrum that isn't being used in this area, which means constant interference -- and constant searching for new, unused spectrum as we drive through Delaware and Maryland on our way to visit the grandparents.</p>

<p>2. Unlike the iTrip, it's battery-powered, and the batteries drain REALLY quickly. I thought the iTrip wasn't so great because it ran on the iPod battery, but that's not really an issue when you also have a car-charger, as we do.</p>

<p>3. As you mentioned, having to crank the volume up so high. It leads to annoying whitenoise (though we've noticed that this is often the case in cars that have direct inputs for MP3 players, too).</p>

<p>I should try the iTrip to see how it compares with the Belkin... although I'm not optimistic because of #1.</p>
