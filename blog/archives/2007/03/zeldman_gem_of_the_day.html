<p>
What is project management?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Client: </strong>Why can't I have that right now?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Designer: </strong>Because it's not ready.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's project management.

<p>Project Management is also:</p>

<p>Client:  Why does this cost an extra $500?</p>

<p>PM:  Because you asked for the task to be completed in 2 days which caused 4 employees to work overtime for the last 5 days, causing an increase in costs.</p>

<p>Client:  But I don't want to pay it</p>

<p>Actually the management is getting people to sign off on the $500 before you do it ;) Explaining (and having them understand) the why its not ready or why it takes more time is the toughest job on any project...</p>

<p>Zeldman gave a couple awesome presentations at AEA. In this one he went on to say a lot more about relationships with clients, including:</p>

<p>- Make sure you're dealing with the decisionmakers -- that there isn't someone above the person you're dealing with who can come in and veto everything you've done, after it's done. (He related a story in which they ended up not getting paid for work they'd done because of this problem.)<br />
- [in response to a question about how to extricate yourself from a bad client relationship] Make sure that it's written into the contract which payments are due from the client when, and what services will be provided by the designer/contractor/whatever in exchange for these payments. In other words, outline the deliverables as clearly as possible, and make it known that at each stage either the client or the designer/contractor/whatever can extricate themselves from the situation without owing the other party anything. I think he said that his standard contract included an up-front payment from the client for initial work.</p>
