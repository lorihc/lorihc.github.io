<h3 class="title">Curry Alert!</h3>

<p>
Just popped out to Trader Joe's to pick up a couple things (and enjoy the sunshine), and I noticed that they now have a Green Tuna Curry in addition to a Yellow and a Red. <a href="http://ratphooey.livejournal.com/">Ratphooey</a> and I agree that the Red is OK and the Yellow is outstanding; the Green is closer to Yellow than Red, IMHO, only without the potatoes. It's also a bit spicier and not quite as thick. I'm eating a bowl of the stuff now over about 1/3 of a bag of TJ's Harvest Vegetable Hodgepodge, and it's delicious. Look for all three varieties of Thai-style tuna curry near the canned fish.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update: </strong>OK, that was amazing down to the last drop. I might even go so far as to say that Green is *better* than Yellow. SO GOOD.

<p>Okay, I took this as an opening to vent a little (okay, a LOT!) - I learned recently that Trader Joe's had made an attempt to open a store in the Denver metro area and had been squeezed out by Whole Foods Market. Plus, I learned that Whole Foods Market would be absorbing our last bastion of locally-owned natural foods stores - Wild Oats. Can I tell you how furious I am? Oh, and how jealous I am that you have Trader Joe's?!?!</p>

<p>I had the Green Tuna Curry for dinner on Monday night and agree that it is absolutely fantastic.  I eat a couple of pouches of the different tuna curries each week, and they are just about my favorite thing in the cabinet.  </p>

<p>I'd forgotten that Wild Oats started in that area. I remember going to the one in Boulder and thinking how crunchy and local it was, so it was a surprise when I started seeing them in other places, too (I think the first was Reno). Now they're national, and considered as predatory as -- if not more so than -- Whole Foods. Example? A Wild Oats opened up right next door to the very local, very independent, VERY crunchy Whole Grocer in Portland, Maine... and I think a Whole Foods is planning to do the same very soon. Annoying.</p>

<p>I consider myself very lucky to live 3 blocks from a TJ's and about 6 from a Whole Foods, though honestly I don't go to the WF that often anymore. Each trip there costs about 3x more than we plan to spend (probably because we base our plan on TJ's prices :). </p>

<p>okay, i'll try the tuna, on your recommendation.  i just wish wf was close by.  the co-op in elk grove closed, and the only other option for organic is raley's, but they don't have the huge selection that wf has.  and my experience with tj's produce, both in n. and s. ca is that it sucks.</p>

<p>yes, produce is an iffy proposition at TJ's. I usually do well with bananas, potatoes, and some apples (which our TJ's has finally started selling individually). I mostly avoid all other unrefrigerated produce, as it comes in large quantities of dubious quality. In the refrigerated section, I've had good luck with green onions, and better luck than at the local ACME (aka Albertson's in CA) with tri-color peppers. Because the quantities at TJ's are usually more than I need, I really have to consider whether I'm saving any money/how badly I really need that celery before I buy.</p>
