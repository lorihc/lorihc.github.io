<h3 class="title">No Really, What Was I Thinking?</h3>

<p>
My to-do list has reached a length&#8212;and the items on it an urgency&#8212;that has brought me back to Outlook's Task List and its useful reminder system. It's time to Get Things Done, and not be paralyzed by this sense that EVERYTHING must be done first.
</p>
<p>
I was going through and deleting all the completed items from the last time I resorted to using Outlook's Task List, and I found an UNcompleted item titled "Girlfriend dreams". It was in the blog category, with a due date of 10/5/06, and I vaguely remember that last fall I had a string of dreams about my female friends that seemed like a pattern. However, these bullet items are doing nothing to jog my memory now:
</p>

<ul>
<li>With Kristin in Germany</li>
<li>Wedding dress/Jeanne</li>
<li>Heart rate, hospital, and yom kippur</li>
<li>Beating Lisa (myself) up while BlogHer was going on, forgetting something important</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Yom Kippur reference is especially puzzling; perhaps it had something to do with Ratphooey's posts about the holiday at the time? No idea.
