<em><strong>Note</strong>: Excuse the flurry of out-of-order postings and whatnot. I've got a bunch of half-written posts on a variety of topics that I'm trying to finish up, and some have more blocking issues associated with them than others. There will also be more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/hawaii/">photos from Hawaii</a> posted later today (or tomorrow, given that I only got 4 hours of sleep last night, and I'm barely functional at the moment).</em>
</p>
<p>
When we got the Beaner out of the shower tonight, I noticed several fresh hives on his back, and one on his left temple. Although the ones on his belly are fading fast, the ones on his legs and hips are not. Argggggh! We'll be writing down everything he eats or touches tomorrow in an effort to gather evidence as to cause.
