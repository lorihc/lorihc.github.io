<h3 class="title">Day 2: It Should be Obvious Now Why We Moved Upstairs to the Guest Room</h3>

<p>
Between doing some research for work on Friday and attending meetings, I was frantically moving all the stuff I thought we would need from the master bedroom upstairs to the guest room. Jack had suggested we move up there during the remodel because of the dust, and I realized that with my parents coming to visit for the weekend and a flight to Boston looming on Sunday afternoon, Friday would be the only day I could do it.
</p>

<p>I think Al was reluctant to move at all, so at first he protested the early leap, but after I explained my logic he agreed that it was a good idea to have a couple nights to try it out before we absolutely HAD to be out. (It turned out to be a good idea for many reasons, not least of which was that we discovered that the new guest mattress was too firm for us; we ended up swapping it for our mattress on Sunday before I left for the airport.) </p>
<p>Looking at our bedroom now, it's impossible to imagine how we ever would have continued sleeping in it while the renovations were going on. The closets are completely taped off (something I knew would happen, and yet didn't adequately prepare for&#8212;though my work-at-home lifestyle could easily support wearing the shirts, jeans, underwear, and socks that were already downstairs in the laundry room, waiting to be washed, Al's work-at-an-office lifestyle cannot), the bed and framed photos are covered in plastic sheeting, and everything else is covered in dust.</p>

<p>
As for the work done on Day 2 (which I got the scoop on when I arrived home from Boston around 9:30pm, in time to take the above photos), the old bathtub is now gone, and the cementboard that will underpin the floor tile has been installed. All the debris from the demo was also removed.
