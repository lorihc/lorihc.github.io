<h3 class="title">You Know What I Hate?</h3>

<p>
5:45pm pediatrician's appointments that end up encroaching on bedtime, that's what. Especially when you wait 90 minutes to see a doctor who pooh-poohs everything you say, does nothing except tell you to do what you're already doing, and then makes you wait another 15 minutes for your paperwork. I'm convinced that last wait would have been longer if the Beaner and I hadn't exited the exam room and plunked ourselves in front of the nurses' station, in full view of the doctor; she sort of gave a start when she finished her conversation with a nurse and saw us, reached for our paperwork (which had been sitting on the printer forever), signed a prescription, and handed the pages to us. GAH.
</p>


<p>
For the record, the Beaner is fine. We noticed he was warm the morning we left for Hawaii, and by the time we reached Chicago it was obvious he had a raging fever. We bought some Children's Motrin at a newsstand in the airport and dosed him every 4-6 hours with it (interval depended on when his temp seemed to be going back up). After a second day of fever we took him to a doc in Hawaii, who pronounced that one ear was infected and the other was on its way. The doc gave us Amoxicillin (which the Beaner also took the previous two times he's had ear infections).
</p>

<p>
On Monday night (this past Monday, more than a week after he started the antibiotics), the Beaner woke up screaming at about 11pm, and I was unable to console him for about 10-15 minutes. He didn't want to sit up, lie down, or let go of me.
I asked him if he hurt, and he shook his head. I asked Al if anything unusual had happened that evening (I'd been out at hockey practice during the bath &amp; bed routine), and he said the Beaner had had some bugbite-like bumps on him, but other than that, nothing out of the ordinary.
</p>

<p>
I finally got the Beaner to lie down with me, and I noticed that he was scratching a bit before I dozed off. I ended up sleeping with him all night... and totally oversleeping in the morning. I didn't realize it until I brought him downstairs to find our bed made, Al gone, and the clock reading 9:40am. &quot;Aura?&quot; I called, and she responded from downstairs. I quickly got dressed for work while she fed the Beaner breakfast. At about 10:30 she called upstairs to ask if she should give the Beaner some of the medicine in the fridge. I thought, &quot;oh crap, that's right&#8212;Al couldn't have given him his morning dose of medicine because the Beaner was still asleep,&quot; and went down to dose him. That's when Aura mentioned the rash, and I saw it for the first time.
</p>

<p>
What the Beaner had all over his chest and hips were hives. They weren't super fresh hives, but I put a little cortisone on him anyway, and then I went back upstairs. About an hour later, the Beaner finally consented to get dressed, and Aura informed me that the hives were now all over his back and down his legs. That's when I called the doctor to find out what to do. The nurse told me to give him Benydryl, which was totally logical; not sure why I hadn't thought of it (maybe because we don't have any? I take Zyrtec for my allergies...), and asked us to come in to see the doctor at 5:45pm. That's where the aforementioned fun began.
</p>

<p>
Right now we're all assuming that he had a reaction to the Amoxicillin, given that the hives developed (and worsened) after doses of the stuff. However, it *is* a little odd that he would have a reaction on day 10 of the medication, especially when he's had it before. My harebrained, half-witted idea is that maybe the medication became contaminated by a not-washed-well-enough medicine dropper, and that some new mold/bacteria/fungus/whatever grew in there, and *that's* what he had a reaction to. Either way, we've thrown out the Amoxicillin, and his chart now has a note about a suspected penecillin allergy. 
</p>

<p>
After another dose of Benedryl at bedtime, the Beaner's hives are now no longer swollen and white-centered; instead, they look like the aftermath of a picked zit (or rather, about 100 of them): His chest, back, armpits, hips, and legs are covered by irregular red patches. Hopefully these will fade some more today, and he'll be fine again tomorrow. In the meantime, I have a prescription for the liquid form of Zyrtec, which I can employ if the hives return.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Hives: The Return</h3>

<p>
<em><strong>Note</strong>: Excuse the flurry of out-of-order postings and whatnot. I've got a bunch of half-written posts on a variety of topics that I'm trying to finish up, and some have more blocking issues associated with them than others. There will also be more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/hawaii/">photos from Hawaii</a> posted later today (or tomorrow, given that I only got 4 hours of sleep last night, and I'm barely functional at the moment).</em>
</p>

<p>
When we got the Beaner out of the shower tonight, I noticed several fresh hives on his back, and one on his left temple. Although the ones on his belly are fading fast, the ones on his legs and hips are not. Argggggh! We'll be writing down everything he eats or touches tomorrow in an effort to gather evidence as to cause.

<h3 class="title">Chew, Chew, Chew</h3>

<p>
While we were waiting to see the doctor on Tuesday evening, I taught the Beaner how to chew gum. I did it mainly because his breath smelled so foul I couldn't stand it anymore (something I need to ask the dentist about when I finally get around to making his first dental appointment). Although we brush his teeth at least once a day (and sometimes twice), we're obviously missing something, and I figured maybe some sugarless gum would have a positive effect on his overall mouth freshness, and possibly its health.
</p>

<p>
I stuck a piece of Bubblemint Orbit into my own mouth and demonstrated chewing without swallowing. "See? See how Mommy's chewing the gum&#8212;yummy gum!&#8212;but not swallowing it? I just keep chewing. Chew, chew, chew." After doing this, I realized that an entire stick would be way too big for his toddler mouth, so I tore a piece in half, unwrapped it, and handed it over. "Now you: Chew, chew, chew, but don't swallow!"
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Gum," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"Gim?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, <em>gim</em> is green. Gim is seaweed. You eat it with your <em>bop</em>," I clarified.
</p>

<p>
We went back and forth on the difference between gim and gum and which one this was a few times, and then he chewed and chewed and smiled and chewed. When I was sure he had the hang of it, I let him return to playing with the other kids in the waiting room and started texting Al about the gum success. In the middle of thumbing out my text message, the Beaner yelled, "more gum!"
</p>

<p>
"You didn't swallow it, did you?"
</p>

<p>
"YES!"
</p>

<p>
I had to modify my text message slightly.
</p>

<p>
We tried again with the other half of the stick in the exam room, once it became obvious that (a) the Beaner's breath was still terrible, and (b) the doctor wasn't coming in anytime soon. With him sitting on my lap, we reviewed the basics:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Chew.</li>
<li>Chew.</li>
<li>Chew.</li>
<li>Do not swallow.</li>
<li>Chew some more.</li>
<li>When the gum loses its flavor or you get tired of chewing, spit the gum in the trash or hand it to Mommy.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This time the Beaner really got it. He chewed and chewed and chewed. Whenever he'd stop chewing, I'd ask to see the gum to make sure he hadn't swallowed it, and he obliged. He tried to get the mechanics of bubble-blowing, but he couldn't put the tongue-and-blow parts together (not surprising). Something to aspire to, I guess.
</p>

<p>
Finally the doctor came in, and we started going over the chronology of the hives and the antibiotics and whatnot. That's the moment the Beaner chose to remove the gum from his mouth and hold it up to my face. "I'm done, Mommy!" he said. That's my boy.
</p>

<p>
This morning, as I got out the ingredients for my breakfast&#8212;tuna masubi, the recipe for which follows below&#8212;the Beaner pointed to the package of gim in my hand and said, "gum?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I said, "this is <em>gim</em>."
</p>

<p>
"Gim is green," said the Beaner. "Gum is pink."
</p>

<p>
"Gim is always green," I clarified, "but gum is not always pink. The gum you had the other day was pink, though."
</p>

<p>
It's so cool to see him trying to describe his world this way. What are the absolutes? Which properties are relative? Tangentially related, this morning the Beaner had the following dialogue with himself: "This is my Saab. Where is Daddy's Saab? He lost it. At grandpa Cho's house."
</p>

<p class="sep" ><!-- --></p>

<p>
<strong>Tuna Masubi</strong>
</p>

<p>
1 sheet gim or sushi nori<br />
1/2 container microwave white or brown rice<br />
dash of furikake (optional)<br />
1/4-1/3 can Trader Joe's olive oil-packed tuna
</p>

<p>
The first three ingredients are definitely available at H Mart, a Korean grocery store, and may also be available at other Asian markets. I like the sesame oiled-and-salted gim, but you can use sushi Nori instead. I would not recommend using the TJ's microwave-in-bag rice; it's not sticky enough. The furikake is optional if you're using oiled-and-salted gim, but I think with plain nori it's really necessary. You want the kind with nori bits, sesame seeds, salt, and sugar in it.
</p>

<p>
Microwave rice according to package directions. Lay out the gim or nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Open the can of tuna and drain the oil. When the rice is ready, scoop out half of it with a fork and spread as thinly as possible on the gim or nori. Leave a bit of a margin at one end; there'll be a much larger one at the other end because you'll run out of rice. You can use more rice if you want, but I find that 1/2 a container is usually plenty.
</p>

<p>
Scoop out some tuna and spread out over the center of the rice, again leaving margins on both sides. Sprinkle with furikake, if using. Finally, roll up the gim or nori using the mat, just as you would a piece of sushi, squeezing as you go. Let rest for a minute or two to allow the steam from the rice and the weight of the roll to seal the gim.
</p>

<p>
I guess this is really more of a tuna maki rather than a tuna masubi, but the ingredients are basically the same as the Home Maid Bakery used in their tuna masubis when I got them at Kapalua's Honolua Store last year (they weren't available this year, sadly), so that's what I call it. I don't slice it as you would sushi; instead, I just eat it like a stick of string cheese.
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Certification We've Been Waiting For</h3>

<p>
It's entirely possible that this will only be amusing to me and to the people with whom I work (as opposed to the people who actually read my blog), but Joseph Cooney has come up with the certification program every developer has been eagerly awaiting: <a href="http://jcooney.net/archive/2007/02/01/42999.aspx">The "It Works On My Machine" certification</a>. W00t!

<h3 class="title">No Really, What Was I Thinking?</h3>

<p>
My to-do list has reached a length&#8212;and the items on it an urgency&#8212;that has brought me back to Outlook's Task List and its useful reminder system. It's time to Get Things Done, and not be paralyzed by this sense that EVERYTHING must be done first.
</p>

<p>
I was going through and deleting all the completed items from the last time I resorted to using Outlook's Task List, and I found an UNcompleted item titled "Girlfriend dreams". It was in the blog category, with a due date of 10/5/06, and I vaguely remember that last fall I had a string of dreams about my female friends that seemed like a pattern. However, these bullet items are doing nothing to jog my memory now:
</p>

<ul>
<li>With Kristin in Germany</li>
<li>Wedding dress/Jeanne</li>
<li>Heart rate, hospital, and yom kippur</li>
<li>Beating Lisa (myself) up while BlogHer was going on, forgetting something important</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Yom Kippur reference is especially puzzling; perhaps it had something to do with Ratphooey's posts about the holiday at the time? No idea.

<h3 class="title">Still Evolving, Apparently</h3>

<p>
I've been reading the surprisingly absorbing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCryptonomicon-Neal-Stephenson%2Fdp%2F0060512806%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1171836864%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Cryptonomicon</a>, and the other night I came across this paragraph, which hit me like a sledgehammer:
</p>



<blockquote>
  Chester nods all the way through this, but does not rudely interrupt Randy as a younger nerd would. Your younger nerd takes offense quickly when someone near him begins to utter declarative sentences, because he reads into it an assertion that he, the nerd, does not already know the information being imparted. But your older nerd has more self-confidence, and besides, understands that frequently people need to think out loud. And highly advanced nerds will furthermore understand that uttering declarative sentences whose contents are already known to all present is part of the social process of making conversation and therefore should not be construed as aggression under any circumstances.  
</blockquote>

<p>
Why did this hit me like a sledgehammer? Because I recognized myself. I take offense for exactly this reason way on more occasions than I should. So while I am an older nerd, certainly, it appears that I am not yet a highly advanced nerd. The good news here is that when I related this self-discovery to Al, he found it utterly hilarious... and now we can sidestep possible arguments by alluding to this nerd phenomenon, usually by pointing out that "what we're doing here? It's called 'conversation'."

<h3 class="title">Curry Alert!</h3>

<p>
Just popped out to Trader Joe's to pick up a couple things (and enjoy the sunshine), and I noticed that they now have a Green Tuna Curry in addition to a Yellow and a Red. <a href="http://ratphooey.livejournal.com/">Ratphooey</a> and I agree that the Red is OK and the Yellow is outstanding; the Green is closer to Yellow than Red, IMHO, only without the potatoes. It's also a bit spicier and not quite as thick. I'm eating a bowl of the stuff now over about 1/3 of a bag of TJ's Harvest Vegetable Hodgepodge, and it's delicious. Look for all three varieties of Thai-style tuna curry near the canned fish.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update: </strong>OK, that was amazing down to the last drop. I might even go so far as to say that Green is *better* than Yellow. SO GOOD.

<h3 class="title">Observant</h3>

<p>
When we took the Beaner in for his two-year checkup last Friday, our pediatrician was half giddy, half amazed as his verbal and cognitive abilities. I tend to discount any assertions that the Beaner is smart, precocious, advanced for his age, etc. because really, who cares? If he's any of those things, the only reason to be glad of it is because it makes him a better conversationalist and more fun to be around on a daily basis. It's not like he's going to be applying to Harvard any time soon.
</p>

<p>
And besides, "advanced for his age" is <em>really</em> relative. Our doc said, "you don't realize how advanced he is because you have no one to compare him to. Wait until he goes to school." Now, technically, we *do* have other kids to compare him to&#8212;and all of them are at about the same level as the Beaner (at the same age), with some being slightly more verbal, others being slightly more musical, and so on. Maybe it's because our friends who are having kids right now are all wicked smart engineers, musicians, scientists, writers, or a combination of one or more of those? Maybe it's that all of these smart, accomplished parents actually talk to and play with their kids? Maybe it's that we all had kids when we were slightly older than *our* parents were, when we were more established, more able to provide for them, more able to arrange our schedules around them?
</p>

<p>
Who knows&#8212;and again, who cares?
</p>

<p>
Of course, now that I've said all that, LET ME TELL YOU HOW SMART MY KID IS. No, I'm just kidding. I mostly want to record that we're seeing more and more examples of him pointing out facts and details about his world like a crime scene technician circling shell casings and labeling lint. It's so neat to see him processing, thinking about how Fact 1 + Fact 2 must mean Fact 3 (even if he draws the wrong conclusion, which is often hilarious). He's also comparing things, which didn't strike me as odd until I heard him do it for about the fifth time this week. (This morning he said, "that pan is hot?", and when I said yes, he held up the pancake I'd flipped out of the pan about two minutes before and said, "this pancake is cooler?")
</p>

<p>
Yesterday morning, while Al was getting ready to catch a plane, I was getting ready for work, and the Beaner was running around the bedroom half-dressed, the Beaner said, "I have brown eyes."
</p>

<p>
Al: "Yes, you do."
</p>

<p>
Beaner: [You know what's coming here, right?] "Why?"
</p>

<p>
Al: "Because I have brown eyes."
</p>

<p>
Me, shouting from bathroom: "That's how genetics works: Brown eyes are dominant."
</p>

<p>
Al: "What color are mommy's eyes?"
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "Green."
</p>

<p>
Al: (to me) "Did you tell him that?"
</p>

<p>
Me: "No."
</p>

<p>
Which I guess just proves that the Beaner's eyes are not only brown, but also that they work.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Neatness Counts (And So Does Age)</h3>

<p>
Two unrelated items:
</p>

<p>
Last night I got some baked beans out for the Beaner to eat with his veggie corn dogs (of which he ate <strong>three</strong>). When I set the bowl of beans down next to his plate and said, "here are your beans!", he replied, "May I have a bib first?" There was a brief pause while I parsed his sentence and then turned to act on it, and, thinking that perhaps his request needed some clarification, he followed up with, "Because I don't want to get beans on my shirt." I'm getting used to the longer, more complex sentences/dialogs, but this one knocked my socks off.
</p>

<p>
I pinged Al to let him know that our GEICO bill went down $100 this time around. "That's one of the advantages of having an older car," he said. We miss having an easy way to integrate our iPod into the car stereo and seat and mirror position memory, but other than that our 8 year-old Saab fits our needs nicely&#8212;and apparently the insurance to cover it gets cheaper over time.

<h3 class="title">Hello?</h3>

<p>
While Al and I were in the kitchen cleaning out the refrigerator in preparation for Trash Night, the Beaner turned to his toy drawer to amuse himself. He pulled out his little Fisher-Price phone, held the receiver to his ear, and said, "Hi! My name is {Beaner}. What's your name?" Next he held the receiver out to me and said, "Do you wanna talk to the li'l boy?"

<h3 class="title">Reflexes</h3>

<p>
Last night we took my parents out for a fabulous meal at one of our favorite restaurants, Goji Tokyo Cuisine. My mom loves food but is not an adventurous eater, so she chose the rather safe shrimp and vegetable tempura. My dad loves to try new things (and return to favorites that he can only get when visiting me in whatever city I happen to be living in), so he branched out a little and chose an avocado-cucumber roll, a shrimp tempura roll, and a pickled vegetable roll. Al had the excellent hog katsu, and I think I had the best meal of all (though everyone else would probably argue the same for their dishes): a Tropical Roll (tuna, mango, avocado, spicy sauce, and three kinds of tobiko) and a Sea Dragon roll (shrimp tempura and avocado topped with spicy kani salad). Outstanding.
</p>

<p>
When dad's avocado-cucumber roll came out, he asked mom if she'd like to try one. She said no thanks, and then, with a lightning-fast grab for the wasabi, she continued, "I'll just have this." I started to yell, "NO!", but I've lost most of my voice to a cold, and I couldn't intercept her with my hands because they were full of chopsticks and a napkin. My dad's reflexes, however, were even faster than my mom's. He managed to block her arm as she was moving to stuff the wad of wasabi into her mouth, and it went flying. Mom looked stunned, as I'm sure we all did. "DON'T EAT THAT!" my dad said sharply. And then, as my mom continued to look confused, he said, "What did you do with it???"
</p>

<p>
At this point I was laughing too hard to tell them where it was, so I just moved my plate aside so they could see it. I'd watched it come at me, so I'd seen where it landed. Al scooped it up and put it back on the plate, and dad apologized for whacking mom's arm while explaining that the move was designed to save her considerable pain and shock.
</p>

<p>
We all had a good laugh over it, especially me&#8212;because I'm convinced that this story will now supersede the one that my parents have been telling for years, about the time I stuffed the nose of my IHOP Funny Face pancake into my mouth, thinking it was ice cream. For mom's part, she made <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/03/yeeeesssss.html#wasabi">the same mistake the Beaner once did</a>: she thought the wasabi was an extra lump of avocado.

<h3 class="title">Day 1: Not There</h3>

<p>
When Al asked me last night if I'd taken any "before" photos of our master bath, I realized that I wouldn't be around to take Day 1 and Day 2 photos and describe what happened, as I did with our <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/archives/kitchen_remodel/">kitchen remodel</a>. Yes, that's right, our master bath remodel is STARTING TODAY!!!
</p>

<p>
We're still trying to find a countertop; the granite Al and I both liked best turned out to be a scrap from a one-of-a-kind slab of which the granite fabricator does not know the name (and doesn't stock). We really need to get a sample of our tile, a small piece of wood stained the cabinet color, and a paint swatch, and try again with the granite selection. Hopefully that'll happen this week or next.
</p>

<p>
Since I'm in Boston until late tomorrow night, Al's going to try to snap a couple photos of the day's progress for me tonight, and then I'll try to remember to get a couple when I get home tomorrow. Stay tuned.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Day 1: Demo</h3>

<p>
Al came through with some cameraphone photos of the Day 1 work, which consisted entirely of demo. I don't know why I'm surprised that they managed to strip most of the bathroom (save for the tub) to the studs in such a short time, but I am.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

The view from the doorway. The black bit on the floor is where the toilet goes; it'll be coming back, because it's relatively new.

The debris from the vanity and wall removal, stacked in the tub.

Where the too-low vanity once stood. Although there are hookups for two sinks, we only had one (on the left); the new design will also incorporate only one sink, in the center.

<h3 class="title">Day 2: It Should be Obvious Now Why We Moved Upstairs to the Guest Room</h3>

<p>
Between doing some research for work on Friday and attending meetings, I was frantically moving all the stuff I thought we would need from the master bedroom upstairs to the guest room. Jack had suggested we move up there during the remodel because of the dust, and I realized that with my parents coming to visit for the weekend and a flight to Boston looming on Sunday afternoon, Friday would be the only day I could do it.
</p>


<p>I think Al was reluctant to move at all, so at first he protested the early leap, but after I explained my logic he agreed that it was a good idea to have a couple nights to try it out before we absolutely HAD to be out. (It turned out to be a good idea for many reasons, not least of which was that we discovered that the new guest mattress was too firm for us; we ended up swapping it for our mattress on Sunday before I left for the airport.) </p>
<p>Looking at our bedroom now, it's impossible to imagine how we ever would have continued sleeping in it while the renovations were going on. The closets are completely taped off (something I knew would happen, and yet didn't adequately prepare for&#8212;though my work-at-home lifestyle could easily support wearing the shirts, jeans, underwear, and socks that were already downstairs in the laundry room, waiting to be washed, Al's work-at-an-office lifestyle cannot), the bed and framed photos are covered in plastic sheeting, and everything else is covered in dust.</p>

</p>

<p>
As for the work done on Day 2 (which I got the scoop on when I arrived home from Boston around 9:30pm, in time to take the above photos), the old bathtub is now gone, and the cementboard that will underpin the floor tile has been installed. All the debris from the demo was also removed.

<h3 class="title">Day 3: Waiting For the Tub</h3>

<p>
One of the workmen stopped by this morning to pick up some tools. I should have introduced myself and gotten his name, but I didn't, mainly because I had no voice at all when he arrived, and I didn't feel like trying to make myself understood.
</p>

<p>
Al talked to him for a couple minutes and ascertained that there would be no work going on today, as they are waiting for the new tub to arrive. The tile has come in, however, and I think Jack said that he'd bring some by so we could use it&#8212;along with a swatch of the wall color that Al tore off the drywall debris&#8212;to help us pick out a granite for the countertop.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of the wall color, we need to get some more of it pretty soon, as Jack's going to have us paint before he puts in the vanity (and maybe the tile?), and the new drywall will be going in after the tub is installed, I think. Jack said he regretted not letting us paint the kitchen before he installed the cabinets, so he's going to correct that mistake this time around. For what it's worth, we didn't even pick out a paint color for the kitchen until it was finished, though I'm sure if pressed, I could have done it. This time we're just going to paint the bathroom the same color it was before (i.e., the same color as the bedroom), so we don't have to agonize over color chips. We just have to get Lowe's to mix us the something that matches our partial can!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Damn the Scheduling System at Toppers Spa!</h3>

<p>
Last week I called Toppers Spa here in Philadelphia (the one on 19th Street) to make an appointment with my favorite massage therapist, Regina, whom I visit monthly. I've learned that it's impossible to schedule my next month's appointment directly after my massage because Regina's not in the system. (My theory is that they save her for last-minute appointments, based on my experience of being able to get one with her with less than 24 hours' notice.)
</p>

<p>
Last week I was a bit sore after our hockey playoffs, so I tried to make an appointment for Wednesday by calling on Monday or Tuedsay. No dice: Regina wasn't in the system. I was put on hold for a while, and then the scheduler came back to say that the reason was that Regina was only working on Saturdays and Sundays now. I'd been told this before a few months back, and when I mentioned it to Regina, she said, "oh, no&#8212;I'm here every day except Thursday!" So anyway, I knew this information to be wrong, so I said I'd check my schedule and call back.
</p>

<p>
My schedule for the rest of the week was full, and I was away at An Event Apart in Boston on Monday and Tuesday of this week, so my plan was to call today for an appointment tomorrw morning. I got one, but not before the blurry vision that preceeds a migraine started. (I can only see about every third word of what I'm typing right now, so excuse any typos.) In case you were wondering, the reason I get a massage every month is TO AVOID MIGRAINES. The fact that I'm getting one now means I waited too long.
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, it's nice to know that I'm in tune enough with my body to know that I needed a massage three weeks after the last one&#8212;due to additional stresses on my neck, back, and shoulders&#8212;instead of four. On the other hand, the fact that I was thwarted in actually getting that massage when I knew I needed it is annoying the piss out of me.
</p>

<p>
Excuse me while I try to release the annoyance and sleep off the migraine. Hopefully all will be better after tomorrow's 9am appointment.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Day 4: The Mysterious Bag of Granite Samples</h3>

<p>
I assumed that Day 4 would be another Day of Waiting for the Tub, but when I came down to the kitchen to get something to eat around midday, I found a bag of stone and wood samples on our kitchen floor. I hadn't heard anyone come in, which is either frightening (I should really lock the front door when I'm here by myself*), or it means that I've gotten really good at tuning out the daily childcare antics going on downstairs.
</p>



<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/439780884/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/175/439780884_0efe7b98b8.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="the mysterious bag of granite samples" /></a>
</p>

<p>
In any case, the bag contained two wood samples in natural and sienna cherry (I think we're going with natural), a box of Zodiac quartz samples,  several random pieces of granite (including the large chunk of the one we love, but can't identify), and a few pieces of Travertine (which we need to use for the transition between the tile and wood floor and, I think, for the niche in the shower). Al and I went back and forth on which stone sample would best match the cherry and the paint&#8212;and wouldn't annoy us over the long haul&#8212;and in the end I decided that I really need to see bigger slabs to know for sure. Sometimes the movement of the pattern just isn't visible in a small sample, and since granite is a naturally-occurring product, it's going to vary anyway. Best to say, &quot;that's the EXACT SLAB WE WANT, and we specifically want this 2' x 5' piece right here.&quot;
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/439820521/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/159/439820521_11a7504833.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="the granite we love (2)" /></a><br />
The granite we really want. We love that it's just gray. Lots of shades of gray.<br />
No green, no blue, no pink, no brown. Just gray, with chunks of gray in it.
</p>

<p>
What we also need to know for sure is a sample of our floor tile, which was not in the bag. Hopefully a square of that will turn up in the next day or so, perhaps sneaked onto the rug right at the bottom of the stairs to my office without my noticing.
</p>

<p>
* The contractor has a key, of course; what I'd accomplish by locking the door is to keep random strangers from wandering in.

<h3 class="title">Day 5: Tile Delivery</h3>

<p>
The tile showed up today (though Steve, the guy who delivered it, wasn't sure when it would be installed). I *think* the tub has to go in first, but I'm not sure myself.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

</p>

<p>
The good news is that with the tile sample, we have a better idea of which granite will work&#8212;and which ones won't. I think the surprising frontrunner now is a sample of sapphire blue. Stay tuned.
