<h3 class="title">Damn the Scheduling System at Toppers Spa!</h3>

<p>
Last week I called Toppers Spa here in Philadelphia (the one on 19th Street) to make an appointment with my favorite massage therapist, Regina, whom I visit monthly. I've learned that it's impossible to schedule my next month's appointment directly after my massage because Regina's not in the system. (My theory is that they save her for last-minute appointments, based on my experience of being able to get one with her with less than 24 hours' notice.)
</p>
<p>
Last week I was a bit sore after our hockey playoffs, so I tried to make an appointment for Wednesday by calling on Monday or Tuedsay. No dice: Regina wasn't in the system. I was put on hold for a while, and then the scheduler came back to say that the reason was that Regina was only working on Saturdays and Sundays now. I'd been told this before a few months back, and when I mentioned it to Regina, she said, "oh, no&#8212;I'm here every day except Thursday!" So anyway, I knew this information to be wrong, so I said I'd check my schedule and call back.
</p>

<p>
My schedule for the rest of the week was full, and I was away at An Event Apart in Boston on Monday and Tuesday of this week, so my plan was to call today for an appointment tomorrw morning. I got one, but not before the blurry vision that preceeds a migraine started. (I can only see about every third word of what I'm typing right now, so excuse any typos.) In case you were wondering, the reason I get a massage every month is TO AVOID MIGRAINES. The fact that I'm getting one now means I waited too long.
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, it's nice to know that I'm in tune enough with my body to know that I needed a massage three weeks after the last one&#8212;due to additional stresses on my neck, back, and shoulders&#8212;instead of four. On the other hand, the fact that I was thwarted in actually getting that massage when I knew I needed it is annoying the piss out of me.
</p>

<p>
Excuse me while I try to release the annoyance and sleep off the migraine. Hopefully all will be better after tomorrow's 9am appointment.

<p>Have you ever tried the nice folks at Balance?  They rock.  Great massages.  And cheaper than Toppers, IIRC.</p>

<p>I haven't. I meant to, but I never got around to it... and then I found Regina. She's so right for me that I'm willing to jump through the scheduling hoops to get her. Those hoops just royally screwed me this time (and one other).</p>

<p>Yes, annoying when the things that are supposed to reduce stress actually cause some!</p>
