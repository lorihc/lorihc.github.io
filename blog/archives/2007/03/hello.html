<h3 class="title">Hello?</h3>

<p>
While Al and I were in the kitchen cleaning out the refrigerator in preparation for Trash Night, the Beaner turned to his toy drawer to amuse himself. He pulled out his little Fisher-Price phone, held the receiver to his ear, and said, "Hi! My name is {Beaner}. What's your name?" Next he held the receiver out to me and said, "Do you wanna talk to the li'l boy?"

<p>Oh, thank goodness it was a toy phone. ;-) Mine decided to "call Daddy" using the real phone. He dialed a number and reached a man who was most definitely NOT Daddy! Fortunately, he must have been <i>someone</i>'s daddy, for he was very understanding.</p>
