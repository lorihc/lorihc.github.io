<h3 class="title">Day 3: Waiting For the Tub</h3>

<p>
One of the workmen stopped by this morning to pick up some tools. I should have introduced myself and gotten his name, but I didn't, mainly because I had no voice at all when he arrived, and I didn't feel like trying to make myself understood.
</p>
<p>
Al talked to him for a couple minutes and ascertained that there would be no work going on today, as they are waiting for the new tub to arrive. The tile has come in, however, and I think Jack said that he'd bring some by so we could use it&#8212;along with a swatch of the wall color that Al tore off the drywall debris&#8212;to help us pick out a granite for the countertop.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of the wall color, we need to get some more of it pretty soon, as Jack's going to have us paint before he puts in the vanity (and maybe the tile?), and the new drywall will be going in after the tub is installed, I think. Jack said he regretted not letting us paint the kitchen before he installed the cabinets, so he's going to correct that mistake this time around. For what it's worth, we didn't even pick out a paint color for the kitchen until it was finished, though I'm sure if pressed, I could have done it. This time we're just going to paint the bathroom the same color it was before (i.e., the same color as the bedroom), so we don't have to agonize over color chips. We just have to get Lowe's to mix us the something that matches our partial can!
