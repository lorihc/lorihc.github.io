<h3 class="title">Winsha is Short, Lori is Tall</h3>

<p>
OK, obviously I'm behind on blogging&#8212;after a week running around San Francisco meeting friends and former work colleagues for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and meeting current work colleagues for, well, <em>meetings</em>, I have a gazillion photos to upload and a few stories to tell. I also have the day off, but I chose to get a massage this morning to help mitigate the after-effects of Friday's migraine, vacuum the remodeling dust off every surface in the house, get caught up on laundry, file my expenses, deposit some checks that arrived while I was gone, upload some of the gazillion photos, sync my personal Outlook, work Outlook, and kitchen paper calendars with Al's hockey and my travel schedules, and have a beer rather than blog... until right now. Yes, with about 15 minutes until the Beaner and his sharecare nanny come through the door, I've decided to tell one of my SF stories.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday I had lunch with my friend and former colleague Winsha (she's now on the Flex Builder team, while I stayed on the Dreamweaver team). After lunch we stopped at the new-to-me Starbucks at Townsend &amp; 8th, where Winsha ordered a short latte and I ordered a decaf double-tall latte.
</p>

<p>
The friendly woman behind the counter said, "can I have your names?" with Sharpie poised. I replied, "Winsha&#8212;W-I-N-S-H-A&#8212;is short, Lori is tall." And then Winsha and I totally cracked up. I proposed that we take a photo of ourselves and then the finished drinks, so everyone else could get the joke too. My self-portrait mojo was totally missing on this day, sadly, so this is the best I could do:

Winsha is short, Lori is tall
</p>

<p>
The missing self-portrait mojo wasn't the worst of it, though. It turns out that the lovely woman behind the counter stomped on the punch line by reversing the drinks. (Geez, that was the point: that the mnemonic was so EASY!) Oh well.

all evidence to the contrary, Winsha is short, Lori is tall

<p>Glad you had fun in SF! Next time you are in town, I shall take you for a Starbucks. And since I am short, it should work out... ;-)</p>
