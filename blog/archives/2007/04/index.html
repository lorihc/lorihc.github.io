<h3 class="title">Day 6: A Brief Trip to Gravena</h3>

<p>
We went out to <a href="http://www.gravenatile.com/">Gravena</a> yesterday before the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/baseball/">baseball game</a> to see if we could find a slab of granite that matched the sample we liked, but we struck out. You need an appointment to see the slabs in the yard on Saturdays, and we didn't have one. We did look through enough samples in the showroom, however, to know that the sapphire blue sample that's at the top of our list... well, is still at the top of our list.

<h3 class="title">Chicken Soup for the Vegetarian</h3>

<p>
Tonight I did something I haven't done in almost 20 years. Well, two things. First: I made chicken soup (for Al, who was wishing yesterday that he had some to help him fight off a cold). Second: I ate some.
</p>

<p>
I stopped eating red meat in the fall of 1987, when I was a sophmore in college. I continued to eat poultry for almost a year after that, but then it got so chicken and turkey tasted like meat, too. I almost got to the point where I gave up seafood as well, but I had a chat with my tastebuds and my psyche wherein I explained to them that I had grown up on seafood (in New England), that it was an easy way to get enough protein, and that I planned to have my (non-bacon-infused) chowder and broiled scallops and fried Haddock as long as they were available to me. (I hadn't started eating sushi yet&#8212;I didn't discover that until the early 90s&#8212;but I'm glad we had that talk before sushi and I were introduced.)
</p>

<p>
Aside from a small nibble of ham and one of chicken while I was pregnant to see if they appealed (they didn't), I haven't knowingly eaten any non-seafood meat since 1988, if memory serves. Until tonight. Without thinking too hard about it, I decided to taste the chicken after I removed it from the soup pot. It was actually quite good! I'd used an organic, had-access-to-the-great-outdoors-but-never-actually-went-outdoors chicken from Trader Joes, and I'd simmered it with some onions, carrots, celery, fresh parsely, and a bit of dried rosemary and thyme. I didn't add any salt because I hadn't planned on tasting it to check the salt levels; I figured I'd leave that to Al.
</p>

<p>
So anyway, the chicken tasted very mild, and not at all like the over-processed, over-salted mechanized death that I'd come to expect chicken to taste like, based on the smell I associate with KFC and some of the rotisserie chickens all brings home. So I ate a bit more. In all, I probably ate about six small shreds of meat, plus a small bowl of broth and vegetables over egg noodles. (The broth did need salt, but honestly, the chicken itself tasted much better without any.)
</p>

<p>
My stomach feels a tad sour now, but other than that I seem to be processing this foreign food OK. Whether I'll eat any more tomorrow (or ever again) remains to be seen, but I don't regret eating what I did tonight. (Although I couldn't seem to get the phrase, "<a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/490/Meat_is_Murder_Tasty_Tasty_Murder">meat is murder. tasty, tasty murder</a>" out of my head the whole time I was chewing.)
</p>

<h3 class="title">Day 8: Tile Planning, Pipe Re-Routing, and Tub Delivery</h3>

<p>
Nothing happened on Day 7 (a Sunday), so I skipped it, but today there was a flurry of activity in the bathroom. Jack consulted me about how I wanted the tiles to be laid (I'm leaning toward diagonal on the floor and straight on the wall, but Al thinks straight for both would be better), and where the soap and shampoo niches should go in the shower; Ken worked on making the two left and right sink hookups into one center one; a hole was drilled in the Wonderboard to accommodate the tub drain; and Ken opened a flap in the duct work so he and Jack could see if threading some coax through it to wire the guest room for cable would be feasible.
</p>

<p>
The big (and I mean that literally) news for the day: the new tub was delivered. It stayed where it was dropped off, however&#8212;in our entrance hall&#8212;because it was too heavy for Jack and Ken to move by themselves.

<h3 class="title">Day 9: Tub Installation and Cabling</h3>

<p>
Jack's son Rylan and Rylan's friend (or just associate? I'm not sure, but he was nice) Jeremy showed up around 9:30 this morning. When I saw the two of them at the door, I knew that they were the reinforcements necessary to move the tub upstairs. Jack and Ken came a few minutes later, and together the four of them shimmied and tugged and hauled and wedged the tub up to the living room, then up to the master bedroom, and then into the master bath. Rylan and Jeremy departed once the tub was in place, and Jack and Ken did the final work to seat it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
After the tub went in there was lots of sawing and drilling and other loud noises, as well as a consultation with Jack about where the coax cable should come up into the guest bedroom. I find that when I poke my head in to ask questions and take photos I get a few ideas about what's going on, but looking at the photos reveals even more. The end of the day photos (as opposed to the earlier ones taken during the tub positioning) show that Ken and Jack put in some new studs for the shampoo niches (there's also one for the medicine cabinet on the wall next to where the sink used to be that I didn't get a photo of), that they finished moving the pipe for the sink, that the duct that had the flap in it yesterday has  been taped up, and (I think) that the coax cable went through the wall to the left of the new sink pipe. (I know where it came out: through the vent in the guest room. Poor Ken had to keep running up and down the stairs as he fed cable up from the basement.)
</p>

<p>
I'm getting so that I don't mind the noise so much (though, granted, I only had one phone meeting today, and it was relatively quiet at the time). As Ken assured me today, it'll all be over fairly quickly, which is an exciting prospect. In the meantime, I can honestly say that living upstairs hasn't been too much of a hardship. Both of us kind of like the coziness of the guest room and being on the same floor with both the Beaner and my office. The downside is that when I've forgotten to put on socks or need to fetch my cell phone from my nightstand before going out, I have to climb all the way up to the top floor. We'd almost stay up here if it weren't for the fabulously functional master bathroom that we're going to have in a few short weeks...

<h3 class="title">A Victory For the Red Sox Nation</h3>

<p>
Those of us with cable (as opposed to satellite) will still be able to follow the Red Sox around the country this baseball season, thanks to a last-minute deal between iN Demand and MLB. Thanks also to Senator John Kerry (from Mass., natch) for the "whoa, wait a minute there" when the exclusive deal with DirecTV was announced a few weeks ago.

<h3 class="title">Day 10: Wiring and Wonderboard</h3>

<p>
Day 10 was a long one for Ken; he didn't finish up until about 7:30pm or so. I can't remember how the day started, but by mid-afternoon Jack had e-mailed over a wiring diagram so Ken could figure out where to cut holes for switches and recessed lights. Currently the only lighting in the room comes from a single recessed canister and an early-80s vanity bar. In the new plan, two sconces will poke through the full-wall mirror, and there will be four canister lights around the room, including one over the tub. 
</p>


<p>
We spent a few minutes in a conference call (with me, Al, and Ken crowded around Al's cell phone, set on speaker) making sure we understood where all the lights and switches would go, what kind of switches we'd be getting, how many there'd be, etc., which was educational for all of us, I think. Ken and Jack were able to work out how they wanted to shift one canister that would bump into a joist if placed as diagrammed, and Al and I got to make our switching priorities clear.
</p>

<p>
After the call, things got mysterious again, as I was busy with work and Ken had barricaded himself behind a black plastic curtain in the bathroom. I took pictures of everything I could see that had changed after Ken left last night, but I wasn't able to clarify what the smelly goo on the floor was until this morning. Apparently my sense that the floor was sagging was correct; Ken said that although the subfloor was still sound, there'd been a bit of water damage from one or more tub leaks, causing a gap between the floor and the new tub once the latter was made level. The goo was meant to level the floor and close the gap in preparation for tiling (which is supposed to start on Monday).
</p>

<p>
In addition to the holes in the ceiling and goo on the floor, Ken also put up some water-resistant drywall and some Wonderboard around the tub area (which will be tiled).

<h3 class="title">Day 11: Lights Out</h3>

<p>
I know some of what happened on Day 11 thanks to a couple discussions with Jack (namely, that he roughed-in the plumbing for the tub and shower faucets), but the rest I'll have to guess from photos taken in complete darkness. Seriously, I had no idea what I'd pointed the camera at until I saw the result come up on the screen for two seconds after the flash fired. 
</p>


<p>
The holes in the ceiling are MUCH wider now, for some reason; the lightswitch by the door is gone; and there are wires and extension cords hanging everywhere. During the day yesterday I could hear the sounds of power tools forcing screws into wood until it squeaked, and I could smell the slight burning odor of a soldering iron (or something I can only assume was similar). I think the soldering was for the plumbing, and  all the power-tooling was probably related to the installation of more greenboard (the technical term for the moisture-resistant drywall, my sister tells me; which makes sense, given that it's GREEN). Oh, and I can see that the soap/shampoo niches were cut out.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Day 12: Trouble, Involving Water</h3>

<p>
Day 12 was a short one (for both us and Ken; he left for the day a couple hours before we hit the road for Maryland), but I gather it wasn't a smooth one. I was in a meeting when Ken motioned from the bottom of the stairs that he needed my attention; after I put the phone on mute, I got the news that there was a problem that necessitated turning off the water. I said go ahead.
</p>


<p>
I didn't get any further details about what the problem was when I asked Ken for a summary of the day's work before he left (for this blog entry, obviously :), except that it had to do with the rough-in of the shower controls, and that &quot;it's all straightened out now.&quot; Hopefully that's really the case. I couldn't tell if there was any further electrical work done; some wires seem to be in different spots, and  the new ceiling fan's innards are now clearly visible, but given that the room was completely dark when I took Thursday's photos, it's hard to compare. One thing I could tell right away after looking at the Day 11 photos and then standing in the bathroom while it was still light out after the Day 12 work: the area around the shower controls was Wonderboarded in preparation for Monday's tiling. (I don't know if both the floor and the shower area will be tiled all in one day, but I suspect so.)
</p>

</p>

<p>
Regarding the tile, I have been voting for diagonal placement on the floor and straight/square placing on the wall; Al has been voting for straight/square everywhere. He does not share my concerns about the square arrangement being too uniform or feeling like a yellow brick road leading up the wall, and I do not share his concerns about the diagonal placement not lining up with the baseboard trim. One of us will have to yield, and I think it will likely be me, as the square placement is the more conservative route. That is, I suspect I will be less likely to say, &quot;god, I hate this&quot; than he would be were we to go diagonal. What I fear most is that we'll get the tile in (square), and he'll say, &quot;you know, I think you were right&#8212;it would have looked better diagonal.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Via <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/04/13172.html">Kottke.org</a>: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html">Pearls Before Breakfast</a>, an article about an experiment designed to determine whether anyone would notice if a famous violinist busked at a busy Metro station in Washington, DC. I cried when I got to the part about children being mesmerized by his performance, while their parents tried to hurry them along through the station. Fascinating, heartbreaking, and definitely worth reading.

<h3 class="title">Day 15: No Tile</h3>

<p>
 Nothing happened on Day 13 or 14 (a Saturday and Easter Sunday), and I was starting to think nothing was going to happen on Day 15, either, when Steve arrived  around 3pm. He was looking for Ken, who arrived a few minutes later. Neither of them knew what happened to the tile guys; I suspect I knew more about that then they did, in the sense that Jack had mentioned that the tile guys would be here on Monday &quot;if they don't run over on the job they're doing now.&quot; When the tile guys hadn't shown up by noon, I assumed that they'd run over.
</p>

<p>
Ken and Steve collaborated on getting the new greenboard up on the ceiling, though, so Day 15 wasn't a complete wash. They installed it over the old ceiling, so we lost about 1/2&quot; of room height, but I suspect we won't notice. I'm thinking that Al and I will need to make a run to Lowe's for some more Fern green paint this weekend, if not before, because as soon as the drywall's ready, we'll need to paint. I should ask Jack about that tomorrow: Should we paint before or after the tile goes in? How about the lights? Certainly we should do it before the vanity is installed...

<h3 class="title">Agita</h3>

<p>
I feel like I've been slacking off on the parenthood posts lately. I've abandoned the monthly updates&#8212;which is probably a bad thing, as they help remind me when things happen and how we got where we are now&#8212;and I don't blog most of the funny stuff the Beaner does these days. To assuage this guilt, here's something that happened tonight:
</p>

<p>
I came up to my desk around 7pm to check e-mail and see if there was any inspiration hovering about (it's been escaping me all day), and just then one of my team's managers pinged me to see if I was ready to meet tomorrow about an idea I've been working on. I rather hopefully said, "you don't need visuals, do you?" He responded with "well, that'd be nice." Uh oh. I suck at mockups. My only hope&#8212;and it was a slim one&#8212;was to find some graph paper PRONTO and start sketching out what I thought this thing would look like. WHERE THE HELL WAS MY GRAPH PAPER?
</p>

<p>
Within five minutes I was thoroughly stressed out, and after seven I'd given up the search for graph paper and pulled out a yellow legal pad. I started two drawings, then scratched them out. That's when the Beaner came up for bathtime and completely invaded my office space. He picked up the case for the little USB drive I got at BlogHer and said, "how you open this?" I showed him, and then went back to my legal pad. He closed the case and then said, "can you open it?" I opened it. He closed it again, this time pinching his finger. Oy. "Stop closing it," I said.
</p>

<p>
I returned to scribbling and scratching out. "What is it?" asked the Beaner. "What is it? [pause] What is it? Mommy, WHAT IS IT?" I looked up and saw that he was flailing the open USB case around. "It's a case for a USB... thing."
</p> 

<p>
A few seconds pass, and he asks again, "Mommy, what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"{Beaner}, Mommy needs to get this work done. I love you very much, but I'm stressing out and you're not helping."
</p>

<p>
Al, from the bathroom: "{Beaner}, stop giving Mommy agita."
</p>

<p>
The Beaner responds by knocking over my tea kettle and spilling water all over the floor. I let out a growl of frustration and dash into the bathroom for a washcloth to mop up the spill.
</p>

<p>
"What happened?" Al asks from the shower.
</p>

<p>
I roar again and shout, almost coherently, "HE'S INVADING MY SPACE!"
</p>

<p>
Al: "{Beaner}, come in here and get ready for your shower."
</p>

<p>
I have about 10 minutes of relative quiet, during which a colleague tries to talk me off this mockup ledge I'm on, I try to come to some conclusion regarding the order of operations for the idea, and I read <a href="http://mightygirl.com/2007/04/09/my-labor-story/">Maggie's birth story</a>. The Beaner then pads over, hugs the front of me and the back of my chair, and leans his wet head against my thigh. "I love you, Mommy," he says. "I don't want your agita."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sweetie," I reply, understanding him to mean that he doesn't want to give me agita. "I love you, too." He squeezes me and repeats his anti-agita message a couple more times, then lets go. He's spotted something on the corner of my desk: The plastic maraca he left there a few weeks ago.
</p>

<p>
"<em>There's</em> agita," he says. And with an evil grin, he shakes it.

<h3 class="title">Day 16: Still No Tile</h3>

<p>
 The tile guys were MIA again today, but Steve came in the morning to remove some of the drywall scraps from the bedroom, and Ken came later to tape up the seams on the greenboard. That's pretty much the whole story.

<h3 class="title">The Beaner's First Barbershop Experience</h3>

<p>
 I've been complaining about the Beaner's shaggy mop for a while now; my last attempt to cut it just made him look like a cross between Keith Richards and an early Beatle, and it didn't do much to get rid of most of the bulk. 
Several times I threatened to whip out my Wahl clippers if Al didn't take him to a proper barber, and over the weekend I actually got the box of clippers (I have two) and attachments out. Luckily, Al managed to hold me back, and he made an appointment with his barber for both of them last night.
</p>


<p class="pictureP">

<br />
Evidence of crazy mop.<br />

</p>

<p>
I brought the Beaner (and my camera, of course) to Maxamillion's Gentlemans Quarters on Chestnut Street between 20th and 21st at 6pm to find Al already in the chair. Within five minutes, Al was finished, and Steve had the little kid attachment propped onto the barber chair. He hoisted the Beaner up, and then the fun began. I really do mean fun; the Beaner really seemed to enjoy the experience, and Steve gave him a *great* haircut. The Beaner actually giggled at one point and said, &quot;Daddy, look at me!&quot;
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157600063510397/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/251/454808483_fa2e9acb79.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="&quot;daddy, look at me!&quot;" /></a>
</p>

<p>
The folks at Maxamillion's (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/454777914/in/photostream/">Maxamillion himself</a> and Steve, especially) were extremely forebearing when it came to my near-constant camera-clicking. I was almost always underfoot or blocking the door or practically sitting in the receptionist's lap (I got a great shot of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/454777942/in/photostream/">her super-cool shoes</a>, tho, so it was worth it), but Steve just smiled, shook his head, and said, &quot;Mothers.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Though the Quarters in question at Maxamillion's are a bit tight for a photographer, there's plenty of room for the grooming services (plus two cool chairs up front to sit in while you wait). Al really likes the haircuts he gets from Steve, too, and would recommend him highly. If you happen to stop in for a haircut, tell them Al Cho sent you. After two referrals, he gets a free haircut. :)

<h3 class="title">Freak Accident-Prone</h3>

<p>
Many people can claim to be accident prone. I am FREAK accident-prone. I am sometimes reluctant to describe how I got the various bruises, scratches, and other visible injuries to my body because they either sound so stupid as to be embarrassing, or because no one would believe me if I told them. It's not so much the actual injury-causing thing, most times, that's the unbelievable part. It's the HOW of the story that's nutty.
</p>


<p>
 With that introduction, you should not be surprised when I tell you that a cactus fell on me this morning while I was attempting to put on my shoes. Hours later, I am still digging bits of cactus spine out of my hands&#8212;and worse, from around my fingernails. Cactus spines are funny things: when you pull them out, even if you do so gingerly, often a little piece of broken spine remains behind. Sometimes you can't even see these little pieces, but you can *feel* them if you run a finger over the spot... and of course, they hurt like hell. 
</p>

<p>
The good news was that the damage to my hand was worth it. The Beaner happened to be standing next to me at the time, and when I realized the cactus was coming down on us, I used that hand to shield his face. Better 10-15 cactus spines in my hand than in his tender cheeks. I am worried, tho, that Al's shoes are filled with invisible spines, and that he'll be stuck the next time he slips on his tan suede loafers; the Beaner's black NBs were struck by the falling cactus and had to be tossed because I'm sure for every visible spine, there are five more that I can't see.

<h3 class="title">Credit Where Taxes Are Due</h3>

<p>
Can I just say how much I HATE the fact that Al is considered the Taxpayer, and I am considered the Taxpayer's Spouse, when it is <strong>I</strong> who prepare our taxes every year? I am constantly misreading instructions in TurboTax and every other tax-related form I receive (hello, I'm talking to YOU, City of Philadelphia School Income Tax Form) because I mistake the <em>you</em> in "Do <strong>you</strong> or your spouse..." for me. "<strong>Your</strong> income" is not MY income, but his income. "Your spouse's income" is my income.
</p>

<p>
It's ridiculous. TurboTax, at the very least, should ask who is running the application. For the plain old paper forms, I'm on my own: I have to check to see if the form has Al's name on it, and if so, sign under Spouse instead of Taxpayer. Aren't taxes difficult enough without adding this extra complexity?
</p>

<h3 class="title">Photo Glut</h3>

<p>
I had this idea that I haven't been taking many photos lately, but I'm realizing as I page through iPhoto that the opposite is true. While I haven't been able to get out and Photograph, in an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157594284320074/">about town II</a> kind of way, I've been taking <em>gazillions</em> of photos of individual events over the past couple weeks&#8212;like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/exhibitiongame">the exhibition game between the Red Sox and the Phillies</a> that we went to on March 31st, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/easter">Easter at my parents' house</a>, a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?d=taken-20070331-20070402&w=51822599%40N00&q=nyc&m=tags">day trip to NYC</a> to see Al's brother's family, and of course our bathroom remodel.
</p>

<p>
For everything except the bathroom remodel, I'm discovering that I've uploaded one or two photos and then run out of time to review, edit, and upload the rest. I'm trying to catch up now, so there might be a ton of photos flooding my Flickr stream... or I might discover that there really were only two or three good photos of each event after all. In which case, you can ignore this post (and my stream).

<h3 class="title">Day 17: The Tiling Begins...Kinda</h3>

<p>
Steve the tile guy (as opposed to Steve the Bearded, who I believe works directly for Jack rather than as a subcontractor) came today. I consulted him and Jack about the advisability of placing the floor tile diagonally, after Al agreed to consider it if I'd be willing to Freecycle the black four-drawer filing cabinet that he loathes. (This was a no-brainer for me; most of the files that are still in that cabinet could go into storage boxes without me really missing them, since they're not files I need to access more than once a year, if that.) Steve had an opinion as to the <em>feasibility</em> (no problem), but he was agnostic about the advisability.
</p>


<p>
This is where having one person who does the design &amp; build &amp; install is really key. We talk about Jack as &quot;our contractor,&quot; but he's really much more than that. He came up with the design for the bathroom (based on the things we told him we hated about the current one and what we'd like to see in a remodeled version), he's doing the cabinetry work, and he's obviously on-site at least a couple times a week to do some of the work. He's always offered good design advice when we didn't have a clue which way to go, and he's willing to explain the pros and cons of various options.
</p>
<p>
Jack opined that based on the size of our bathroom (small) and the size of our tile (rather large, at 13&quot;), he'd recommend diagonal. He was able to articulate exactly my concern: namely, that in such a small space, lots of straight, square lines could actually make the room look crooked&#8212;even if they were dead on. We even got Steve off the &quot;I can do it any way you want&quot; fence for a brief moment, long enough for him to opine that it's best to tile the floor diagonally, &quot;especially when the wall uses the same tile laid straight.&quot; <em>Exactly.</em> Rather than keep things hypothetical, however, Jack whipped out a few tiles and checked the measurements. We quickly determined that laying the tile diagonally would also work better technically, since there'd be more whole tiles on the main axes.
</p>
<p>
After all that, though, Steve announced that I still had until tomorrow to decide, since he was going to start with the tub tile. And he did... but about an hour after getting all his equipment wedged into the bathroom and his radio set up right outside, he discovered that the blade on his tile saw needed to be replaced. Instead of cutting out nice little openings for the shower bits, it just snapped the tile in two. Consequently, we have some tile adhesive on the wall, but only four tiles. The rest will go in tomorrow... and maybe some of the floor will, too? I'm not sure.

<h3 class="title">Keep Up With Congress</h3>

<p>
My friend <a href="http://johnolilly.typepad.com/blog/">John</a>, via his blog, turned me on to <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/">Open Congress</a>, a new web site that follows the goings on in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. I'm finding their <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/articles/atom">Congress Gossip Blog</a> (link goes to RSS feed) to be a fabulously useful way to keep up with the issues being debated, and the political machinations involved, without having to read a gazillion political blogs (and mentally adjust for their various leanings) every day. If you have an RSS reader, add the Gossip Blog feed, scan for a couple weeks, and see if you don't feel more informed&#8212;more connected to the process of running this country&#8212;than you were before.

<h3 class="title">The Axes of Environmental Impact</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/04/13179.html">kottke.org</a> has an interesting link today to <a href="http://www.ilea.org/lcas/hocking1994.html">a life-cycle energy analysis of reusable and disposable cups</a>. Considering the much more energy-intensive process required to create the reusable cups, and the energy impact of washing them, it turns out that you'd have to use a ceramic mug more than one thousand times before it became a more energy-efficient choice than a styrofoam cup&#8212;and that's assuming a highly energy-efficient dishwasher.
</p>

<p>
I question the conclusion, however, that "[t]he lesson of this life-cycle energy analysis is that the choice between reusable and disposable cups doesn't matter much in its overall environmental impact." Doesn't this study just illuminate the <em>energy </em>impact of the various kinds of cups? What about the environmental impact of having to dispose of all those paper and styrofoam cups? Does the toxicity of the dishwasher soap somehow also outweigh the space required in landfills?
</p> 

<p>
I have no idea, but I do wonder.

<h3 class="title">The After-Effects of a Tank Girl Haircut</h3>

<p>
I am coveting <a href="http://www.sweetboots.com/newrock/high/600.html">these boots</a>. I have visions of transforming my wardrobe into something <a href="http://galadarling.com/static/about-gala">Gala</a> would wear, because honestly? That's what I feel like inside. It's only on the outside that I'm a Gap Tall-and-blue jeans-wearing 38 year-old. What if the inside were to manifest itself on the outside? It sorta already does, in my hair, but lately I've been considering a more drastic leap.
</p>

<p>
Would the Beaner still recognize me as Mom? Would Al still want to hold my hand in public? And, most importantly, would the boots cause blisters?
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I'm so punk.

That sound you just heard, if you live in the vicinity of 21st and Cherry Streets in Philadelphia, was an asshole honking at me to get out of the crosswalk so he could floor it across 21st Street. <em>Out of the way, &lt;sneer&gt;pedestrian&lt;/sneer&gt;, I need to get on with the business of scaring the wits out of all the parents of young children who live on this block of Cherry Street!</em>

<h3 class="title">Smelly</h3>

<p>
It's been a VERY long day, and though I am slightly more coherent now that I've eaten some Paneer Tikka Masala and rice out of separate cartons (with a spork!) and had a shower, I am minutes away from crashing on the hopefully-comfortable hotel bed.
</p>

<p>
Before I do, can I just rant for a moment about how the stupid liquid-and-gel rules are forcing me to waste time hunting for soap and shampoo I'm not allergic to whenever I get where I'm going? At least in Boston I was only allergic to half of the hotel toiletries; as long as I stuck with the shampoo and bath soap and avoided the hand soap and lotion, I was fine. Here at the Hilton in San Francisco, I'm allergic to every single one of the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products. Luckily, I was able to find a travel size mint and rosemary shampoo at the nearby Walgreen's that, while much more strongly scented than I would prefer, at least didn't give me a migraine or a sneezing fit.
</p>

<p>
I'm wondering: How does the quart-size plastic bag rule stop terrorists? Banning the stuff seemed extreme and reactionary, but the bag thing just seems stupid... I mean, none of the stuff is being tested, so it could be anything. Why not just let travelers take as much as they want? OK, definitely not coherent enough to argue about this right now. Going to bed.

<h3 class="title">A Little Color</h3>

<p>
Oy, it's been a busy week here in San Francisco. I thought I'd packed the USB cable for the camera so I could upload photos as I went, but alas I did not. Might be in the suitcase I'd planned to bring but then switched out when I realized my final item didn't fit. Anyway, that's just my way of saying "the post about what I've been doing this week will come later, when there are photos to go with it."
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I wanted to mention that I didn't sleep particularly well last night, what with the ferocious leg cramps (wtf? did I drink NO water yesterday? hmmm). It felt like I never got into a deep sleep... and yet, I just remembered that I dreamed that I dyed my hair pink. It was a weird dream, in that I could feel myself lying in that hotel bed, not really sleeping, and the next thing I knew I was throwing back the covers, marching to the bathroom, and combing pink and purple dyes through my hair.
</p>

<p>
I think I only remembered this dream because I noticed this morning that my hair was decidedly *not* pink, and it seemed odd. Perhaps I will have to get out the dye when I get home and go to town.

<h3 class="title">Winsha is Short, Lori is Tall</h3>

<p>
OK, obviously I'm behind on blogging&#8212;after a week running around San Francisco meeting friends and former work colleagues for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and meeting current work colleagues for, well, <em>meetings</em>, I have a gazillion photos to upload and a few stories to tell. I also have the day off, but I chose to get a massage this morning to help mitigate the after-effects of Friday's migraine, vacuum the remodeling dust off every surface in the house, get caught up on laundry, file my expenses, deposit some checks that arrived while I was gone, upload some of the gazillion photos, sync my personal Outlook, work Outlook, and kitchen paper calendars with Al's hockey and my travel schedules, and have a beer rather than blog... until right now. Yes, with about 15 minutes until the Beaner and his sharecare nanny come through the door, I've decided to tell one of my SF stories.
</p>

<p>
On Thursday I had lunch with my friend and former colleague Winsha (she's now on the Flex Builder team, while I stayed on the Dreamweaver team). After lunch we stopped at the new-to-me Starbucks at Townsend &amp; 8th, where Winsha ordered a short latte and I ordered a decaf double-tall latte.
</p>

<p>
The friendly woman behind the counter said, "can I have your names?" with Sharpie poised. I replied, "Winsha&#8212;W-I-N-S-H-A&#8212;is short, Lori is tall." And then Winsha and I totally cracked up. I proposed that we take a photo of ourselves and then the finished drinks, so everyone else could get the joke too. My self-portrait mojo was totally missing on this day, sadly, so this is the best I could do:
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

Winsha is short, Lori is tall
</p>

<p>
The missing self-portrait mojo wasn't the worst of it, though. It turns out that the lovely woman behind the counter stomped on the punch line by reversing the drinks. (Geez, that was the point: that the mnemonic was so EASY!) Oh well.
</p>

all evidence to the contrary, Winsha is short, Lori is tall

<h3 class="title">Day 18: Real Progress on the Tile</h3>

<p>
I took a couple photos while Steve was working on Day 18, but when I went down at the end of the day to see what he'd gotten done, I found my way blocked by blue painter's tape. It looked like he'd finished setting the tile for the tub/shower, but I wasn't sure until the morning of Day 19, when I snuck in to get a couple more photos while Steve was out back getting some supplies out of his truck. He definitely finished the tub/shower&#8212;everything except the niches, that is&#8212;on Day 18, and he got about half the floor laid. Woot!

<h3 class="title">Michael Pollan on the Farm Bill: Don't Be Fooled Again</h3>

<p>
Please, please go read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/magazine/22wwlnlede.t.html?ex=1335067200&en=56d0833dcf38897c&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">You Are What You Grow</a> in the New York Times Magazine. Some of its contents will be familiar to anyone who's read the absorbing, eye-opening <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omnivores-Dilemma-Natural-History-Meals/dp/1594200823/sr=8-1/qid=1171040122?ie=UTF8&s=books">The Omnivore's Dilemma</a>, but it's more specifically about the farm bill&#8212;which Pollan argues should be called the food bill instead. An excerpt:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If the quintennial antidrama of the “farm bill debate” holds true to form this year, a handful of farm-state legislators will thrash out the mind-numbing details behind closed doors, with virtually nobody else, either in Congress or in the media, paying much attention. Why? Because most of us assume that, true to its name, the farm bill is about “farming,” an increasingly quaint activity that involves no one we know and in which few of us think we have a stake.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Au contraire, my friends who eat. Au contraire.

<h3 class="title">Day 19: The Niches Go In</h3>

<p>
Day 19 was all about getting more of the floor tiles laid, and the soap/shampoo niches finished. That's about all there is for news&#8212;not sure what took me so long to write such a boring post. :) To pad it a little, I will sneak in something the Beaner just said to me, after the photo.

<p id="theBearIsAHer">
The Beaner: &quot;Mommy, will you help me with my teddy bear?&quot;
</p>
<p >
Me: &quot;Sure, buddy, what do you need?&quot;
</p>
<p >
The Beaner: &quot;Can you open her hockey clothes?&quot;
</p>
<p >
Me: &quot;You want me to take her [it's a her?] hockey outfit off?&quot;
</p>
<p >
The Beaner: &quot;Yes, please.&quot;
</p>
<p >
We go through the process of removing the hockey outfit and putting on the golf outfit, and then the Beaner reaches for the bear and gives it a giant hug.
</p>
<p >
The Beaner: &quot;I love my teddy bear! I love her SO MUCH!&quot;
</p>
<p >
And he gives a little twirl to emphasize his point.

<h3 class="title">Days 22-26: Finished Tile</h3>

<p>
I was away in San Francisco for Days 22 through 26, and when I returned, the tile was fully laid and grouted. I'm not sure what happened on which day (it might have all happened on day 22 or 23, for all I know); what I do know is that I was thrilled to see it finished. I'm also really glad we went with a diagonal layout on the floor. I think it looks nice&#8212;interesting without being busy&#8212;and something about the pattern makes me very happy.

<h3 class="title">Day 29: Duct Mystery Solved</h3>

<p>
 The weather was beautiful in Philadelphia this weekend. I seriously considered that Philadelphia might be trying to woo me back after a delightful week in San Francisco (remember that when I left, it was SNOWING). In any case, one drawback of the warm, sunny weather is that the upstairs of our house&#8212;where I work and we're all sleeping during the remodel&#8212;got unbearably hot. It's normally hotter than the rest of the house, especially in the middle of summer, but it seemed decidedly odd that it should be quite <em>this</em> hot when it was only 80 degrees outside.
</p>


<p>
After one uncomfortable night&#8212;and after observing that the downstairs was downright <em>cold</em>&#8212;Al went around closing all the downstairs vents and making sure that the upstairs ones were open. The second night, it became obvious that *no air* was coming out of the upstairs vents at all. We set up two fans and suffered through, but it was pretty awful&#8212;especially when the Beaner got into bed with us in the wee hours of the morning. (Yes, we are total 21st-century, first-world wimps. We like our heat in the winter and A/C in the summer.)
</p>
<p>
Jack had e-mailed a progress invoice for the tile work on Saturday, so on Sunday I responded that I'd have a check ready for him on Monday, and on a related note, was it possible that in the process of snaking the cable through the ductwork that we might have broken something? Jack said he'd check with Ken, and then look into it himself when he came on Monday to get the check.
</p>
<p>
That brings us to Day 29. Jack came and checked the ductwork, which looked sound, and also removed the register through which we'd snaked the cable to see if he could spot any trouble there. Nothing. He went downstairs, came back up, looked again, and said, &quot;it's working now.&quot; It turned out that it was a dirty furnace filter. Definitely a forehead-smacking situation; I'd thought about checking the filter, of course&#8212;and the thermostat I'd been experimenting with said right on it &quot;change filter monthly for best perfomance&quot;, as if to reinforce the idea&#8212;but I'd dismissed the thought because I'd changed the filter only three weeks ago. What I hadn't taken into consideration is that it would become clogged faster during the remodel because of all the construction dust. Normally I use my allergies as a guide for when to change it; if I start sneezing while doing the laundry, it's time. (Our dryer is not vented to the outside, and it's in the same room as the heat pump&#8212;or whatever the HVAC unit is called&#8212;so the filter usually gets clogged with lint after about 4-5 weeks.) In this case my allergies were not a good guide, because [a] it's allergy season outside, and [b] I'm behind on the laundry. That is, I've been sneezing, but not in the laundry room.
</p>
<p>
Not that it matters, but in case you're curious, we use Ultra-Allergen filters from 3M. They're expensive, but they do seem to trap all the crap that would otherwise be circulating through the house (and to which I *am* allergic). I do wonder, however, whether the cost and trouble of getting the dryer vented to the outside would be offset by being able to buy slightly cheaper filters (i.e., maybe the red ones instead of the purple). Hm... maybe I should get Jack to give me a cost estimate?
</p>

<h3 class="title">Days 30 &amp; 31: Final Drywall Touches</h3>

<p>
At least, I think these are the final drywall touches. I combined Days 30 and 31 because I have only 1 and 2 photos from each, respectively, and because essentially the same thing happened on both days: Ken came and worked on the last bits of drywall in preparation for painting and setting the cabinetry.
</p>


<p class="pictureP" >
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/474062858/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/202/474062858_93fd7645eb_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="the new drywall covering the sink plumbing" /></a>

</p>
<p >
Jack mentioned when he was here on Monday that the cabinetry was ready; they were just waiting for the drywall to be completed before they brought it over to be set in/positioned/installed/whatever it's called when cabinetry goes in. I asked if we should paint before the cabinetry arrived, and he said that if Ken could finish the drywall in the next couple days, we could paint this weekend. 
</p>
<p >
This is how 
Al and I happened to be at Lowe's tonight with the bathroom/bedroom paint chip I'd saved from when I painted both rooms in December of 2003... as well as a sample of the granite we liked, a square of floor tile, and a sample of cherry wood <em>just in case</em>. (Al had mentioned over the phone when I was in San Francisco that he was now thinking that perhaps we should paint the bathroom a different color than the bedroom.) With only a limited amount of time to look, however, and 80 gazillion paint chips in front of us, I almost gave up before we started&#8212;especially when Al said that the color he was thinking about was the one his dad's condo had recently been painted: namely, beige. I immediately had visions of the icky tan color of the old sink (also the old wall color, before I painted it green), and blanched visibly. 
</p>
<p >
I tried to be game, though, and pulled out a couple samples&#8212;one that I hated as soon as Al held it up to the tile, and one that he declared &quot;too cool&quot;. I briefly considered gray before grabbing a card with three shades of green on it, each of which went well with our existing green chip without matching it exactly. I voted for the lightest shade, while Al liked the medium color. The medium was still lighter than our existing chip and looked quite nice with the tile, wood, and granite, so it was immediately approved by both of us. We got the paint guy started on mixing us a gallon of the stuff in a satin finish, went to pick out some primer and grab a couple more furnace filters, and we were done. 
</p>
<p >
I'm looking forward to seeing the color on the walls this weekend!
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Beaner and the Bear</h3>

<p>
 I mentioned in one of my bathroom progress updates yesterday that the Beaner has a teddy bear, and that he thinks of it as a her. My sister and my niece got the bear for the Beaner for his first birthday, but he didn't show much interest in it until his second. Anyway, it's a Build-A-Bear, so naturally my sister and my niece got a couple outfits for it (that's the whole point of Build-A-Bears&#8212;the clothing and accessories that go with them), both nods to Al's and my hobbies, hockey and golf.
</p>

<p>
This morning when I was getting myself and the Beaner dressed, he asked if the bear was in her jammies, too. I said no, that she didn't have any jammies, so she was still wearing her golf outfit (and, strangely, the ice skates from the hockey outfit). &quot;Why doesn't she have any jammies?&quot; the Beaner asked. &quot;Um, because Aunt Lisa and M. didn't get her any. But I think we could probably get her some at the store.&quot;
</p>
<p>
The Beaner immediately lit up. &quot;Can we get her some at the store RIGHT NOW?&quot; I said no, it was only 7:30 in the morning, and the store wasn't open yet. But next time we went to the store, I promised, we'd buy her some jammies. Now, normally I'm kind of a hard-ass when it comes to the gift-giving and the treats and all that, but I was really taken with the ideas that (a) he thought of the bear as a her, (b) he had declared his undying love for her, and (c) he thought she needed jammies. I decided that I would run some errands in the car before starting work, and that I'd do my best to get his bear some jammies while I was out.
</p>
<p>
I left the house at 8:40am and did some banking, then continued on to the Target, where I'd wanted to go last night after Lowe's. I was kind of mad when Al vetoed the idea (ostensibly because it was too late, but I think more because he wanted to go to the Target in New Jersey, where he could get Mexican food, on another night), but actually it turned out swell, because I pretty much had Target all to myself at 9am on a Friday morning. I got all the stuff I'd come for, plus two Cars t-shirts and a pair of Nemo swim trunks (on sale for $1.98!!) for the Beaner, and then headed across the street to the Cherry Hill Mall.
</p>
<p>
I timed it pretty perfectly; I had a chance to pee and get a coffee at Starbucks, and by the time I'd taken my first sip of decaf double-tall latte, they were raising the gate on the Gymboree store. (Oh, right, I forgot to mention: I also needed jammies for *the Beaner*, as he's down to only two pairs that fit.) I found a cute short-sleeved shirt/bermuda-length shorts pair on sale in size 4T, paid for them, and then headed next door to the Build-A-Bear Workshop... where I was appalled to find that the only girl bear pajamas looked like something off a Bratz doll. The boy pajamas sucked too: my only choices were a Superman set and a Spiderman set. (The Beaner doesn't know who Superman is, but I'm pretty sure he'd think those jammies would look weird on his bear, and he's declared Spiderman to be &quot;a little scary.&quot;)
</p>
<p>
After hunting around for a while, I finally settled on a plain white t-shirt (I thought of it as a babydoll-type girl shirt, but it might have been unisex&#8212;which, as far as I'm concerned, would be a good thing) for $4. As I took it up to the counter, I suddenly had an idea. &quot;If you were going to put real baby clothes on a bear,&quot; I asked the woman there, &quot;what size would you get?&quot; She replied that she had no idea, &quot;but whatever you get, it'd have to be small. Sometimes people come in and buy the bear outfits for preemies.&quot; I paid for the shirt and then went back over to Gymboree.
</p>
<p>
I found the 0-3 months section of the sale rack, and scanned for preemie clothes. I found about five or six options, all in muted shades of pink, yellow, and orange. The problem was that even on sale, most of the items were more expensive than the bear outfits. I finally hit on a winner, though: a pair of romper pants for $8. Wooo! Now the Beaner's bear could have a pair of pajamas that looked roughly like his own, instead of like a Vegas hooker's.
</p>
<p>
When I got home with all my loot, the Beaner gasped, &quot;LIGHTNING McQUEEN!&quot; when he saw the t-shirts... and then he looked at me with a puzzled sort of love, like &quot;you did that for <em>me</em>?&quot; when I showed him the bear's new jammies. That's when I knew I'd succeeded as a mom.
</p>

&quot;I love her so much! She's my beeeest friend.&quot;
</p>

<p>
<em>Postscript: </em>After the Beaner got out of the shower and he and Al were sitting on our bed with the bear, Al called out to me, "These jammies are really cute... but you know, I had <em>no idea</em> until now that this bear was a girl!" I replied, "Honey, COME OUT HERE THIS INSTANT," and a whispered conversation ensued out of earshot of the too-eager-to-repeat-every-word-we-say Beaner, in which Al was apprised of <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2007/04/day_19_the_niches_go_in.html#theBearIsAHer">the recent "her" designation</a>.
</p>

<p>
I have to say, after the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/474899789/">Dora backpack debacle</a>, I am thrilled for the Beaner to have a gender-neutral toy that he can play with however he likes, not how we too-eager-to-assign-gender-roles adults say he should.

<h3 class="title">The Real Estate Reality Check</h3>

<p>
About once or twice a year, something will happen that makes Al and me consider moving back to San Francisco. Maybe not seriously, but enough to check the housing prices and to start having theoretical discussions about what would be lost and what would be gained by moving.
</p>

<p>
I usually start the housing price check by looking at condos in San Francisco and houses in Palo Alto, but Al's method for determining the true state of affairs is more foolproof: Just check the listings in our old neighborhood in Mountain View for a <a href="http://johnfyten.com/eichler_city.htm">Mackay</a> with the same floor plan as ours. We used to live in the Monta Loma section of Mountain View, which had a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Eichler">Eichlers</a> and many, many more Mackays. There were only a few different floor plans, so it's usually easy to find one just like ours on the market.
</p>

<p>
I don't want to live in Moutain View again (it's lovely, but it's a bit too far south for me, and there wasn't much to walk to in our hood), so I never think to do a search there. After doing several Palo Alto, San Carlos, Burlingame, San Mateo, and Redwood City searches last night, Al said, "just go to Moutain View and find a Mackay". I did, and sure enough, there was a listing on a street one over from our old one. Same floor plan, but not nice as ours had been, IMHO... and listed for $250,000 more than we sold our house for in September, 2003. Yes, you read that right: The house was *not* listed for $250,000, but for <em>a quarter of a million dollars <strong>MORE </strong></em>than we sold our house for less than four years ago.
</p>

<p>
It really did tell us all we need to know about the cost of moving back.

<h3 class="title">A Plea for Permalinks</h3>

<p>
Nothing is more frustrating than being behind in your blog reading and coming across a reference to a New York Times article that sounds REALLY INTERESTING... only to find that when you click on the link, you can only see the first 40 words or so of the piece. This need not be! The New York Times provides a permalink to each article so that it will remain available to blog readers even after the article has gone "into the archives".
</p>

<p>
To use this option, RESIST THE URGE to copy the URL in the Address bar of your browser, and instead click on the + sign next to SHARE in the little box of options floating at the top right of the article. An additional list of options for sharing will appear; choose PERMALINK. When you do this, a new window will open with the URL you need to copy. (I'm not sure if you have to allow pop-ups to make this work, but you might.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Easy as pie&#8212;and it'll make your blog posts relevant for weeks and months to come.
