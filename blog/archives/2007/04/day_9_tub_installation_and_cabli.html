<h3 class="title">Day 9: Tub Installation and Cabling</h3>

<p>
Jack's son Rylan and Rylan's friend (or just associate? I'm not sure, but he was nice) Jeremy showed up around 9:30 this morning. When I saw the two of them at the door, I knew that they were the reinforcements necessary to move the tub upstairs. Jack and Ken came a few minutes later, and together the four of them shimmied and tugged and hauled and wedged the tub up to the living room, then up to the master bedroom, and then into the master bath. Rylan and Jeremy departed once the tub was in place, and Jack and Ken did the final work to seat it.

After the tub went in there was lots of sawing and drilling and other loud noises, as well as a consultation with Jack about where the coax cable should come up into the guest bedroom. I find that when I poke my head in to ask questions and take photos I get a few ideas about what's going on, but looking at the photos reveals even more. The end of the day photos (as opposed to the earlier ones taken during the tub positioning) show that Ken and Jack put in some new studs for the shampoo niches (there's also one for the medicine cabinet on the wall next to where the sink used to be that I didn't get a photo of), that they finished moving the pipe for the sink, that the duct that had the flap in it yesterday has  been taped up, and (I think) that the coax cable went through the wall to the left of the new sink pipe. (I know where it came out: through the vent in the guest room. Poor Ken had to keep running up and down the stairs as he fed cable up from the basement.)
</p>

<p>
I'm getting so that I don't mind the noise so much (though, granted, I only had one phone meeting today, and it was relatively quiet at the time). As Ken assured me today, it'll all be over fairly quickly, which is an exciting prospect. In the meantime, I can honestly say that living upstairs hasn't been too much of a hardship. Both of us kind of like the coziness of the guest room and being on the same floor with both the Beaner and my office. The downside is that when I've forgotten to put on socks or need to fetch my cell phone from my nightstand before going out, I have to climb all the way up to the top floor. We'd almost stay up here if it weren't for the fabulously functional master bathroom that we're going to have in a few short weeks...
