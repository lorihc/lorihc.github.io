<h3 class="title">Day 15: No Tile</h3>

<p>
Nothing happened on Day 13 or 14 (a Saturday and Easter Sunday), and I was starting to think nothing was going to happen on Day 15, either, when Steve arrived  around 3pm. He was looking for Ken, who arrived a few minutes later. Neither of them knew what happened to the tile guys; I suspect I knew more about that then they did, in the sense that Jack had mentioned that the tile guys would be here on Monday &quot;if they don't run over on the job they're doing now.&quot; When the tile guys hadn't shown up by noon, I assumed that they'd run over.

<p>
Ken and Steve collaborated on getting the new greenboard up on the ceiling, though, so Day 15 wasn't a complete wash. They installed it over the old ceiling, so we lost about 1/2&quot; of room height, but I suspect we won't notice. I'm thinking that Al and I will need to make a run to Lowe's for some more Fern green paint this weekend, if not before, because as soon as the drywall's ready, we'll need to paint. I should ask Jack about that tomorrow: Should we paint before or after the tile goes in? How about the lights? Certainly we should do it before the vanity is installed...
