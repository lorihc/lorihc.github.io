<h3 class="title">Only Children Can Hear It</h3>

<p>
Via <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/04/13172.html">Kottke.org</a>: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html">Pearls Before Breakfast</a>, an article about an experiment designed to determine whether anyone would notice if a famous violinist busked at a busy Metro station in Washington, DC. I cried when I got to the part about children being mesmerized by his performance, while their parents tried to hurry them along through the station. Fascinating, heartbreaking, and definitely worth reading.

<p>Wow! What a terrific article. I can't believe that so few people stopped. I don't know what I would have done myself. I loved watching the street musicians in Chicago. There was an elderly Asian man who used to play the violin with a girl I assumed was his granddaughter. I would stop and watch them. But I was never in that much of a hurry, I guess. I never want to be in that much of a hurry either.</p>

<p>Kids are just the smartest, aren't they? To appreciate that while their parents rush, rush, rush...</p>

<p>ABC's nightly news featured that story.  They even had fast-forward video of the station.  The children really were the only ones who even looked Joshua Bell's way.</p>

<p>Personally, I always give money to the really good street musicians.  I want to encourage them to play where I can hear them!  The bad ones, not so much.  Them I'd pay to go away!  Like the recorder lady at 18th and Walnut.  Ugh.</p>

<p>Yup, this was fantastic. I also like that Joshua Bell admitted that it transformed him: Whereas he's used to having the rapt attention of full houses, he was shaken up a bit at playing to a disinterested crowd. I liked how he said "$40 an hour. I could live on that, and I wouldn't have to pay an agent."</p>

<p>The bluesy guitar guy at the 8th St. Station is pretty good. I hope I would have stopped for Bell.</p>
