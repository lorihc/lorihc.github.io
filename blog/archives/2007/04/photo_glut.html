<h3 class="title">Photo Glut</h3>

<p>
I had this idea that I haven't been taking many photos lately, but I'm realizing as I page through iPhoto that the opposite is true. While I haven't been able to get out and Photograph, in an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157594284320074/">about town II</a> kind of way, I've been taking <em>gazillions</em> of photos of individual events over the past couple weeks&#8212;like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/exhibitiongame">the exhibition game between the Red Sox and the Phillies</a> that we went to on March 31st, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/easter">Easter at my parents' house</a>, a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?d=taken-20070331-20070402&w=51822599%40N00&q=nyc&m=tags">day trip to NYC</a> to see Al's brother's family, and of course our bathroom remodel.
</p>
<p>
For everything except the bathroom remodel, I'm discovering that I've uploaded one or two photos and then run out of time to review, edit, and upload the rest. I'm trying to catch up now, so there might be a ton of photos flooding my Flickr stream... or I might discover that there really were only two or three good photos of each event after all. In which case, you can ignore this post (and my stream).
