<h3 class="title">A Little Color</h3>

<p>
Oy, it's been a busy week here in San Francisco. I thought I'd packed the USB cable for the camera so I could upload photos as I went, but alas I did not. Might be in the suitcase I'd planned to bring but then switched out when I realized my final item didn't fit. Anyway, that's just my way of saying "the post about what I've been doing this week will come later, when there are photos to go with it."
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, I wanted to mention that I didn't sleep particularly well last night, what with the ferocious leg cramps (wtf? did I drink NO water yesterday? hmmm). It felt like I never got into a deep sleep... and yet, I just remembered that I dreamed that I dyed my hair pink. It was a weird dream, in that I could feel myself lying in that hotel bed, not really sleeping, and the next thing I knew I was throwing back the covers, marching to the bathroom, and combing pink and purple dyes through my hair.
</p>

<p>
I think I only remembered this dream because I noticed this morning that my hair was decidedly *not* pink, and it seemed odd. Perhaps I will have to get out the dye when I get home and go to town.

<p>Aren't dreams fun?</p>

<p>Leg cramps, though, I could do without.</p>

<p>I'm sleep-deprived as wel, but not due to leg pain. Only a three-year-old who went on vacation and dissed the majority of his naps. :)</p>
