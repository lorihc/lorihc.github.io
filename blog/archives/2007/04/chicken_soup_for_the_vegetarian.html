<h3 class="title">Chicken Soup for the Vegetarian</h3>

<p>
Tonight I did something I haven't done in almost 20 years. Well, two things. First: I made chicken soup (for Al, who was wishing yesterday that he had some to help him fight off a cold). Second: I ate some.
</p>
<p>
I stopped eating red meat in the fall of 1987, when I was a sophmore in college. I continued to eat poultry for almost a year after that, but then it got so chicken and turkey tasted like meat, too. I almost got to the point where I gave up seafood as well, but I had a chat with my tastebuds and my psyche wherein I explained to them that I had grown up on seafood (in New England), that it was an easy way to get enough protein, and that I planned to have my (non-bacon-infused) chowder and broiled scallops and fried Haddock as long as they were available to me. (I hadn't started eating sushi yet&#8212;I didn't discover that until the early 90s&#8212;but I'm glad we had that talk before sushi and I were introduced.)
</p>

<p>
Aside from a small nibble of ham and one of chicken while I was pregnant to see if they appealed (they didn't), I haven't knowingly eaten any non-seafood meat since 1988, if memory serves. Until tonight. Without thinking too hard about it, I decided to taste the chicken after I removed it from the soup pot. It was actually quite good! I'd used an organic, had-access-to-the-great-outdoors-but-never-actually-went-outdoors chicken from Trader Joes, and I'd simmered it with some onions, carrots, celery, fresh parsely, and a bit of dried rosemary and thyme. I didn't add any salt because I hadn't planned on tasting it to check the salt levels; I figured I'd leave that to Al.
</p>

<p>
So anyway, the chicken tasted very mild, and not at all like the over-processed, over-salted mechanized death that I'd come to expect chicken to taste like, based on the smell I associate with KFC and some of the rotisserie chickens all brings home. So I ate a bit more. In all, I probably ate about six small shreds of meat, plus a small bowl of broth and vegetables over egg noodles. (The broth did need salt, but honestly, the chicken itself tasted much better without any.)
</p>

<p>
My stomach feels a tad sour now, but other than that I seem to be processing this foreign food OK. Whether I'll eat any more tomorrow (or ever again) remains to be seen, but I don't regret eating what I did tonight. (Although I couldn't seem to get the phrase, "<a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/490/Meat_is_Murder_Tasty_Tasty_Murder">meat is murder. tasty, tasty murder</a>" out of my head the whole time I was chewing.)

<p>Being a vegetarian by birth, practice, habits etc. from the sub-continent, I wonder what will happen if every human on earth turns vegetarian?</p>

<p>I wonder about that, too. One of the reasons I became a vegetarian was that I became convinced, at the time, that we weren't meant to eat land animals. (The other was that I didn't care for the taste of meat, and I realized that now that I was cooking and buying my own meals, I didn't have to eat it!)</p>

<p>These days I'm not convinced that humans are meant to be vegetarian. I think it's the right thing for some humans, just as eating meat is the right thing for others. I do think we've gotten a bit far removed from the food we eat -- whether it's meat or tofu -- and I'm not sure that's a good thing for anyone.</p>

<p>It's certainly an interesting thought experiment to try to imagine what an earth full of vegetarians would look like. At the very least, a lot of farming and ranching incentives would change!</p>

<p>We were seafood + vegetarians for a while, but we're migrating a bit away from seafood and toward raised-responsibly poultry because of the alarming mercury levels and unsustainable harvesting in the former. (In addition to my pregnancy cravings.) Problem is, we don't know how to cook it! Your soup sounds delicious.</p>

<p>I think about food issues pretty frequently: meat vs. non, preservatives, chemical flavors, etc. </p>

<p>Your comment about being "far removed from the food we eat" really resonates with me, too. I don't think I would feel comfortable eating certain things after seeing the preparation that went into it (including the injuries of the underpaid workers.)</p>

<p>I have a chicken-and-turkey-loving Husband who adores red meat but it causes him GI distress, so he avoids it most of the time. (We use turkey for homemade tacos and what-not)</p>

<p>And I used to love a pink steak, but now it tastes "off" to me. And I never did like white meat.</p>

<p>I love seafood though. I could exist on sushi alone, I am convinced! Bagels and lox, lefse with smoked salmon, Thai spicy tofu, Indian yellow curried shrimp, and well-prepared taro root would also make me pretty happy.</p>
