<h3 class="title">The After-Effects of a Tank Girl Haircut</h3>

<p>
I am coveting <a href="http://www.sweetboots.com/newrock/high/600.html">these boots</a>. I have visions of transforming my wardrobe into something <a href="http://galadarling.com/static/about-gala">Gala</a> would wear, because honestly? That's what I feel like inside. It's only on the outside that I'm a Gap Tall-and-blue jeans-wearing 38 year-old. What if the inside were to manifest itself on the outside? It sorta already does, in my hair, but lately I've been considering a more drastic leap.

<p>
Would the Beaner still recognize me as Mom? Would Al still want to hold my hand in public? And, most importantly, would the boots cause blisters?
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I'm so punk.

<p>Oooooooooh!  You're so cute.  New Rocks are actually really comfortable, the most comfortable boots/shoes I've ever owned.  They're also incredibly hardy, I've had one pair for about 11 years now & they are totally fine.  Your hair is amazing (I assume that's you in the side-bar?) & hey... I'm listening to Will Smith.  Punk is a state of mind ;></p>

<p>A true Tank Girl would never ask or need the opinions of others about her wardrobe! She would make her fashion statement with a defiant attitude and total disregard of criticism. At least that's my take on the matter.  Do you wonder what direction the Beaner will go, fashion wise, when he's about 14 or 15?</p>

<p>Oh, I'm not worried about criticism. :) I suspect, also, that if the Beaner recognizes me with dark purple, pink, or white hair, that boots won't make a difference.</p>

<p>As for his fashion choices, he has pretty strong ideas about what he wants to wear now, and I imagine those ideas will only get stronger as he gets older!</p>
