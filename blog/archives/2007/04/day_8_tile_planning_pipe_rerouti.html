<h3 class="title">Day 8: Tile Planning, Pipe Re-Routing, and Tub Delivery</h3>

<p>
Nothing happened on Day 7 (a Sunday), so I skipped it, but today there was a flurry of activity in the bathroom. Jack consulted me about how I wanted the tiles to be laid (I'm leaning toward diagonal on the floor and straight on the wall, but Al thinks straight for both would be better), and where the soap and shampoo niches should go in the shower; Ken worked on making the two left and right sink hookups into one center one; a hole was drilled in the Wonderboard to accommodate the tub drain; and Ken opened a flap in the duct work so he and Jack could see if threading some coax through it to wire the guest room for cable would be feasible.

The big (and I mean that literally) news for the day: the new tub was delivered. It stayed where it was dropped off, however&#8212;in our entrance hall&#8212;because it was too heavy for Jack and Ken to move by themselves.
