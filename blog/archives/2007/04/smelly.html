<h3 class="title">Smelly</h3>

<p>
It's been a VERY long day, and though I am slightly more coherent now that I've eaten some Paneer Tikka Masala and rice out of separate cartons (with a spork!) and had a shower, I am minutes away from crashing on the hopefully-comfortable hotel bed.
</p>
<p>
Before I do, can I just rant for a moment about how the stupid liquid-and-gel rules are forcing me to waste time hunting for soap and shampoo I'm not allergic to whenever I get where I'm going? At least in Boston I was only allergic to half of the hotel toiletries; as long as I stuck with the shampoo and bath soap and avoided the hand soap and lotion, I was fine. Here at the Hilton in San Francisco, I'm allergic to every single one of the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products. Luckily, I was able to find a travel size mint and rosemary shampoo at the nearby Walgreen's that, while much more strongly scented than I would prefer, at least didn't give me a migraine or a sneezing fit.
</p>

<p>
I'm wondering: How does the quart-size plastic bag rule stop terrorists? Banning the stuff seemed extreme and reactionary, but the bag thing just seems stupid... I mean, none of the stuff is being tested, so it could be anything. Why not just let travelers take as much as they want? OK, definitely not coherent enough to argue about this right now. Going to bed.

<p>You CAN take whatever you want.  You just can't carry it on.</p>

<p>The time you will save in drugstores will cover the time you spend waiting at baggage claim.</p>
