<h3 class="title">The Beaner's First Barbershop Experience</h3>

<p>
 I've been complaining about the Beaner's shaggy mop for a while now; my last attempt to cut it just made him look like a cross between Keith Richards and an early Beatle, and it didn't do much to get rid of most of the bulk. 
Several times I threatened to whip out my Wahl clippers if Al didn't take him to a proper barber, and over the weekend I actually got the box of clippers (I have two) and attachments out. Luckily, Al managed to hold me back, and he made an appointment with his barber for both of them last night.
</p>

Evidence of crazy mop.<br />

</p>

<p>
I brought the Beaner (and my camera, of course) to Maxamillion's Gentlemans Quarters on Chestnut Street between 20th and 21st at 6pm to find Al already in the chair. Within five minutes, Al was finished, and Steve had the little kid attachment propped onto the barber chair. He hoisted the Beaner up, and then the fun began. I really do mean fun; the Beaner really seemed to enjoy the experience, and Steve gave him a *great* haircut. The Beaner actually giggled at one point and said, &quot;Daddy, look at me!&quot;
</p>

</p>

<p>
The folks at Maxamillion's (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/454777914/in/photostream/">Maxamillion himself</a> and Steve, especially) were extremely forebearing when it came to my near-constant camera-clicking. I was almost always underfoot or blocking the door or practically sitting in the receptionist's lap (I got a great shot of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/454777942/in/photostream/">her super-cool shoes</a>, tho, so it was worth it), but Steve just smiled, shook his head, and said, &quot;Mothers.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Though the Quarters in question at Maxamillion's are a bit tight for a photographer, there's plenty of room for the grooming services (plus two cool chairs up front to sit in while you wait). Al really likes the haircuts he gets from Steve, too, and would recommend him highly. If you happen to stop in for a haircut, tell them Al Cho sent you. After two referrals, he gets a free haircut. :)

<p>I walk by Maxamillion's all the time and always look in to admire all the cool old barbershop paraphernalia they have.  It looks like a barbershop should.    </p>
