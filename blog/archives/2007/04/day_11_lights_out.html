<h3 class="title">Day 11: Lights Out</h3>

<p>
I know some of what happened on Day 11 thanks to a couple discussions with Jack (namely, that he roughed-in the plumbing for the tub and shower faucets), but the rest I'll have to guess from photos taken in complete darkness. Seriously, I had no idea what I'd pointed the camera at until I saw the result come up on the screen for two seconds after the flash fired. 
</p>

<p>
The holes in the ceiling are MUCH wider now, for some reason; the lightswitch by the door is gone; and there are wires and extension cords hanging everywhere. During the day yesterday I could hear the sounds of power tools forcing screws into wood until it squeaked, and I could smell the slight burning odor of a soldering iron (or something I can only assume was similar). I think the soldering was for the plumbing, and  all the power-tooling was probably related to the installation of more greenboard (the technical term for the moisture-resistant drywall, my sister tells me; which makes sense, given that it's GREEN). Oh, and I can see that the soap/shampoo niches were cut out.

The significantly larger ceiling holes, <em>now with wires!</em><br />
