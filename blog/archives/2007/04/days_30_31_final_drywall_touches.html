<h3 class="title">Days 30 &amp; 31: Final Drywall Touches</h3>

<p>
At least, I think these are the final drywall touches. I combined Days 30 and 31 because I have only 1 and 2 photos from each, respectively, and because essentially the same thing happened on both days: Ken came and worked on the last bits of drywall in preparation for painting and setting the cabinetry.
</p>

Jack mentioned when he was here on Monday that the cabinetry was ready; they were just waiting for the drywall to be completed before they brought it over to be set in/positioned/installed/whatever it's called when cabinetry goes in. I asked if we should paint before the cabinetry arrived, and he said that if Ken could finish the drywall in the next couple days, we could paint this weekend. 
</p>
<p >
This is how 
Al and I happened to be at Lowe's tonight with the bathroom/bedroom paint chip I'd saved from when I painted both rooms in December of 2003... as well as a sample of the granite we liked, a square of floor tile, and a sample of cherry wood <em>just in case</em>. (Al had mentioned over the phone when I was in San Francisco that he was now thinking that perhaps we should paint the bathroom a different color than the bedroom.) With only a limited amount of time to look, however, and 80 gazillion paint chips in front of us, I almost gave up before we started&#8212;especially when Al said that the color he was thinking about was the one his dad's condo had recently been painted: namely, beige. I immediately had visions of the icky tan color of the old sink (also the old wall color, before I painted it green), and blanched visibly. 
</p>
<p >
I tried to be game, though, and pulled out a couple samples&#8212;one that I hated as soon as Al held it up to the tile, and one that he declared &quot;too cool&quot;. I briefly considered gray before grabbing a card with three shades of green on it, each of which went well with our existing green chip without matching it exactly. I voted for the lightest shade, while Al liked the medium color. The medium was still lighter than our existing chip and looked quite nice with the tile, wood, and granite, so it was immediately approved by both of us. We got the paint guy started on mixing us a gallon of the stuff in a satin finish, went to pick out some primer and grab a couple more furnace filters, and we were done. 
</p>
<p >
I'm looking forward to seeing the color on the walls this weekend!
