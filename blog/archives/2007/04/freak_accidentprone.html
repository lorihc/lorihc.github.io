<h3 class="title">Freak Accident-Prone</h3>

<p>
Many people can claim to be accident prone. I am FREAK accident-prone. I am sometimes reluctant to describe how I got the various bruises, scratches, and other visible injuries to my body because they either sound so stupid as to be embarrassing, or because no one would believe me if I told them. It's not so much the actual injury-causing thing, most times, that's the unbelievable part. It's the HOW of the story that's nutty.
</p>

<p>
 With that introduction, you should not be surprised when I tell you that a cactus fell on me this morning while I was attempting to put on my shoes. Hours later, I am still digging bits of cactus spine out of my hands&#8212;and worse, from around my fingernails. Cactus spines are funny things: when you pull them out, even if you do so gingerly, often a little piece of broken spine remains behind. Sometimes you can't even see these little pieces, but you can *feel* them if you run a finger over the spot... and of course, they hurt like hell. 
</p>

<p>
The good news was that the damage to my hand was worth it. The Beaner happened to be standing next to me at the time, and when I realized the cactus was coming down on us, I used that hand to shield his face. Better 10-15 cactus spines in my hand than in his tender cheeks. I am worried, tho, that Al's shoes are filled with invisible spines, and that he'll be stuck the next time he slips on his tan suede loafers; the Beaner's black NBs were struck by the falling cactus and had to be tossed because I'm sure for every visible spine, there are five more that I can't see.
