Gah, I thought it was just a fluke that I couldn't connect to my site via FTP for the past three days from my Mac, but it wasn't. I discovered that I can't connect to it from anywhere. My ISP is looking into the problem now.

To top off a bad night technically, I was trying to figure out why the squid video wasn't showing up, and I went to look at a hockey blog entry to see what I'd done *right* over there. Whole hockey site is 404. WTF? The pages are all there; looks like maybe somebody over at the ISP cut off my lori-and-al domain, maybe?
