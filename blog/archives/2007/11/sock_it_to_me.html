<h3 class="title">Sock It To Me!</h3>

<p>
I've got a lot of things I want to write about on the parenting front, but I've been sitting on them because I'm not sure I want to share publicly. It's a funny thing how sometimes you'd rather share with random strangers than with those closest to you; in those cases, since many close friends and family members read my blog regularly, I usually choose to keep the posts to myself. I either write them in a paper journal, or I post them in a private blog just for me and Al, as I did when I was pregnant.
</p>
<p>
I've been going the paper route since the Beaner was born, but I'm thinking it might be time to start another private blog. Whether I do or not, I need to get it all out for both posterity and sanity, and *then* decide whether I want to share. While I'm on this subject, a big thank you to anyone reading: Y'all have been really good about not trying to offer advice via e-mail or other posts when I turn off comments. Thanks for understanding my need to spew into the void sometimes.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, what I'd intended to post about tonight was SOCKS! I've been posting photos of my shoes (more specifically, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157603193058650/">my Dansko clogs</a>) in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/nobloshoemo/">NaBloShoeMo</a> pool for the past 26 days, and lately I've also been showing off my socks... mainly because I was induced to buy a new pair of Dansko mary janes* by the NaBloShoeMo craziness, and mary janes just CRY OUT for creative sockage.
</p>

Either my Danskos have become boring, or my socks have become interesting, because lately most of the comments on my shoe photos have been about the socks. This morning <a href="http://www.bipolarlawyercook.blogspot.com/">BipolarLawyerCook</a> suggested that I start a sock pool for December, and I immediately searched Flickr's groups to see if there was a group called Sock It To Me. 
</p>

<p>
Well, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/554752@N24/">there is now</a>!
</p>

<p>
If you're not totally sick of blogging/photographing your shoes every day and have some interesting socks to share, come post in the pool starting on December 1. You don't have to post a sock photo every day; just post when you're wearing a pair that you wish more people could see.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* I consider myself conservative on this front; I suspect many more women bought many more pairs of shoes after seeing all the cute offerings in the pool.

<p>Wow - I'm impressed that you are starting a Flickr group. I hardly have time to post photos to Flickr let alone start a group. That said, now I need to get some interesting socks so I can post a photo to the group next month :) </p>
