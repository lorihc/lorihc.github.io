<h3 class="title">Mushroom Stroganoff From Memory</h3>

<p>
I just got a craving for something warm, creamy, and savory for lunch, so I decided to make the mushroom stroganoff I used to make when I was in high school and college. The problem is that I haven't made it in about 15 years, and I couldn't remember the recipe. Also, I only had a single can of mushrooms, no fresh ones. (I *am* handicapped, aren't I?)
</p>
<p>
The one thing I remembered was that it tasted good over Minute Rice, which I also don't stock. I substituted Trader Joe's brown rice (in the stand-up package), and found it to be too hard. Next time I'll go with the traditional noodles. Anyway, here's what I did:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Melt about 1 T. butter in dutch oven or large saucepan</li>
<li>Dump in about 1/2 a bag Wegman's chopped onions (mine were in the freezer)</li>
<li>Saute onions while opening small can mushrooms (large can, two small cans, or a container of fresh mushrooms would have been better</li>
<li>Dump mushrooms in with onions and continue to saute</li>
<li>Open can of reduced-fat condensed mushroom soup (regular would have been fine, too) and dump into onions and mushrooms; stir to combine</li>
<li>Dump in 1/2 a bag of Trader Joe's vegetarian meatballs (I wish now I'd left these out, but in the absence of more mushrooms, they acted as filler)</li>
<li>Cook until meatballs are heated through, then reduce heat to Lo</li>
<li>Throw in about 8oz. sour cream and stir thoroughly</li>
<li>Decide mixture should be soupier, consult Joy of Cooking, dump in some Pinot Grigio from a box (or whatever white wine you have on hand</li>
<li>Stir and heat through</li>
<li>Serve</li>
<li>Decide the mixture is still too thick, go back downstairs and saute some more onions in a bit of butter until browned</li>
<li>Deglaze with about 1/2 cup more white wine, and let some of the alcohol boil off</li>
<li>Dump wine and onions into stroganoff and stir</li>
</ol>

<p>
Much better. Note to self: Buy more mushrooms.
