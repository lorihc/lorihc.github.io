<h3 class="title">iPhone Time Zones</h3>

<p>
I am LOVING my iPhone. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. Don't know how I ever lived without it. I am, however, having one teensy little frustration (OK, a couple, but this is the one that's giving me fits at the moment): I can't seem to sync my Outlook calendar properly to my iPhone when meetings (or rather, one particular recurring meeting) are scheduled in another time zone.
</p>
<p>
I have a meeting that's scheduled every Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at 11am Pacific time (2pm Eastern). After syncing with my iPhone, Outlook seems to think that the meeting is scheduled at 2pm Pacific time, and blocks out the 5pm-6pm hour on my calendar. Meanwhile, the iPhone is hunky-dorey and reports the meeting correctly at 2pm. If, however, I move all the meeting blocks from 5pm-6pm to 2pm-3pm on my Outlook calendar (manually, because I don't control the meeting invite and thus can't change recurrence without screwing up the exceptions to the invite), they end up at 11am on my iPhone. Arg!
</p>

<p>
I'd rather have the times right on my Outlook calendar, if I had to choose, because that's the calendar everyone else on my team sees and schedules around. However, what I most want is to have the iPhone and Outlook tell me THE SAME THING.
</p>

<p>
Since it's only this meeting that's screwed up, I might just erase the original invite and put my own meeting reminder in manually. But in the meantime, does anyone reading this know what happened, and how to fix it? Besides setting my Time Zone support to "on" on the iPhone, what else should I be doing? (Or is that wrong to begin with?)
