<h3 class="title">Busy, Busy</h3>

<p>I'm starting to find my footing again at work, but at the same time I find myself wishing I could have more time off. Running the household, I found in 2003-2004, is a full- time (or nearly full-time) gig. Why I think I can do it competently while also taking on more responsibility at work, I'll probably never understand, but that's my expectation.</p>
<p>I was going to make a long list of the things I would do if I had the next week or three off from work, but one bullet point in I realized that (a) it's too hard to write HTML blog posts on an iPhone, and (b) I'll have to do the first 8 or 9 things on the list before Friday, work or no. The things that will fall off the list are catching up with e-mail and written correspondence, shopping for the perfect birthday gift for my sister, reading, and sleeping. Probably some writing/photography/blogging/web projects, too. All the other stuff, from sending out invitations for--and then planning--the Beaner's third birthday party to paying bills and filing expense reports, must get done. Oh, and so must the work I actually get paid to do.</p>

<p>I've got to figure out what I can drop or delegate while still feeling like I'm accomplishing something professionally, being a good parent, and expressing myself creatively. Just your everyday Mom dilemma, I know. How clich&eacute;d.</p>

<p>You can drop the "shopping for the perfect b-day gift for my sister" off the list.  No need.  Just knowing you remember is plenty.  Hope things settle down/out/in (whichever is appropriate)for you soon.  </p>

<p>Yeah, we can have it all.  Just not all at the same time, and not ALL of it all.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>
