Yeah, so NaBloPoMo is pretty much over for me. I'll keep writing when I can&#8212;and for all I know, that might be every day for the rest of this month and into December&#8212;but it's just not my first priority these days. Keeping myself above water emotionally, writing my version of my annual review (yep, it's even *more* fun this year, when I feel like a total failure&#8212;woo!), giving feedback on no less than five colleagues, fixing bugs, paying bills, writing new code, keeping track of five engineers to make sure they're happy and on track, managing two hockey schedules, a Thanksgiving commitment, a soon to be three year-old's birthday party, my first parent-teacher conference, and... oh crap, open enrollment for our benefits.
</p>
<p>
Didn't I already write this post, you ask? Yeah, I think I did. Sorry about that. Hopefully whatever I write next will be totally original.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and though I'm behind in posting my photos to the <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/nobloshoemo/pool/">NaBloShoeMo pool</a>, I *have* been taking pictures of my Danskos every day. I'm also catching up on my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157600238740199/">My Every Day</a> photos in spurts because sometimes the photo I want to use for that day is on a roll of film, and I only get those developed every 3 or 4 days. So I do have a creative outlet, and of course I have hockey (though I haven't been writing about that, either, I *have* been posting some videos to vimeo). I guess it's more about the photos and videos than the words these days.

<p>I totally hear you! NaBloPoMo is quite a commitment, on top of everything else a working mom has on her plate. Plus it sounds like you have a couple other fun projects for this month as well. Hang in there, the middle part is the hardest (I think, not having been through this before myself), and before you know it, you will be to Thanksgiving, which is surely ripe for discussion (dysfunctional families and all)....:-)</p>

<p>Long time reader, first time commenter. Shame you're gonna be slowing down, your sites are a staple in my time killing arsenal. But yah, sounds like you have quite the packed schedule, kinda makes me think I should cut down on my time killing arsenal.</p>
