<h3 class="title">Redesigning</h3>

<p>
I realized this morning that all the (non-work) projects on my list involve re-designing/re-configuring. Apparently I am in need of change. I want to rearrange my office, get a new chair, and get an L for my current desk so I have actual space for all my computers. Currently my MacBook is up on a pantry rack, both to keep it cool and so that I have space for two mice underneath; my personal laptop is on the too-high-for-a-seated-person project table; and my chair, which was bought for my old drafting table-style desk, is too high. My shoulders are always aching from hunching over. 
</p>
<p>
We've been giving some thought to moving my office into the guest room, getting rid of the queen-sized bed in there in favor of a sleeper sofa, and returning my current space to its original sitting area status or leaving the project table here and using it as the craft area. I'd like that, since I lost my combo craft area/office when the Beaner came along. The trick will be Internet access; currently there's none in the guest room. There's a line running up from the cable modem in the basement in the Beaner's room (again, because it used to be my office), as well as a second cable modem hooked up to the cable line in there. We could move the second cable modem to the guest room and run all my connections through there, but we'd have to do some thinking about how everything is split.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the frame for the Beaner's new bed arrived yesterday, and we've been thinking about how we want to rejigger his room to accommodate it. I didn't bother to get the dimensions of the bed or measure the room before I ordered it, so we're now wondering if the slide's going to work at all. Al has suggested moving everything out, Trading Spaces-style, and then reassembling the room around the bed. We might have to do that.
</p>

<p>
We also need to make some adjustments to the storage in the living room, and we're considering moving one of the Expedits down there and getting rid of the white dresser, which was supposed to be an interim solution (one I never liked). The living room and the entry hall both need fresh paint and photos or art on the walls. Oh, and speaking of painting, we still need to touch up a bunch of spots in the bathroom. I really want to get that finished and cleaned so I can take photos of it to show y'all.
</p>

<p>
Last, but not least, I want to redesign my websites. Both the avocado8 and the hockey blogs have gone a long time with their current designs (avocado8 has gotten some tweaks over the past couple years, but I realized yesterday that the hockey blog's last redesign was October 2005). This is obviously rather low priority, as they're working fine the way they are, and I haven't even been updating the hockey blog as much as I'd like to anyway.
</p>

<p>
I think the bottom line is: I'm in need of a little Autumn Cleaning, and I need to take 2-3 weeks off work to do it. Hrmmm. There's got to be a way to get this all done before summer.

<p>That sounds like heaven - taking two or three weeks off just to sort out the house.</p>

<p>You should absolutely reassemble the Beaner's room around the bed.  Because the bed is so cool, it deserves that.</p>

<p>If you're anything like me when it comes to projects like that, it'll take ya five years! :)</p>

<p>I sympathize with the office situation. I moved mine to accommodate Devin's arrival, but only because I needed a cable modem. He got the short end of the stick, though. His room is smaller. At least he's too young to realize that!</p>

<p>Have you thought about moving the Beaner into the current guest room - you know design a whole new room around the bed?  That way, you could continue to leave him in his current room while taking your time getting his new room ready.  Then, when you are done, you would have the room with the internet access back for a work room.  Just a thought.  You would also be able to hear if the Beaner gets up at night because his room would be above yours.</p>
