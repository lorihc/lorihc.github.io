<h3 class="title">Ow, WTF?</h3>

<p>
So I've been packing on the poundage lately, most likely because (a) I've been depressed, (b) I've been sedentary (well, I *did* start walking daily in August and playing hockey in September, but before that my injured ankle made me less active than usual), and (c) I can't seem to get the pregnancy and nursing nutrition guidelines, wherein fat = good, out of my brain. I haven't been nursing the Beaner since December, 2005, and yet I'm still eating like I am.
</p>
<p>
When I got up to what for me is a rather alarming number a couple weeks ago, I decided to start counting Points again. (I use the old Weight Watchers point system from the early 90s, before the fiber modifications, because it's worked for me before.) I'd been doing great; maybe not feeling thinner or noticing the change so much in my clothes, but I did feel like I'd at least reversed the upward trend.
</p>

<p>
This morning, however&#8212;despite having neither gained or lost any weight for two days&#8212;I suddenly can't simultaneously breathe, sit, and wear pants. One of these things has to go. Picture baking a double recipe of cake batter in a single 9" pan, and you have an idea what my stomach looks like spilling over my jeans. It's not only ugly, it HURTS! Ow! What the f&^% has happened?
</p>

<p>
And why does this painful scenario make me want to eat more rather than less?
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Update: </strong> I removed my jeans and put on stretchy, too-big yoga pants. It was an emergency, y'all!</em>
