<h3 class="title">All This Time, He's Had a Polaroid</h3>

<p>
Al swears up and down that he told me this a long time ago, but I don't remember it: He has a Polaroid. All this time it's been sitting in a dusty bin somewhere in the basement. All this time!
</p>
<p>
It's out now, mainly because the weekend before Thanksgiving we were talking about games to play at the Beaner's third birthday party, and I mentioned that Martha Stewart had this sweet idea for a "pin the face on the jack 'o lantern" game that involved taking Polaroid photos of each kid's attempt. I lamented that the Beaner's birthday fell after jack 'o lantern season, and that we did not have a Polaroid camera. "My sister has one, though," I said. "Maybe I could borrow it?"
</p>

<p>
"I have a Polaroid," said Al.
</p>

<p>
If he's right that he told me this before&#8212;more than once!&#8212;then I must be as bad at listening as he is sometimes. In any case, minutes later he'd dug it out for me, and I was on eBay looking for cheap 600 film. (That shit's EXPENSIVE when you're paying retail.) The 4-pack I got for a bit of a discount on eBay arrived today, and of course I had to test it before I could leave proper feedback for the seller.

<p>
Expect more like this to pop up in my Flickr stream from time to time. Meanwhile, Al is starting to worry about my camera and film habit...
