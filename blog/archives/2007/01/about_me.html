I spent TWO HOURS today trying to write a short bio for myself. I'm still not finished. Why, oh why can I not adequately describe my current position, experience, and expertise in three or four brief sentences?

... because you're an interesting and complicated person?</p>

<p>... because writing is hard?</p>

<p>... because writing about yourself is *really* hard, and the dreaded 'short bio' is the worst of all?</p>

<p>I'm just guessing here.</p>

<p>OK, after spending another hour on it after the Beaner went to bed last night, I finally came through with this:</p>

<p>Lori Hylan-Cho is a software engineer on the Dreamweaver team, specializing in JavaScript extensibility. Prior to joining the Dreamweaver team in 1997 for the first release of the product, she was a webmaster at Mecklermedia and a web producer at Macromedia, and throughout her career she's written and spoken about web development, JavaScript, the DOM, and Dreamweaver extensibility. Lately Lori has been tracking down CSS browser bugs for Adobe's CSS Advisor website and for an upcoming Dreamweaver feature. When not writing code, fixing bugs, or investigating CSS issues, Lori can be found with either a camera or a hockey stick in her hand (and sometimes both at once). She's an avid photographer, ice hockey winger, blogger, and mom.</p>

<p>Now that I've typed that out a second time, I'd add to Dave's list "... because writing about yourself *in the third person* is just plain weird."</p>
