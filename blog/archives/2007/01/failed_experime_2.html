<h3 class="title">Failed Experiment #63</h3>

<p>
On Friday last week I was home with The Beaner, so I decided to try a day without diapers. He loved wearing underpants, and he peed every time I took him to the toilet... but he didn't quite get that he was not supposed to pee in his pants, too. After the second pair of underpants (and outer pants) got wet, he whimpered a little in discouragement. After the third pair got wet, he said, "I need a diaper." Ever since, we've been sticking with diapers&#8212;but doing our best to keep them dry with regular visits to the bathroom. He's been a total champ, and I'm hoping that the next time we try this, it won't be a <em>failed</em> experiment, but a successful one.
