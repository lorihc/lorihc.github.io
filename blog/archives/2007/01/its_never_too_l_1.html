<h3 class="title">It's Never Too Late for Resolutions</h3>

<p>
Or at least, that's what I'm telling myself: That just because I've waited until January 4 to make any resolutions at all doesn't make them invalid. Not allowing myself a resolution would sort of be like eating the whole bag of cookies because what the hell? you've already eaten four of them!, only the opposite... or something.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, is it absolutely crazy of me to resolve to post every day? I feel the same nervousness I did when I signed up for NaBloPoMo, so something tells me that this is indeed crazy, but also the right thing to do. Writing every day was a good thing for me in November; why wouldn't it be in January, February, March, etc.? I might not catch up with all I want to say with this resolution, but at least I will have *some* record of my life in 2007.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of having a record of my life, I've been uploading a gazillion photos taken over the holiday break to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/">Flickr</a>, with more to come. (Actually, I think I started uploading the ones from New Year's weekend before I finished uploading the Christmas ones, so my photostream will be slightly out of order.) I realized when we were in NYC over the weekend how LONG it's been since I've gone on a photo walk, and how much I've been jonesing for one. I tried to get a few snaps of the city while also documenting The Beaner's adventures with his cousin, aunt, and uncle, and the little I got only made the ache to go on a photo walk stronger.
</p>

<p>
I can't remember if I mentioned that the two-month period of bliss where The Beaner never woke up before 7:20am has ended; sometime in November we went to an erratic schedule of him waking anywhere between 5:45am and 8:45am (and usually on the earlier end of the scale). It's made getting up for a walk in the morning nigh impossible, but I'm thinking that I'm going to have to come up with a solution to that problem. I NEED my morning walks, dammit, and I think they could be a way to assuage some of the photography jones, too. If I could stay out for an hour, I could get a walk *and* some photos in at least once a week.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, here are a few of my favorites from the NYC photos I've uploaded so far:

<p>
And oh! Before I forget: I got one of my most-desired items on my Amazon wishlist from Al for Christmas&#8212;namely, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCanon-Speedlite-580EX-Digital-Cameras%2Fdp%2FB0002XQWCK%2Fsr%3D8-2%2Fqid%3D1167943905%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Delectronics&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Canon Speedlite 580EX Flash</a>. I didn't use it for any of the NYC photos (too big to carry around when traveling with kids), but I tried it out on Christmas morning, and I'm going to try to practice more with it this week.

<p>It is never too late for resolutions!</p>

<p>After building up a good head of steam with NaBloPoMo, I posted every day in December except for Christmas Eve.  Not sure what happened there.  But I forgave myself, and am back on the posting horse.</p>

<p>Which maybe is a hobby horse, of sorts.</p>

<p>That boy of yours is just darling.  He's really a wonderful combination of the two of you.  It's so cool.</p>
