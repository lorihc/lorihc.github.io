<p>
So guess what? Yesterday <a href="http://www.schmutzie.com/2007/09/809-rockin-girl-blogger-award.html">Schmutzie</a> commented to say that she'd given me an award: The Rockin' Girl Blogger Award. I think it makes me sound a bit like a 22 year-old punk rocker banging out the angst on my keyboard&#8212;in other words, hipper than I actually am. If it weren't for the hair, I wouldn't have much credibility on the hip front.
</p>
<p>
And speaking of my hair, the award kind of matches it:

</p>

<p>
Anyway, now it's my turn to pass on the love. I know some rockin' women bloggers out there who are wicked hip (or just wicked wacky, which in my book earns bonus points). Please go check out:
</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~vbg/blog/">Valerie</a>. It says right in her tagline that she's not glamorous or hip, but I suspect that's only because she doesn't have time. She teaches computer programming, violin, and Tango; plays in a band called Tango Mucha Labia; dances regularly; makes her own jam and pickles; chops wood; maintains her car and her house; studies permaculture.... and I know I'm forgetting a few things. She's an inspiration to me daily.</li>
<li>If you hadn't heard, Mainely Madge is back, and she's <a href="http://madgetastic.typepad.com/">Madgetastic!</a></li>
<li>Here's a twofer: The amazingly creative <a href="http://www.summerpierre.com/blog.html">Summer Pierre</a> turned me on to <a href="http://www.mackvilleroad.blogspot.com/">a college friend who homeschools in Vermont</a>. Their lives are so different from mine, and so interesting.</li>
</ol>

<p>
OK, I can think of tons more, actually, but I promised myself I'd log off the computer at 10pm, and it's now 10:08. No time for updating my blogroll with the actual blogs I've been reading via RSS feed lately; that will have to wait until tomorrow, at which point you'll be able to see many more lovely ladies whom I've been reading regularly. Rock it, chiquitas!

<p>Your link to me is a link to you.  But quite aside from nitpicking, thanks for passing it on.  I'm going to go and check them out.</p>

<p>Oops, sorry -- it's actually an empty link. I left the &lt;a href=""&gt; in there as I was writing, planning to paste in the URL when I was finished, and I forgot. Apparently my site treats empty links as links to "self". It's fixed now! Thanks for letting me know, and of course for the award. :)</p>
