<h3 class="title">My Body Is Trying to Tell Me Something</h3>

<p>
I've got the blurry vision that precedes a migraine right now, which means that half the screen is obscured. Please forgive any typos; I'm trusting my touch-typing skills, which seem to be getting worse the longer I work on computers.
</p>
<p>
When I realized this migraine was coming, roughly 15 minutes ago&#8212;after applying some bleach to my roots, I came over to the Mac to check the time so I'd know when to wash the stuff out, and had to squint to read the numbers&#8212;I couldn't help but laugh. Of <em>course</em> I have a migraine coming. It makes sense. Last night while out shopping with the Beaner, I suddenly felt absolutely terrible while standing in the middle of DiBruno Bros. I felt sluggish and weird and desperately in need of sleep.
</p>

<p>
At that very moment, the Beaner finally hit one what he wanted for dinner: avocado rolls. So I called Al for Tampopo's number, told him I felt terrible, and then <s>called</s> slurred in my order. On the walk from 18th Street to 21st Street, I actually <em>dozed off</em>. Thank god I had hold of the stroller handle, which I used to regain my balance when I started to stumble. I've dozed off while driving before, but never while walking.
</p>

<p>
The Beaner asked on the way home if he could see what was in the bag. I said, "spicy pork and avocado rolls." He then asked what I was going to eat. Clever kid, to realize that the pork was for Daddy, and the rolls were for him&#8212;or maybe that I'd only read off two items. In any case, I told him that Mommy wasn't feeling well, and didn't want to eat. "But you have to eat!" he said. "You'll feel better."
</p>

<p>
Al was home by the time we arrived back, so I handed him dinner and announced that I'd be sending my boss two updates and then going to bed. At this point, in addition to feeling exhausted and slow, I was also feeling nauseous.
</p>

<p>
The timing was such that the Beaner was done in the bathtub at the same time I finished my updates. He asked to watch Blues Clues, and we explained to him that because Mommy wasn't feeling well, his options were these: 1. Watch Blues Clues and have Daddy put him to bed, or 2. Go to bed now and have Mommy snuggle him. After protesting that he wanted Blues Clues *and* Mommy a couple times, he opted for #2.
</p>

<p>
As we climbed into his bed, he said, "I wish I could feel you better." I told him how sweet that was, and how much I would love it if he *could* make my tummy ache go away. "I'll snuggle your neck, and that will make your tummy feel better," he said. What ended up making me feel best of all is that he conked out at 8:50, and I was able to crawl into my own bed. I was out as soon as the 15 minute sleep timer on my Alexander Hamilton audiobook went off, and I slept for 10 hours.
</p>

<p>
I woke up with a headache, but I took some Tylenol and went for my morning walk anyway. Which brings us up to date: I came back, put the bleach in my hair, aaaaaaaannnd.... migraine. Why, hello, body. Do you have a message for me?
