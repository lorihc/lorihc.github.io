<h3 class="title">The Purple Squishy Car in the Moleskine</h3>

<p>
On Monday morning, before leaving Lancaster (yeah, I know, I never announced that we'd be spending Labor Day weekend in Lancaster, PA, but <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/lancastercounty/">the evidence that we did is on Flickr</a>), I requested to be dropped off at the Borders Outlet for a while. I was still in a "need soothing" mode, and a wander around a bookstore with my Favorite Early Music playlist seemed like just the ticket. It wasn't, really; outlets aren't the same as real bookstores because the selection is random, and the shelving more so, but I tried to make the best of it and not let the chaos get to me.
</p>

<p>
The good news was that when I approached the register with a few books for the Beaner, I noticed a display of marked-down Moleskines. I bought several, including two of the classic unlined style. When the Beaner saw me unwrap one, he said, "Is that for ME?", and he sounded so excited that I said, "yes, it is." I figured that even though he already has a zillion handy-dandy notebooks, a Moleskine would be kind of special, and since I had two, it wasn't a big deal to part with one.
</p>

<p>
Our next stop was Miller's Smorgasboard (for a good stomach-stuffing before heading back to reality), but it wasn't open yet, so the Beaner and I sat at a table outside reading his new books and drawing in our Moleskines. I drew a picture of him; he requested sketches of Daddy and Mommy, and I obliged. He drew some colorful scribbles and a sketch of me.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon, after we arrived home, we did some more reading and drawing in the basement. I gave the Beaner a purple pencil to draw with, and he gave me an orange one. A few minutes later, he announced, "look, it's my purple squishy car!", and <em>damn</em> if it wasn't.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, it should not be surprising that my Moleskine so far has mostly words in it, rather than drawings. My drawing abilities are slim, and I like to doodle rather than sketch&#8212;and I'd much rather write down funny snippets of overheard conversations or brilliant ideas than either doodle or sketch. Regardless, I think I'll be setting aside Moleskine time for me and the Beaner on a fairly regular basis. It's fun to put down our ideas together.
