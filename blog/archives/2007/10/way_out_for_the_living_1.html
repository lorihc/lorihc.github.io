This photo is very compelling to me right now. I need to print it out and hang it on my wall.

I have a post half-written about all the photos I've been uploading to Flickr lately&#8212;in my experience, when you upload in ginormous batches, most individual shots get only 1 or 2 views each unless you take the time to add them to various group pools&#8212;and that's been the case with almost everything I uploaded since September. I haven't gotten around to finishing that post, mainly because I started to digress into the vagaries of the Vivitar, which required uploading to my site those mis-fires that didn't make it to Flickr. In the interest in just POSTING ALREADY, here are some photos you might have missed:

I've been going bonkers with the Vivitar. I *love* taking it on my morning walks&#8212;and everywhere else. I love that it's focus-free, quiet, and light, and that I never know what I'm going to get. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/vivitaric101/">See all photos tagged with vivitarIC101 here.</a>

I went to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/chicago/">Chicago</a> for Adobe MAX 2007 last week, and I got to go on not one but TWO photowalks with friends. On Monday I met <a href="http://www.freshperspective.com/">Lori</a> for the first time, and on Tuesday I went out with my friend Winsha, who was also there for MAX.

I've been going nuts with the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157600357436377/">bicycle shots</a> these days. The more I photograph them, the more I *want* to photograph them.

<p>wonderful pictures - I especially like the angle that you took the rollerbladers. what kind of Vivatar are you using? And, how can I make my pictures look like your long and narrow ones? Is that something you tweak in editing?</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing, I am eager to go on a photowalk and find a single subject to focus on [pun not intended]</p>

<p>The first photo...yes, compelling and reminescent of our cemetary walks in college. Is that it??</p>

<p>@Gudrun: Thanks! I'm using a Vivitar IC101 panoramic, which is how I'm getting the letterboxed effect. The camera takes regular 35mm film and basically just uses a mask to block out the top and bottom parts of the frame. Luckily the viewfinder also has a mask, so you have some idea of what you'll get. You can <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2007/09/vivitar_ic101.html">read more about the camera in a previous post</a> I wrote about it.</p>

<p>@Josie: It's mostly that the road out of the graveyard reminds me that there is a way out of the pit of despair, a well-marked path to the land of the living. (But yes, the worn stones and fallen leaves are what drew me across the street to take photos in the first place. As you know, I love shooting in graveyards. :)</p>
