<h3 class="title">Let's Get This Party Started!</h3>

<p>
Last night when I put the Beaner to bed I told him that tomorrow would be my birthday, so when I came in to wake him up in the morning, I'd say, "good morning, sunshine!", and he could reply, "happy birthday, Mommy!"
</p>
<p>
I held up my end of the bargain, but he forgot. "Is there something you want to tell me?" I asked. He looked thoughtful, but I could tell he wasn't going to come up with it. <em>"Happy birthday, Mommy!"</em> I whispered in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"It's your birthday?!" he exclaimed, jumping off my lap. "Where are the hats?? We need Blues Clues hats! And we need to set up the house!"
</p>

<p>
"Set up the house?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"You know, for YOUR BIRTHDAY."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean, decorate it with balloons?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes! And paper!" [I think he meant streamers.]
</p>

<p>
"OK, well, I'll see if I can find hats and balloons while I'm out on my morning walk."
</p>

<p>
"Will M___ be coming over with presents?"
</p>

<p>
"No honey, you're thinking of YOUR birthday. It's *my* birthday, so there probably won't be any presents."
</p>

<p>
"But you GOT to have presents!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, when you're 39, there often aren't any presents. Or maybe just one present. It's not such a big deal at this age."
</p>

<p>
[He repeats that I must have presents.]
</p>

<p>
"Presents are more of a kid thing..." I started, but I lost heart. Why ruin it for him? Birthdays are supposed to be BIG! IMPORTANT! OCCASIONS! WITH PRESENTS!
</p>

<p>
I think we'll be stopping at Target on our way down to Virginia tonight to pick up supplies. And maybe even presents.

Happy birthday also to Victor Grigorieff, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and especially to <a href="http://nopasanada.org/">Heather B.</a> Rock on, my fellow October 26 Scorpios!

<p>All I'm saying is that 24 isn't too old for presents neither is 39 (and you are so not 39. Well your birth certificate might say otherwise but you don't look it). So go get yourself something awesome at Target. </p>

<p>Happy, Happy Birthday, Lori! </p>
