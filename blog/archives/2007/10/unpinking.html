<h3 class="title">Un-Pinking</h3>

<p>
My annual rant against breast cancer in general and the pinking of the disease more particularly is over at <a href="http://pinkforoctober.org/2007/10/10/do-something-besides-shop/">Pink For October</a> this year. I wasn't going to bother, since blogging is obviously low on my priority list right now, but when Matthew Oliphant posted <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/fajalar/1516964390/">this photo</a> in his Flickr stream, I couldn't resist.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned at the top of the pink post, I'm going purple for October. As I did last month, I'm doing it as a two step process because I ran out of steam after bleaching. :-) At the moment my hair is mostly white with pink streaks on top. I'm thinking of leaving the white and using the pink streaks as a guide for where to put the purple, but I'll decide for sure later. Oh, and I took the clippers to my head prior to bleaching.

<p>I wish I were brave enough to have purple hair again.</p>

<p>I may, however, be brave enough to chop it all off again.</p>

<p>Soon.</p>

<p>I love your hair -- pink, purple -- whatever... and wow, did you ever lay it out clear about the Shopping Pink for Cancer.  Excellently said.</p>

<p>(I wanted to say, too, that I looked at your San Francisco pictures the other day and experienced a serious undertow of nostalgia for my time there.  The Janis look-alike...  Thanks for having those up!)</p>

<p>I, too, hate the pink breast cancer thing.  I just dealt with cervical cancer this spring and summer, and the last thing I want is someone making that an excuse to shop and cutesify everything.  </p>

<p>I found you via the 'I Dress Like a Slob' Flickr pool.  I just went through your hair history photos and am so impressed that you are so brave with your hair.  I have always thought it would be fun to have purple hair, but have never indulged that fantasy.  It looks awesome.</p>

<p>Thanks, Jill! My philosophy with my hair is, It's Just Hair. When I was younger I used to be very attached to my long blond locks. I thought they were my identity. Then, in college, a guy who thought I was hot said to me, "your hair is not your best feature." He meant that I had other assets, but the sentiment stuck with me: I didn't need to hang onto all that hair. And so, when it got really hot in Washington, DC one summer, I chopped it all off. Shaved the back. From there, it was an easy leap to bleaching and coloring, because I knew I could always cut it off and start over if something didn't work out.</p>

<p>Some colors didn't work as well as others, but the only one I really regret was black. It looked REALLY weird when my blond roots grew in, and I had to wait forever for it to grow long enough to cut off all the black. I was a bit impatient, and I ended up with a very butch haircut that made me a little sad. I then bleached and ended up with white roots and orange tips, which wasn't what I wanted, either. Luckily, I had it sorted within a couple weeks. Learned about patience and what works for me in the process. :-)</p>
