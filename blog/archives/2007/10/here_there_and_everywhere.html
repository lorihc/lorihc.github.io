<h3 class="title">We Interrupt This Woman</h3>

<p>
Just a quick post to say that I'm still alive, if not exactly thriving. I actually feel like I'm coming apart at the seams a bit&#8212;the demands of work, speaking, motherhood, housework, travel, and my spouse's work have combined to suck me very nearly dry.
</p>
<p>
There've been some high points over the past few weeks, but there've been some very, very low ones, too. I've been reluctant to talk about it here because (a) it's public, and though I sometimes *seem* like a very public person... well, there's a limit; and (b) I'm still sorting it all out. I hope to have some regular happy/photo-y/rant-y/beaner-y posts up soon, but if I can't manage, I hope you'll bear with me. I'll be bold in your RSS reader again someday.
