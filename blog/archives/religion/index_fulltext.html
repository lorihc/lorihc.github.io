<h3 class="title">Merry Xmas</h3>

<p>
I've been thinking a lot lately about how Christians in this country seem to feel that they're under attack, and how to mitigate some of that feeling. I think it's important to maintain a secular government&#8212;and given that so many of the founding fathers were deeply religious it's all the more remarkable that we got a secular government at all&#8212;but that those of us who are not particularly religious sometimes take things too far when we insist on <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/jeffwall.html" target="a8_win">separation of church and state</a>. I think we who get so annoyed by those who wear their religion on their sleeves&#8212;we who object to religion being pushed on us&#8212;sometimes fail to realize that we are being just as pushy when we insist that religious symbols be removed from any and all public property and any and all state-, local-, or community-sponsored events. Come on, now. Is it really <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/utah/ci_3271385" target="a8_win">so offensive</a> to have to look at a cross when you're traveling on a Utah highway? And would you know that the land that the cross was on was publicly owned just from driving by it? Would the cross be less offensive if the land were privately owned? 
</p>



<p>
Anyway, it's something I've been thinking about, because although I am not myself religious, and I am often thoroughly freaked out by the religious right, if I am not mistaken what the <a href="http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html" target="a8_win">Constitution</a> says regarding religion is:
</p>

<blockquote>
"...no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States." [Article 4, Clause 3]
</blockquote>

<p>
and
</p>

<blockquote>
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;..." [First Amendment]
</blockquote>

<p>
and... well, that's it.
</p>

<p>
I could write quite a bit about how there should be many more mentions of Article 4 in the same breath that "Supreme Court nominee" is mentioned, but what I'm most interested in at the moment is the First Amendment. I beg those of you who want to keep religion out of government to give your friends and neighbors the opportunity to practice their religions when and where they see fit, before they feel so attacked and oppressed that they go nuts.

</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller">
Note: Although I find the Post article both hilarious and horrifying, I'm actually completely serious about tempering the attacks on religion in this country. Chill out, people. Nobody's trying to make you say anything you don't want to say or believe anything you don't want to believe. Yet.
