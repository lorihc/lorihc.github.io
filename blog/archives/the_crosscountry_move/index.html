 It's moving day, and I'm sick. After an abominable allergy attack yesterday&#8212;brought on, most likely, by (a) being in the same room with Annie for most of the day without a HEPA filter, (b) every bit of dust and dander in the house being released and circulated by the packing activities, and (c) the allergy shot I got at 2pm (what was I thinking?)&#8212;my sinuses, ears, and throat are all congested and sore, and all I want to do...

 I found the practice amp, so that's a relief. I wish Al would hurry up and get here, though&#8212;I've already had to field a couple questions that I didn't know the answers to, and who knows whether I guessed right. God, I could use some ice cream. Some Cake Batter ice cream, with M&Ms and colored sprinkles mixed in, from Coldstone Creamery would do nicely. That, and a shot of wheatgrass juice, would bring me one step closer to...

 The packers are here, and Annie and I are freaking out a little. I can't find the practice amp for my bass guitar (which I should have set aside last night, but didn't), and I'm worried that there's something else I forgot to set aside. I figure at the rate these guys are packing, they might be close to done by the time that Al gets here around noon....

 It's a good thing I didn't go hog wild messing up the house last night, because the buyer's parents are in town, and he wants to bring them by tomorrow to show them this fantastic little house he's bought. So tomorrow I will get up early and run through the house-preparation routine as usual. It really doesn't bother me; Al is coming home from Philly tomorrow, too, and I wanted the house to look especially spiffy for him anyway....

 Our house is now officially listed as Pending: Do Not Show, which is a huge relief. I kinda want to mess the house up to celebrate, but I probably won't. I've grown too accustomed to its limited-lived-in look, and I now can't seem to take something out without putting it away as soon as I'm done. This is probably a good thing, and how other civilized people act. However, there will be a letting down of the guard, so...

 I have yet to tell many of my farther-flung friends that we are moving to Philadelphia; Al is in charge of getting a P.O. box (so we'll have a semi-permanent address) and an apartment (so we'll have a temporary place to live until we find a house) this week, and I was going to send out missives about the move as soon as I had the P.O. Box address to pass on. Those who read my blog are ahead...

<div class="blogbody">
 We got an offer on our house yesterday, so we slept with the comforter on the bed last night to celebrate. (We've been removing it every night and sleeping with an old blanket instead, and then reassembling the bed in the morning.) Of course, it's totally wrinkled now, which vexes me greatly. (Sorry, I've got Pride & Prejudice on the brain.) I wouldn't care so much if we were done showing the house, but its official status is "Pending...

 It's been a while since I've written, but I have big news: We're moving to Philadelphia. I've known that it was a possibility for a while, but I didn't know for sure that it would really happen until a little over a week ago, and I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure. There will probably be many more posts with photographs of things I'm throwing away, along with few words about why I kept them...
