</div>

 So I've had a bulging vein in the back of my right leg for oh, I guess a few years now. Maybe as many as 12 years? It's hard to remember, because I mostly ignored it until maybe two years ago. I think this vein was around when I was pregnant; I certainly remember having a painful bulging vein in my inner thigh, just above the knee, when I was pregnant, but that went away afterward. In any case,...

 I've got a lot of things I want to write about on the parenting front, but I've been sitting on them because I'm not sure I want to share publicly. It's a funny thing how sometimes you'd rather share with random strangers than with those closest to you; in those cases, since many close friends and family members read my blog regularly, I usually choose to keep the posts to myself. I either write them in a paper journal,...

 I feel like Goldilocks, in search of the perfect t-shirt. WHY is it SO HARD to find something that won't leave my ass crack exposed when I sit (or my belly button exposed when I stand, for that matter) while at the same time being flattering? Is my waist so long, my tits so small, and my ass so big that there is no happy medium to be found anywhere? There has to be something between this:...

 I am coveting these boots. I have visions of transforming my wardrobe into something Gala would wear, because honestly? That's what I feel like inside. It's only on the outside that I'm a Gap Tall-and-blue jeans-wearing 38 year-old. What if the inside were to manifest itself on the outside? It sorta already does, in my hair, but lately I've been considering a more drastic leap....

 Have I mentioned that I'm in the process of replacing my entire stock of tops (shirts, sweaters, etc.) with offerings from Gap Tall? I'm doing this because now that I have three shirts whose sleeves reach my wrists, I WANT MORE. Suddenly all the shirts and sweaters that have always been a little short in the torso and the arms look even more ridiculous than they did before, because now I know that there's an alternative....

 Ratphooey has got me hooked on the idea of boots, and I'm now considering whether I want to splurge on a pair of Steven Lanaas. The question is, brown or black?...
