 Wow, it's hard to believe that we're 10 years away from Y2K now... and yet somehow I'm not sure that a century really gets rolling until about 20 years in. Perhaps because it's so awkward to refer to the 00s and the 10s? Much easier to point to the 20s, 30s, etc. (Speaking of which, I wonder if the 20s will be "roaring" this time around?)...

And the women at the Walgreens photo counter are starting to miss me and my negatives only + CD orders, too....

 The Beaner has his own film camera (a cheap-o model purchased at Walgreens for about $8, which includes a free film refill every time we bring in a roll from it for developing), and I've given him disposables to shoot with, too. As for digital cameras, he has two or three toy ones, all of which produce images of perfectly horrible quality (the ones I'm able to download off of, anyway; one refuses to connect to any computer we...

 Last year when my women's hockey team drove up to Bethlehem to play the Lehigh Valley Wicked, I discovered on arrival that the rink at which we were to play was situated next to a derelict steel mill. The thing was gorgeous in its decay, with tall, rusty tubes and stacks contrasting beautifully with the blue sky, and blasted bricks and gaping windows framing empty innards. I made a mental note to bring the good camera with me next...

 Can somebody tell me why this is my most-viewed Flickr photo of all time?

 I've been envying Heather's ability to create time-lapse movies and secretly coveting her Canon SD870. At the same time, I've been kinda disappointed with the picture quality produced by my Finepix F30. It's supposed to be a FINEpix, for cripes sake, not a muddy pix, which is what I usually get. The Finepix was kind of expensive for a point-and-shoot, though, and I do love it for video, so I resigned myself to waiting a while before acquiring another...

 I finally got the roll of film that was in the Vivitar Ultra Wide &amp; Slim back, and thus I was able to finish off my My Every Day set on Flickr last night.

 Just before I left for the Tech Summit in San Jose last month, Apple Cider Slim sent me a Minox PL (and a Rollei flash!) that he'd picked up at a garage sale a while back and never got around to using. It was an incredibly generous gesture that I still haven't gotten around to thanking him properly for (that would be via actual hard-copy thank-you note). Sadly, neither the Minox nor I seem to be equal to this...

 I have a little list of things I've been wanting to write about, but which I haven't had time to address as of yet (and yes, I'm still behind on my e-mail&#8212;if I owe you one, hopefully you'll hear from me soon). Part of the problem&#8212;which isn't really a problem at all, given that usually we're homebodies who don't do much of anything&#8212;is that we're too busy DOING THINGS and HAVING FUN for me to keep up with, well,...

 Al took this photo of my sister and me with his cameraphone a couple weekends ago. Even though it's not the most flattering snap of either of us, I love it. Maybe it's the way we're interacting, or the fact that we're looking at the photos she took earlier that day, or that you can kinda see the resemblence between us. Whatever it is, I'm so glad he captured it....

 My mother-in-law was kind enough to give each of her daughters-in-law a bit of walking around money this weekend, and I've been trying to decide what to do with it. I need to decide soon, before the extra cash burns a hole in my pocket and encourages me to blow it all on extra decaf short lattes at Starbucks....

 Austen is getting his molars. We noticed the little white prongs sticking up when he opened his mouth (probably to laugh) about a week ago, and they've been coming in fast ever since. At least one on either side of his mouth is totally above the surface now. We don't know if the molars are the reason Austen's been waking up screaming at 5:45 lately (instead of 6:00, 6:15, or 6:45, as usual); it might also be the extra...

 I love visiting Derek's site because in addition to great writing, great photographs, and great links, This Is Powazek is also full of great ideas. Today's interesting idea: create a mosaic of photos from your Flickr stream (or your favorites list, or any other photos on the web). I've used Picasa2's Collage feature to create mosaics before (most notably the one commemorating Austen's first year), so the mosaic part isn't the great idea. It's that Derek chose to make...

 Austen and I returned, along with Al (who flew up to Hartford to meet us on Sunday), from Maine on Monday. We had great weather every day except Sunday (which was foggy and drizzly), and especially on Saturday, when the air was brisk but not cold, the sun was warm but not roasty, and the wind was cool but not frigid. Perfect Dreamweaver fleece weather. Val, Austen, and I started the day with a hike around Mackworth Island just...

 It's time to clear my backlog of scribbled-on-hotel-stationery notes, most of which pertain to our trip to Boston on the 7th. Al had a meeting there on the 8th, and we decided to make a weekend of it so Austen and his godmother could meet each other, and so the three of us could have a little family vacation. The drive there was pretty easy; Austen didn't cry at all, and we made good time despite a stop at...

 I have so many things I want to blog about that there's a sort of logjam in my brain.

In college I combatted this tendency to become overwhelmed and just go back to bed by scheduling my days in 15-minute increments so I could see that it...

 A few weeks ago I was down in the basement doing some laundry, and I set Austen on the couch for a few minutes so I could unload the dryer.

That's when I remembered that I have two or three film cameras, and that they're all in the basement. I pulled out my favorite, my dad's old...

 I can't quite believe it, but I found ALL the images that go in the about town (san francisco) blog on various backup CDs. I hope I'm as lucky with about town II (philadelphia).

Although it started on this site, the entries I'm adding now are really about Al's hockey experiences as much as mine. So it seems fitting that...

 This weekend Al and I were in San Francisco for the beautiful wedding of two friends. When the officiant asked the bride's father, who walked her down the aisle, &quot;who gives this woman in holy matrimony?&quot;, the father replied in a booming voice, &quot;she gives herself!&quot; All RIGHT!! As the bride and groom joined hands, the officiant said some things about marriage that I can't begin to articulate now but that were so true they made my heart burst...

 I've finally posted my mayday photos.

I had considered posting larger versions of the photos, linked from the thumbnails, but I liked the thumbnails so well that I left them as-is. Oh, and in other photographic news, my photo of tea...

 Oh, I meant to announce also that about town has moved. Movable Type categories seemed a perfect match for about town, so I've spent the past two days entering the old photos (and some new ones) into MT and categorizing them. I'm very happy with the results, I must say&#8212;and as with all my other web journals, moving to MT will likely mean that about town will get updated more frequently....
