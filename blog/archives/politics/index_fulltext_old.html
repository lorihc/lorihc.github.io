<p>
Gubernatorial sounds an awful lot like goobernatorial, especially when it's used in a sentence that also contain the words "Arnold Schwartzenegger." Maybe we should get <a href="http://www.tvacres.com/char_pyle_goober.htm" target="a8_win">George Lindsey</a> to run. Why not? <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/gate/special/pages/2003/recall/" target="a8_win">everybody else</a> is.

<h3 class="title">On the Ability to Beat Bush</h3>

<p>
It seems like every interview I hear or read these days with average-Joe Democrats on whom they're going to vote for in the primary has the following gist: "I just want to vote for the guy who can beat Bush." I'm wondering: Is there any Democratic candidate who is so compelling to Republicans that they'll vote for him instead of Bush? And, given this "anybody but Bush" sentiment, is there any Democrat who will vote for Bush just because s/he doesn't care for the Democratic nominee?
</p>

<p>
My guess, on both fronts, is no. So I guess my real question is: Is there *anybody* who will vote for Bush *solely* because they don't care for the Democratic nominee? And, conversely, is there any Democrat currently in the race who could compel an Independent/Libertarian/Other who voted for Bush last time around to vote Democratic this time? Or is the concern over the ability to beat Bush really a concern that if the "wrong" candidate is nominated, people faced with two unpalatable choices won't vote at all, and that this somehow favors Bush?
</p>

<p>
I guess there are enough "swing" voters&#8212;that is, voters who decide for whom they will vote based on personality, stance on a specific issue, or the lesser of two evils, regardless of party affiliation&#8212;to make the difference in this election. Bill Clinton did beat a sitting Republican president, after all (though probably with the help of Ross Perot, who drew votes from Bush the Elder); Michael Dukakis seemed to lose solely because he was portrayed as weak and dorky; and Reagan was loved (or at least preferred to a Democratic party in disarray) by all but die-hard liberals. I might just be hanging out too much with folks who are at one end of the political spectrum or the other (and I might be too far to one end myself) to fully appreciate the power&#8212;and the motivations&#8212;of the undecideds in the middle, but is the choice between any Democratic nominee and George W. Bush all that difficult to make?
</p>

<p>
I'm curious: What goes into your decision about which candidate to vote for in the general elections (not the primaries)? Do you identify strongly with one party or another? If not&#8212;like me&#8212;do you consider yourself liberal or conservative on specific issues that tend to align you with one party or another, even though you might be registered as NPA or Independent? Do you have a litmus test for your candidate (for example, you'll only vote for a candidate who is pro-choice or pro-life)? If the candidate you voted for in the primary (if applicable) doesn't end up being your party's nominee, are you less likely to vote?
</p>

<p>
Personal attacks or hateful rhetoric will be edited out, so consider stating your case without them.
