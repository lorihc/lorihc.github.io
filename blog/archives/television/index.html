 I've been working on a long post for days now, and it's holding back a flood of smaller items. I've decided just to let loose with the small stuff, and get the longer post up as soon as I can....

 Those of us with cable (as opposed to satellite) will still be able to follow the Red Sox around the country this baseball season, thanks to a last-minute deal between iN Demand and MLB. Thanks also to Senator John Kerry (from Mass., natch) for the "whoa, wait a minute there" when the exclusive deal with DirecTV was announced a few weeks ago. Full story here: Baseball Keeps 'Extra Innings' on Cable....

 As a kid, I was NOT a fan of Star Trek. I WAS a fan of Star Wars, and it used to bug me royally when people would confuse the two or mistake me for a Trekkie. After I married Al, however, Star Trek started to grow on me a little. It's still probably not a show I'd ever watch on my own, but I enjoy watching it with Al, who explains all the relationships between the characters and...

 I think I'd be worn out from yesterday's migraine anyway, even if I hadn't stayed up until almost midnight for the past two nights to watch a Frontline on Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, George Tenet, and the way the intelligence communities (not to mention a Secretary of State) were used and abused between 9/11 and the runup to the invasion of Iraq. I did stay up to watch that documentary, however, and now I'm exhausted&#8212;and fascinated....

 Things I'm enjoying but don't have time to write individual posts about: John Adams, by David McCullough Honeymoon With My Brother hadn't come in yet at the library, and I was in the mood for more Revolutionary generation reading anyway after finishing Founding Brothers, so I picked this up at the branch library off Rittenhouse Square (called the Philadelphia City Institute branch, not Rittenhouse, strangely enough) last week. I was a bit worried by its size, and that it...

Al and I started watching the third season of Project Greenlight tonight. I know Matt Damon is mad about having to make a shit movie, but I'd like to say to Matt and everyone else: This show isn't about making a good movie. It's about interoffice politics, decisionmaking, communicating, resolving conflicts. You could do a whole B-school class around this show. In fact, I think someone *should* do a whole B-school class around this show. I know I learned a...

 Al and I are watching that new show Numbers right now&#8212;or at least, Al is. I'm only half-listening to it and mocking it periodically while I write a blog post on breast milk. I'd had high hopes for the show, but Al reminded me that it was on CBS, home of CSI (which practically destroyed my longtime fascination with forensic science). I should have listened to him and lowered my expectations... though I'm not sure I could have gotten...

 As my friend Hoche reflected the other night, it's easier to shift your schedule later (as in, get up later in the morning, stay up later at night) than it is to shift it earlier. It's so true: as much as I love early mornings, when no one else is up except the birds and the first rays of sun, I am finding it hard to drag myself out of bed before 8:30 these days (and sometimes I dally...

 I watched the American Experience episode on Seabiscuit last night (we Tivo'ed it, which accounts for the 1 day lag). For me, the book was a bit too long, but the TV program left me wanting more (perhaps another 30 minutes or so?). I'm glad they left out some of the (what I thought were) extraneous details, such as Charles Howard's beginnings in San Francisco and the shitpile and brothel in Tijuana, but I wanted more on how Seabiscuit...
