<h3 class="title">Agile in Action</h3>

<p>
Recently I started a new Flickr set called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157623410034003/" target="_blank">Scrum in Practice</a>, and I've been using it to collect photos of my team (and others at CIM) practicing, as the name suggests, <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/learn_about_scrum" target="_blank">Scrum</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/4425470497/" title="63: focus on the board by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2686/4425470497_7e199f9486_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="63: focus on the board" class="inline-right" /></a>Even more recently, a colleague came down to take some photos of us working for a presentation one of the executives was planning to give. He's a better photographer than I, so I can't wait to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/burntsienna/4439697360/in/photostream/">see what he got</a>... and of course I immediately wished I could include his photos in my Flickr set.
</p>

<p>
Aha! I thought: I'll start a group, and I'll call it <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/agile-in-action/pool/" target="_blank">Agile in Action</a>. Sadly, the name was already taken, but the upside is that it was taken for the same purpose: As a way of sharing the working environments and artifacts of Agile teams.
</p>

<p>
There are only 11 members of that group now, and only a few photos in the group pool, so I'd like to make a pitch to other Agile practitioners who use Flickr to join and send photos of your teams, your work setups, your Kanban boards and burndown charts, or any other Scrum/Agile artifacts you've found useful. I'm not a group owner or moderator (and therefore I can't change the generic group icon); I'd just like to share ideas with other practitioners through photographs. Won't you be my ScrumNeighbor?
