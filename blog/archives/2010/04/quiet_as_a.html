<h3 class="title">Quiet as A...</h3>

<p>
Due to a schedule change with our nanny, Al and I are now responsible for picking the Beaner up from school on the days when he gets out at noon. We split duties, each taking a different day.
</p>
<p>
Last week, my day was a particularly hectic one, so instead of bringing the Beaner home and waiting for Shawna, I brought him to work with me and asked Shawna to pick him up there. 
</p>

<p>
We stopped at Ralph's on 43 to get the Beaner a slice of pizza and an apple juice, and then we went back down to Awesome Central, the area in the SW corner of 15 that we've claimed for co-working for the past few weeks. Awesome Central was full, since the whole team was in the office, so I pulled up an extra chair so close to mine that I would have been elbowing the Beaner constantly if I moused on the right side.
</p>

<p>
He happily added sticky notes to the board (items like "I alweys love you mom &lt;3" and just plain "&lt;3"), and then he just sat there, happily eating his pizza while I tried to solve a Production problem. A few minutes later, I was describing said problem to another team member as resulting from "users pressing the buttons continuously like monkeys" (completely mixing my metaphors in the process&#8212;I was thinking of both rats pressing the feeder bar to get a pellet and monkeys on typewriters banging out Shakespeare) when the Beaner totally startled me by going, "ooh ooh eee eee aah aah."
</p>

<p>
I jumped, and the rest of the team laughed. I'd totally forgotten he was there, despite his proximity. A few minutes later Shawna txted me that she was in the lobby, so I packed the Beaner up. On the way down, I commended him for his good behavior and remarked that he was so quiet and well-behaved that I'd forgotten about him.
</p>

<p>
"I was as quiet as a chicken," he said proudly.
</p>

<p>
In my head I was thinking, "chickens make 'bock bock' noises. They're not particularly quiet." But then he clarified.
</p>

<p>
"Chickens are the quiet ones. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)#Meetings">It's the pigs who speak, right?</a>"
