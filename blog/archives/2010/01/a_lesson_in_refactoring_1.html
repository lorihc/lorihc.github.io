<h3 class="title">A Lesson in Refactoring</h3>

<p>
Shawna gave the Beaner an enormous marble run as a combined birthday/Christmas gift, and I finally got to see it in action the other day. It took up the whole play table, involved two conveyor belts, and had innumerable tubes, chutes, flaps, lights, and whistles. <em>Very cool.</em>
</p>
<p>
"Can you reconfigure it any way you want?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sure," said the Beaner. "Let's take it apart."
</p>

<p>
"OK, I'll just move this piece over here..."
</p>

<p>
"No, no! You have to take the whole thing apart."
</p>

<p>
"Oh. Well, I was thinking that we could just move one piece at a time."
</p>

<p>
"No, you're doing it wrong! You have to take the whole thing apart and start over if you want to build it differently."
</p>

<p>
"But see, if we move one piece at a time 20 or 30 times, we'll end up with a completely different configuration&#8212;but with each move, we'll still have a working marble run."
</p>

<p>
"NO. YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE WHOLE THING APART IF YOU WANT TO RECONFIGURE IT."
</p>

<p>
It should not be surprising, even to engineers who argue the Beaner's position all the time, that the marble run stayed in pieces on the table for the next five days.

<p>I think "staying in pieces" is what's called "Alpha."</p>
