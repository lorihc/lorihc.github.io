<h3 class="title">Bad Blogger, Great Kid</h3>

<p>
OK, so obviously I fell off the NaBloPoMo wagon. I found that I just didn't have enough material to write about every day&#8212;at least at length. I have things on my mind, but that doesn't mean I want to sit down and expound upon them anymore, apparently.
</p>
<p>
I did want to say here, today, that the Beaner has been pretty dreamy lately. He's amazingly independent, he's a downright fantastic reader and writer, and he's even been impressing me with his manners. Rather heartbreakingly, he said to me the other day, "I don't want to disappoint you, Mom," which I think reflects as poorly on me as a mother as it does positively on him as a son. Yeah, I'm a mom who probably expresses disappointment way too often.

Lately his favorite thing to do is watch the entire <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKTY?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00005JKTY" target="_blank">School House Rock DVD</a> in order or on shuffle. The multiplication tables are a bit of a puzzler for him, and all the songs probably seem more catchy than educational, but (probably not surprisingly, given his facility with reading, writing, and other language work at school) the Grammar Rock ones seem to be sinking in a bit.
</p>

<p>
It helps that *I* love the whole School House Rock series, too, and know the words to most of the songs. Coming down to the living room to watch the DVD with the Beaner has become my favorite thing about Saturday mornings, partly for the snuggling, and partly for the shared connection to the past&#8212;it reminds me of how I spent Saturday mornings when I was a kid.
</p>

<p>
Plus, it's a nice way to revive a connection with my kid at a time when I felt like his Dad was doing most of the parenting and playing. There's nothing more gratifying than being asked to sing the Preamble to the Constitution in Wegmans while pushing a cart with one hand and holding your five year-old's hand with the other&#8212;except perhaps being able to belt it out in tune.
