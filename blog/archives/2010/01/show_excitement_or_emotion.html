<h3 class="title">Show Excitement or Emotion</h3>

<p>
Enjoyed a lovely, if bitterly cold, day in Princeton with Al and the Beaner. We spent the morning exploring and photographing the Princeton University campus (photos to follow; I shot a few with the 10D and a couple with the Vivitar Ultra Wide & Slim), then warmed up with tea and apple cider at Starbucks.

</p>

<p>
We stopped for picnic supplies at Olives (nicely remodeled since our last visit); spent an hour at our favorite toy store (Jazams!), where I made a long list of books I plan to buy for the Beaner in the next couple years (The Mouse and the Motorcycle, FTW!) and bought one from the young adult section for myself; admired the recycled goodness at the Terracycle store (the Beaner was in HEAVEN); and then made our way to the well-hidden Hobey Baker Rink for the highlight of my day (and this was a very good day!)... a Princeton womens hockey game!

</p>

<p>
It was awesome! The rink was nice, the view was great, and the hustle the Princeton players showed was fucking inspiring. Even better, the Beaner didn't get bored until 15:00 in the 3rd period (woo!). He wasn't too thrilled with my yelling and cheering (too loud), except for when I yelled "OHHHH!" on a shot that hit the crossbar. He said, "hey Mom, did you know that you just said an interjection?"
</p>

<p>
Why yes! I did know that. :-)
</p>

<p>
After the game (which Princeton won 1-0 on an amazing centering pass to DiCesare driving down the slot), the Beaner showed off his new dog paddling skills at an indoor pool. More interjections ensued.
