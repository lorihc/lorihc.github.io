<h3 class="title">Janus</h3>

<p>
Wow, it's hard to believe that we're 10 years away from Y2K now... and yet somehow I'm not sure that a century really gets rolling until about 20 years in. Perhaps because it's so awkward to refer to the 00s and the 10s? Much easier to point to the 20s, 30s, etc. (Speaking of which, I wonder if the 20s will be "roaring" this time around?)
</p>

<p>
In any case&#8212;perhaps because of the turn of the decade, perhaps because it feels like the economic and social problems we're having now seem unlikely to resolve themselves in a single year&#8212;I find myself looking not just back at the past year and forward to the year ahead, but back at the past few years and forward to the next few years. 2012 looks promising.
</p>

<p>
Sorry, I wasn't really going anywhere with that; it's just the state of my brain on this New Year's Day morning. Or part of it, anyway. The rest is consumed with mulling over my best experiences of the past year and decade, and with whether I want to do another 365 photography/Flickr project this year. I think I will miss doing such a project if I don't, and yet there were times this year when it felt like a chore, or that I didn't make an effort to get a photo that really captured the day (and was sorry for it later). It often happens that when I'm really living in the moment, I don't think to photograph it. (I should write a whole separate post about that, if I haven't already&#8212;about how I get the best photos of an occasion when I'm not really participating in it, and conversely, how if I'm really enjoying myself and am actively engaged, I get no photos at all.)
</p>

<p>
For 2009, I decided late that I *would* do a 365 project (or maybe I decided early, but forgot that I'd decided?), and ended up with a photo of the Beaner for the first day instead of the self-portrait I'd intended. From then I resolved to stick with the self-portraits... but there were some days, as I said, that my heart wasn't in it. And then there were other days where I felt like what I was *doing* was more important than my face, or where the day wasn't about me at all. More Beaner photos, more family photos, more locations shots. Apparently, I resist themes... or sub-themes, as it were, since 365 is already a theme. 365 days in the life seems good enough.
</p>

<p>
Here's my 365 set from 2009. If you have the patience to watch the whole slideshow (why you would, I have no idea; I'm only up to April myself as of this writing) and notice that some days are missing, it's because almost any photo with the Beaner in it is marked Friends & Family only. Although for all I know, embedding the whole shebang here will cause that setting to be ignored.
</p>

<p>
It's weird to look back over the year and see myself drinking coffee (I haven't had coffee in months), microwaving meals (ditto), looking a little chubby (I lost about 5 lbs. when I moved to a mostly-raw + cheese + chocolate diet), enjoying unemployment. I'm also glad I chose to include video occasionally (but sparingly). OK, I'm sold. This is a really nice way to capture a year. Onward to 365 for 2010!

<h3 class="title">Show Excitement or Emotion</h3>

<p>
Enjoyed a lovely, if bitterly cold, day in Princeton with Al and the Beaner. We spent the morning exploring and photographing the Princeton University campus (photos to follow; I shot a few with the 10D and a couple with the Vivitar Ultra Wide & Slim), then warmed up with tea and apple cider at Starbucks.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/4237602142/" title="sitting in the window at Starbucks by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4024/4237602142_45441756f3.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="sitting in the window at Starbucks" /></a>
</p>

<p>
We stopped for picnic supplies at Olives (nicely remodeled since our last visit); spent an hour at our favorite toy store (Jazams!), where I made a long list of books I plan to buy for the Beaner in the next couple years (The Mouse and the Motorcycle, FTW!) and bought one from the young adult section for myself; admired the recycled goodness at the Terracycle store (the Beaner was in HEAVEN); and then made our way to the well-hidden Hobey Baker Rink for the highlight of my day (and this was a very good day!)... a Princeton womens hockey game!
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/4237257367/" title="at a Princeton womens hockey game by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4021/4237257367_2d7bcb8eca.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="at a Princeton womens hockey game" /></a>
</p>

<p>
It was awesome! The rink was nice, the view was great, and the hustle the Princeton players showed was fucking inspiring. Even better, the Beaner didn't get bored until 15:00 in the 3rd period (woo!). He wasn't too thrilled with my yelling and cheering (too loud), except for when I yelled "OHHHH!" on a shot that hit the crossbar. He said, "hey Mom, did you know that you just said an interjection?"
</p>

<p>
Why yes! I did know that. :-)
</p>

<p>
After the game (which Princeton won 1-0 on an amazing centering pass to DiCesare driving down the slot), the Beaner showed off his new dog paddling skills at an indoor pool. More interjections ensued. 
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Glow</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416927271?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1416927271"><img alt="froginthebog.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/froginthebog.jpg" class="inline-right" width="160" height="124" /></a>Still have a glow from a lovely weekend in Princeton... or maybe it's the cold-mulled wine I've been drinking for the past couple hours. Hard to tell. It could also be the cheery feeling that reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416927271?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1416927271" target="_blank">A Frog in the Bog</a> to the Beaner gives me, and the happy memory of <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2008/01/pittsburgh.html">buying that book in Pittsburgh</a> this time two years ago.
</p>

<p>
I had such a nice New Year's weekend that I'm not looking forward to returning to work tomorrow, even though I like my job and feel like I'm in the right role for me, finally. (Although I have to say, re-watching the first couple seasons of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ERXC2?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0002ERXC2" target="_blank">The Wire</a> over the holiday break has reminded me it's not just about the work and taking care of your people, it's about reporting up and not ruffling feathers&#8212;two things I rather suck at. &lt;sigh&gt; So much for the joy of a good engineering process, low bug counts, a solid product, and happy, effective engineers.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, back to the glow. Some of it just might be from the crudit&eacute; salad I made for dinner tonight. I tell you, I feel so <em>fantastic</em> when I eat mostly raw, no matter how much I might think I want Chick-Fil-A waffle fries for lunch or Ritter Sport Marzipan bars for breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Wait, mostly <em>what?</em>
</p>

<p>
Uh,  yeah. Since April of 2009, I've been eating what I now refer to as the Lori Diet: lots of raw fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, plus some cheese and a lot of chocolate. I don't shun cooked food entirely; I just eat it sparingly, choosing raw options whenever possible. Don't try to understand it; there aren't any rules you'll be able to follow to feed me, I can almost guarantee. If there's a salad on the menu, I'm good. If you have some apples or cauliflower or Korean pears in the house, I'm all set. And if you don't, not to worry; I've learned to travel with a few Lara or Organic Food bars, some raw sunflower seeds, or some raw cashews and dried cranberries in my purse. (Or, as I did this Christmas, a bag of carrots, a lemon, a fennel bulb, some cranberries, two apples, and a Japanese mandoline in a reusable shopping bag. I supplemented with the grapes, broccoli, cauliflower, and olive oil that my mom had on hand.)
</p>

<p>
I don't own a dehydrator (yet), but thanks to some birthday money from my in-laws and some saving on my part, I'm now the proud owner of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OSDSTI?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000OSDSTI" target="_blank">high-speed blender</a>, with which I make a daily breakfast smoothie&#8212;usually some combination of banana, pineapple, and whatever fruit is in season, though cilantro and spinach-mint are also favorite bases, and I loooove key lime pie smoothies made from apple, banana, avocado, and of course limes. (Before I got the Blend-Tec, I used a regular Waring bar blender, which didn't get smoothies and juices as smooth, but was perfectly functional.)
</p>

<p>
I make my own raw nut milk, which I use to make chia pudding (yes, made from ch-ch-ch-chia seeds). I occasionally eat sea vegetables in salads. And my olive intake, already high, has gone up.
</p>

<p>
I don't claim that this is the "right" diet for anyone else but me. And since there are no rules to it, there's nothing I <em>can't</em> eat; only things that I <em>prefer not to</em> eat. What I do try to avoid consistently are wheat and meat... but then, I've been avoiding meat for over 20 years, and I've been avoiding wheat for more than one. (I actually think that giving up wheat a little over a year ago made the transition to a high-raw diet easier, if you're interested and want to start slowly.)
</p>

<p>
I still eat sushi once in a while. Ditto cooked vegetables. And a really excellent piece of cooked fish makes me happy, too. I don't care that maple syrup isn't raw, or that "raw" almonds grown in California have been pasteurized. (Well, yes, I care, but I'm not going to go to great expense to buy really raw almonds from Spain.) I care that eating a bowl of raw vegetables makes me feel alive like no other food can. That I can fill up at a meal and not feel weighed down. That I'm eating rainbow-colored dishes without an FD&amp;C numbered dye in sight.
</p>

<p>
And now, two recipes, in case you're curious about the aforementioned wine and crudit&eacute; salad:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Crudit&eacute; Salad</strong>
</p>

<p>
A few broccoli florets, roughly chopped<br />
A few cauliflower florets, roughly chopped<br />
1 or 2 carrots, grated<br />
A handful or two of grated red cabbage<br />
5-10 pitted kalamata or oil-cured olives, chopped<br />
One small handful dried dulse, rinsed, squeezed, and chopped (optional)<br />
Sesame seeds (optional)<br />
Lemon juice &amp; olive oil
</p>

<p>
Toss vegetables and sesame seeds in a bowl with lemon juice and olive oil to taste (I use about 1/2 lemon and maybe 2-3 T. olive oil). You can substitute crumbled feta cheese for the lemon-olive oil dressing, or use both. In the summer, I'll add chopped cucumber and grape tomatoes as well. Tonight I used all the listed ingredients for myself, and gave Al a serving with feta instead of dulse.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/4061812815/" title="Halloween salad by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3486/4061812815_60f3ab12ae.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Halloween salad" /></a><br />
A version of the Crudit&eacute; Salad I made on Halloween, using orange cauliflower instead of the usual white
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cold-Mulled Wine</strong>
</p>

<p>
1 glass nice red wine (I used a 2006 or 2007 Mas Carlot Les Enfants Terribles, which is some kind of Syrah blend that Al got as a gift)<br />
1 small squirt (1 t.?) raw agave nectar<br />
1 whole clove<br />
dash vanilla extract (1/8 t.? 1/4 t.?)<br />
dash cinnamon (optional)
</p>

<p>
Combine ingredients in a juice glass and stir. Taste, and add more agave if desired. The vanilla and clove will mellow, and the taste will improve, with time. Sip slowly!
</p>

<h3 class="title">A Lesson in Refactoring</h3>

<p>
Shawna gave the Beaner an enormous marble run as a combined birthday/Christmas gift, and I finally got to see it in action the other day. It took up the whole play table, involved two conveyor belts, and had innumerable tubes, chutes, flaps, lights, and whistles. <em>Very cool.</em>
</p>

<p>
"Can you reconfigure it any way you want?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sure," said the Beaner. "Let's take it apart."
</p>

<p>
"OK, I'll just move this piece over here..."
</p>

<p>
"No, no! You have to take the whole thing apart."
</p>

<p>
"Oh. Well, I was thinking that we could just move one piece at a time."
</p>

<p>
"No, you're doing it wrong! You have to take the whole thing apart and start over if you want to build it differently."
</p>

<p>
"But see, if we move one piece at a time 20 or 30 times, we'll end up with a completely different configuration&#8212;but with each move, we'll still have a working marble run."
</p>

<p>
"NO. YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE WHOLE THING APART IF YOU WANT TO RECONFIGURE IT."
</p>

<p>
It should not be surprising, even to engineers who argue the Beaner's position all the time, that the marble run stayed in pieces on the table for the next five days.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Good Day, Few Words</h3>

<p>
Even though nothing spectacularly good happened (in fact, a few things went wrong on the deployment front at work), today felt like a good day. I walked home happy. I got two giant and soothing hugs from the Beaner. I ate a lovely arugula salad and drank a pineapple-banana-Korean pear smoothie for dinner. I finished off some work e-mails, placed a drugstore.com order, uploaded a few photos from the Princeton trip, and now I'm calling it a night. That's enough.

<h3 class="title">Damn Hackers</h3>

<p>
Instead of blogging about the connection between work and Richie Cunningham tonight, as I had planned to do, I spent the past couple hours cleaning up even more crap files left on my site by hackers. (I cleaned up a ton more the other night.)
</p>


<p>
Oh well; at least I got to brush up on my unix command-line skills.</p>

<h3 class="title">Bad Blogger, Great Kid</h3>

<p>
OK, so obviously I fell off the NaBloPoMo wagon. I found that I just didn't have enough material to write about every day&#8212;at least at length. I have things on my mind, but that doesn't mean I want to sit down and expound upon them anymore, apparently.
</p>

<p>
I did want to say here, today, that the Beaner has been pretty dreamy lately. He's amazingly independent, he's a downright fantastic reader and writer, and he's even been impressing me with his manners. Rather heartbreakingly, he said to me the other day, "I don't want to disappoint you, Mom," which I think reflects as poorly on me as a mother as it does positively on him as a son. Yeah, I'm a mom who probably expresses disappointment way too often.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/4274598641/" title="photo.jpg by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4274598641_6258fa0b5f.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="photo.jpg" /></a>

Lately his favorite thing to do is watch the entire <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKTY?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00005JKTY" target="_blank">School House Rock DVD</a> in order or on shuffle. The multiplication tables are a bit of a puzzler for him, and all the songs probably seem more catchy than educational, but (probably not surprisingly, given his facility with reading, writing, and other language work at school) the Grammar Rock ones seem to be sinking in a bit.
</p>

<p>
It helps that *I* love the whole School House Rock series, too, and know the words to most of the songs. Coming down to the living room to watch the DVD with the Beaner has become my favorite thing about Saturday mornings, partly for the snuggling, and partly for the shared connection to the past&#8212;it reminds me of how I spent Saturday mornings when I was a kid.
</p>

<p>
Plus, it's a nice way to revive a connection with my kid at a time when I felt like his Dad was doing most of the parenting and playing. There's nothing more gratifying than being asked to sing the Preamble to the Constitution in Wegmans while pushing a cart with one hand and holding your five year-old's hand with the other&#8212;except perhaps being able to belt it out in tune.

<h3 class="title">The Moral of the Story</h3>

<p>
At breakfast the other morning, the Beaner held up a book with an orange cover (yes, we allow books and magazines at the table, though I sweep them away if I notice he's not eating) and announced, "Mom, it just occurred to me what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394800168?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0394800168">Green Eggs and Ham</a> is about."
</p>

<p>
"What's that, boo?"
</p>

<p>
"It's about no-thank-you helpings."
</p>

<p>
"That's exactly right, boo. It *is* about no-thank-you helpings."
</p>

<p>
I was impressed with his rudimentary literary analysis, but this conversation also got me thinking. A "no-thank-you helping" is something I was forced to eat as a child: one serving spoon's worth of whatever it was I'd just declined (politely or not). I'm assuming my mother learned the term from her mother or grandmother (though she might have coined it herself, and obviously the Beaner got it from both of us), but the Beaner is right that the concept has been around at least as long as Green Eggs and Ham&#8212;and probably longer.
</p>

<p>
Did you have to eat no-thank-you helpings as a kid? If so, did your mom or grandmom call them that, or something else?
</p>
