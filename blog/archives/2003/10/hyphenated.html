<h3 class="title">Hyphenated</h3>

<p>
My name is Lori Hylan-Cho. I answer to Lori Hylan, because that's who I've always been, and even to Mrs. Cho, if I'm checking into a hotel under a reservation my husband has made, but my legal name is Lori Hylan-Cho. It's the name that's listed on my driver's license, my passport, and my Social Security card. It's the name I invented for myself a few hours after my wedding, when I decided that I wanted to both remain a Hylan and become a Cho.
</p>

<p>
I used to think hyphenating was kinda silly, until I was faced with a name-change decision myself. Up until the wedding day, I was planning to stay Lori Hylan. There really is something special and spiritual and life-changing about getting married, however, and after going through the whole experience, I found I really wanted to be Hylan-Cho, not just Hylan (and not just Cho).
</p>

<p>
Of course, I did not invent hyphenated names: They've been in vogue for YEARS. This is why I find it so appalling that so many databases, web forms, and humans can't handle them. 
</p>

<p>
All my airline tickets read LORI HYLANCHO. So do most of the hotel reservations I make over the web. (One attempt to foil the space-and-hyphen-eating Last Name field resulted in a reservation for Lorihylan Cho.) This is mostly just annoying, but it's often inconvenient as well. The new self-check-in terminals that airlines practically force you to use don't recognize the name on my credit card, LORI HYLAN-CHO, as being the same as the one they have in their reservation system, LORI HYLANCHO, so I have to know (and type in) my ticket number in order to get a boarding pass.
</p>

<p>
Most web forms merely butcher my name after I click Submit, but I recently ran into a form validation script that wouldn't accept my legal name. It was on the TiVo website, where I'd gone to order a replacement remote (our TiVo arrived with the car, but the remote went into storage). The weirdest thing about it is that it accepted Hylan-Cho as a valid last name for shipping, but it declared it INVALID for billing. The name that's *actually on my credit card* was invalid for billing!
</p>

<p>
As galling as some of the computer rejections and modifications have been, the human butcherings are usually worse. As we traveled on our honeymoon road trip, I'd call ahead to hotels to make reservations, giving my newly-minted name each time: "H, Y, L, A, N, hyphen, C, H, O". Upon arrival, I'd find that I'd been registered as Lori Hylan/Cho, Lori Hylan'Jo (my favorite), or Lori Hylan,Cho. I had no idea that so few people knew what a hyphen was.
</p>

<p>
The latest and most maddening misnomer, however, came with the loan documents for our new house: I'd been renamed by our mortgage broker to Lori H. Cho. MY NAME IS <b>NOT</b> LORI H. CHO. My middle initial is M, and always will be. Some women, when they marry, take their husbands' names and use their maiden names as their middle names. I think it's a great solution for some people, especially when the woman wants to preserve her name, but when one or both names are too long for hyphenation. It's also great for people who want to avoid the hyphenation horrors I've encountered and still use both names. But for me, the hypenation was intentional and desirable.
</p>

<p>
As I crossed out H. Cho, wrote in Hylan-Cho, and signed Lori Hylan-Cho on line after line and page after page of the loan documents, I got more and more angry. Lori H. Cho DOESN'T EXIST. I'm not sure why I reacted more strongly to this butchering than to others (which have included Laurie Hyland and Lon Highland along with the aforementioned Lori Hylancho and Lori Hylan'Jo). Perhaps because this wasn't just a ridiculous&#8212;and temporary&#8212;hotel reservation ("allo, is this missus 'jo?"), but a legal contract. If it isn't fixed, my name will be wrong on the deed to the house.
</p>

<p>
It also seems like a slap in the face, a sign of disrespect with a hint of sexism. I gave a lot of thought to what my name would be after I was married, and took pains to change it on all my legal documents. Either my maiden name or my married name was on EVERY SINGLE SUPPORTING DOCUMENT we gave the mortgage broker; not ONCE was it listed anywhere as Lori H. Cho. So why would he assume that Lori H. Cho was my name? Had he really never encountered a hyphenated name before? Did he really think that I couldn't bind my husband's name to my own, that I had to assume my husband's name alone and relegate mine to a middle-initial memory? Was the person who typed up the forms just lazy?
</p>

<p>
I don't know. All I know is I'm not Lori H. Cho.

<p>I'm always suprised at the amount of sexism that still exists. My wife and I are partners, full and in every way. My wife would probably object, but I definitely consider her to be the more intelligent of the two of us. So when a clerk or server turns to me to make the decisions, I have to laugh. I feel like saying, "You don't have any idea how much of an idiot I can be do you. Can't you tell she's the smart one," after all, to me it's obvious.</p>

<p>So yeah, you're being dissed, but only by people that aren't thinking for themselves and just living out the social mores of a backwardly patriarical society.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of hyphenation. I inherited my last name from my parents, so I've always been hyphenated. I keep wondering what I'm supposed to do if I get married. Just tack another one on? </p>

<p>Anyway, I used to get really upset about people misspelling my name, but I've just given up. No one has EVER gotten it correct on the first try. "No, my first name has no 'e' on the end. No, only one 'l'. No, no 'a'. No, no 't'. No, the last one starts with an 'h', not an 'o'. 'ch', not 'sh'. No, a hyphen is like a dash." After several years, I just sort of nod politely and go with whatever they want. The only time I correct it is on legal documents.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure other people really think all that much about how they render other peoples' names, particularly if it's their job to fill out one form after another. I'm sure it all just becomes a blur to them after awhile.</p>

<p>hey, hoche! I'd forgotten you were also hyphenated -- and that you've had to deal with it your whole life. maybe if you get married you can take your wife's name... or, as a former co-worker and his wife did, make up an entirely new name for both of you (they chose Wolf). in any case, your comments helped put things in perspective. after all, I *chose* hyphenation hell. &lt;sigh&gt;</p>

<p>My wife and I both "hyphenated" when we got married. The social security office worked like clockwork, ditto at the passport agency, ditto at the DMV.</p>

<p>What is still wrong with all the airlines and other people who can't figure it out? My response has been to refuse to do business with online retailers unless they can accept my legal name (and believe me I let them know why I am choosing other services!).</p>

<p>That is so cool, Sam. I asked my husband if he wanted to hyphenate (while I was trying to decide what to do with my own name), but we couldn't come up with a combination that suited him. Since he was primarily Cho, Hylan-Cho didn't seem right. And Cho-Hylan didn't *sound* right. So he stayed Cho.</p>

<p>FWIW, I had the same experience with the SSA, the passport agency, and the DMV -- they didn't even blink. You'd think that if the government can get its act together, private industry ought to be able to as well...</p>
