<h3 class="title">Hyphenated</h3>

<p>
My name is Lori Hylan-Cho. I answer to Lori Hylan, because that's who I've always been, and even to Mrs. Cho, if I'm checking into a hotel under a reservation my husband has made, but my legal name is Lori Hylan-Cho. It's the name that's listed on my driver's license, my passport, and my Social Security card. It's the name I invented for myself a few hours after my wedding, when I decided that I wanted to both remain a Hylan and become a Cho.
</p>

<p>
I used to think hyphenating was kinda silly, until I was faced with a name-change decision myself. Up until the wedding day, I was planning to stay Lori Hylan. There really is something special and spiritual and life-changing about getting married, however, and after going through the whole experience, I found I really wanted to be Hylan-Cho, not just Hylan (and not just Cho).
</p>

<p>
Of course, I did not invent hyphenated names: They've been in vogue for YEARS. This is why I find it so appalling that so many databases, web forms, and humans can't handle them. 
</p>

<p>
All my airline tickets read LORI HYLANCHO. So do most of the hotel reservations I make over the web. (One attempt to foil the space-and-hyphen-eating Last Name field resulted in a reservation for Lorihylan Cho.) This is mostly just annoying, but it's often inconvenient as well. The new self-check-in terminals that airlines practically force you to use don't recognize the name on my credit card, LORI HYLAN-CHO, as being the same as the one they have in their reservation system, LORI HYLANCHO, so I have to know (and type in) my ticket number in order to get a boarding pass.
</p>

<p>
Most web forms merely butcher my name after I click Submit, but I recently ran into a form validation script that wouldn't accept my legal name. It was on the TiVo website, where I'd gone to order a replacement remote (our TiVo arrived with the car, but the remote went into storage). The weirdest thing about it is that it accepted Hylan-Cho as a valid last name for shipping, but it declared it INVALID for billing. The name that's *actually on my credit card* was invalid for billing!
</p>

<p>
As galling as some of the computer rejections and modifications have been, the human butcherings are usually worse. As we traveled on our honeymoon road trip, I'd call ahead to hotels to make reservations, giving my newly-minted name each time: "H, Y, L, A, N, hyphen, C, H, O". Upon arrival, I'd find that I'd been registered as Lori Hylan/Cho, Lori Hylan'Jo (my favorite), or Lori Hylan,Cho. I had no idea that so few people knew what a hyphen was.
</p>

<p>
The latest and most maddening misnomer, however, came with the loan documents for our new house: I'd been renamed by our mortgage broker to Lori H. Cho. MY NAME IS <b>NOT</b> LORI H. CHO. My middle initial is M, and always will be. Some women, when they marry, take their husbands' names and use their maiden names as their middle names. I think it's a great solution for some people, especially when the woman wants to preserve her name, but when one or both names are too long for hyphenation. It's also great for people who want to avoid the hyphenation horrors I've encountered and still use both names. But for me, the hypenation was intentional and desirable.
</p>

<p>
As I crossed out H. Cho, wrote in Hylan-Cho, and signed Lori Hylan-Cho on line after line and page after page of the loan documents, I got more and more angry. Lori H. Cho DOESN'T EXIST. I'm not sure why I reacted more strongly to this butchering than to others (which have included Laurie Hyland and Lon Highland along with the aforementioned Lori Hylancho and Lori Hylan'Jo). Perhaps because this wasn't just a ridiculous&#8212;and temporary&#8212;hotel reservation ("allo, is this missus 'jo?"), but a legal contract. If it isn't fixed, my name will be wrong on the deed to the house.
</p>

<p>
It also seems like a slap in the face, a sign of disrespect with a hint of sexism. I gave a lot of thought to what my name would be after I was married, and took pains to change it on all my legal documents. Either my maiden name or my married name was on EVERY SINGLE SUPPORTING DOCUMENT we gave the mortgage broker; not ONCE was it listed anywhere as Lori H. Cho. So why would he assume that Lori H. Cho was my name? Had he really never encountered a hyphenated name before? Did he really think that I couldn't bind my husband's name to my own, that I had to assume my husband's name alone and relegate mine to a middle-initial memory? Was the person who typed up the forms just lazy?
</p>

<p>
I don't know. All I know is I'm not Lori H. Cho.

<h3 class="title">Think Yuck</h3>

<p>
A few weeks ago, when I was walking down JFK Blvd. toward Love Plaza, I noticed that the water in the fountain there was pink. I chalked it up to a bizarre prank. Then, a few nights later, Al and I noticed as we drove south on Broad Street toward City Hall that a few of the downtown buildings were lit with pink spotlights. "What's with the pink?" Al asked. I shrugged, and mentioned the fountain.
</p>

<p>
The following week I was walking around town with my sister-in-law, and I saw that the fountain in Love Plaza&#8212;and several others&#8212;were still filled with pink water. Suddenly, it dawned on me: October is "Breast Cancer Awareness Month", and as we all know, breast cancer is PINK. 
</p>

<p>
I'm obviously being sarcastic here. The color I most associate with breast cancer is not pink, but yellow. It's the color my close friend and former roommate of 5 years, Pat Serino, turned when breast cancer spread to her liver, giving her a bad case of jaundice. Before that, she was an alabaster gray, as chemo drained her energy&#8212;and her stomach. I can't remember a single moment when she was pink. I can remember the angry red of a breast swollen with what doctors said was just a "systemic infection" a few months before she was diagnosed with cancer, and the purplish red of radiation burns between bouts of chemo, but she was never pink.
</p>

<p>
I'm glad that people are now more aware of breast cancer, and I don't deny that my awareness was a little lacking before Pat was diagnosed. But is dyeing fountains pink raising awareness? Is shopping for a cure really buying anything more than increased profits and brand awareness for BMW, American Express, Yoplait, and all the other companies with breast cancer campaigns? I can't help but think that associating pink and shopping with breast cancer is just a way to make breast cancer seem warm and fuzzy and feminine. Let me tell you, it's none of the above. Breast cancer, believe it or not, strikes men as well as women. Breast cancer is an ugly, disfiguring disease. Breast cancer KILLS. It killed Pat, it killed my family's dear friend Loretta Mercurio, and it's killed countless others. It's not pink, and no amount of shopping is going to make it go away.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Big Birthday</h3>

<p>
I turned 35 this weekend. I am now what people used to consider "middle aged," though I believe that mark has moved to 45 or 50. I am now at the point where a pregnancy would be considered "high risk". I am now 10 years older than my dad was when I was born. And I feel GREAT. I am relatively healthy, I am meeting my financial obligations, and I am a hell of lot wiser than I was at 25... and yet in many ways I am still living the life of someone in her twenties.
</p>

<p>
It's ironic that a kid who was so grown up at 5, 10, and 15 that she used to scare parents and teachers would have such a delayed adulthood, but that has pretty much turned out to be the case for me. It's not that I delayed marriage and family for the sake of my career; it's that I haven't had marriage and family on my to-do list at all since I turned 18. I was willing (and excited!) to live my whole life as a single woman, with none of the markers people associate with adulthood except a few wrinkles.  I saw no reason to give up jeans and baseball caps and Sketchers and Doc Martens just because I turned 25 or 30 or 35. Spending almost 10 years in the web and web-software worlds abetted that scheme, of course&#8212; I've worn jeans and t-shirts to work since 1995&#8212;but I'd declared myself a Dyes 'R Us kid even before that, when I worked at the World Bank. My years at Macromedia just never forced me to give up anything except my (admittedly barely-) business suits.
</p>

<p>
To my great surprise, I fell in love at 33 and got married a couple weeks before my 34th birthday, but even marriage hasn't really forced me to grow up. My husband and I have had great fun running around like kids, playing hockey, traveling around the country, and moving at will without regard to school districts. Sure, I don't go out to clubs and parties like I used to, and I pretty much stopped drinking when I experienced my first real hangovers around age 31 or 32,  and yes, the kids will spot me as a geezer by the faint wrinkles and the requests to turn the music down, but by virtue of the fact that I am doing whatever I want whenever I want to, I feel like a kid.
</p>

<p>
Actually, now that I think about it... doing whatever I wanted whenever I wanted to was *not* a hallmark of my childhood (or even of my early twenties). This freedom is something new, perhaps something uniquely identified with my thirites. I remember my roommate Pat saying that her thirties were her favorite years, though 42 felt pretty darn good, too. (That was before the cancer diagnosis.) I can totally see why: financial freedom, personal freedom, experience enough to make smart choices (and the emotional maturity to recover faster from poor ones), and a body that's still in relatively good shape. (OK, my thyroid's a bit out of whack, and I have a couple other chronic conditions, but I'm fit and functional and in better shape than I was at 20.)
</p>

<p>
I don't feel old, I feel equipped. Ready for new adventures, to take on the world on my own terms, to defend my choices and my changes of mind. Maybe I haven't postponed adulthood after all&#8212;I've just experienced it differently than most. I've gotten to do it my way. How lucky am I for that?
</p>
