<h3 class="title">From Austen to Disco</h3>

<p>
I've been on a bit of a Jane Austen binge lately. I re-read my three favorites, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553213105/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Pride and Prejudice</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679409874/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Sense and Sensibility</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067940581X/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Emma</a>, and now I've moved on to the never-before-read Northanger Abbey. I probably should have re-read Persuasion or picked up a new Jane Austen mystery instead; either would have been a bit less dull. Northanger Abbey is short, however, and probably easily finished. And today I've been watching the movie versions of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000G3AZ/" target="a8_win">Emma</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005MP58/" target="a8_win">Pride and Prejudice</a> (and I'm considering renting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0800141660/" target="a8_win">Sense and Sensibility</a>) while I pack to cheer me.
</p>

<p>
The book I most want to read next is a huge departure from the world of Jane Austen: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857642/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Disco Bloodbath</a>, by James St. James. After searching book stores in vain and being told that it was out of print, I learned today that it's been re-published under the title <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743259823/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Party Monster</a>, to coincide with the release of the film of the same name (which itself is based on Disco Bloodbath). Whew! I knew that the media conglomerates wouldn't let such a golden co-marketing opportunity escape them, which is why it was so puzzling that Disco Bloodbath could be out of print.
</p>

<p>
So why do I want to read this book? Because I saw the movie last week with my friend Kristin, and I want to know more about the people involved. We saw the film at the fabulous Castro theater in San Francisco; knowing very little about the movie ahead of time&#8212;only that it was about NY club kids in the late 80s, and that it was Macaulay Culkin's first film in years&#8212;Kristin and I were amused to find that we seemed to be out on Date Night in the Castro. About 10 minutes in, we realized that we couldn't have seen the movie in a more perfect setting, with a more perfect crowd: It was as much about drag queens, gender-bending, and elaborate costumes as it was about parties and drugs.
</p>

<p>
Macaulay Culkin's performance, as Kristin put it, "was so 10th-grade play", but Seth Green, as the aforementioned St. James, was hysterical and wonderful. He's so often cast as a wise-cracking geek (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305428115/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Enemy of the State</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000B1OFL/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">The Italian Job</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/series/-/6/dvd/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Austen Powers series</a>) that you don't really get to appreciate his range&#8212;but believe me, he's got one, and it's on display here. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/16/arts/16JAME.html?th" target="a8_win">According to the New York Times</a> the movie will get wider release in October, but I imagine it'll still only be in small theaters. See it surrounded by drag queens, if you can.
