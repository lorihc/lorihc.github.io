<h3 class="title">Light and Unsweet</h3>

<p>
So I walked into a Dunkin' Donuts this morning (my first DD trip in Philadelphia) and ordered a small decaf coffee, light. What I got was something so horrible, so undrinkable, that I began to wonder whether "coffee, light" means something different in Philly than it does anywhere else. It appears to mean the equivalent of "coffee, regular", which in New York (and, I thought, the entire northeast) means "cream, two sugars". I was under the impression that "coffee, light" meant "just cream".
</p>

<p>
If anyone knows of a "how to order coffee in various cities and actually get what you want" guide on the web, please point me to it. In the meantime, I will be ordering "decaf, milk, no sugar" just to be safe. Or perhaps, to be safer, "decaf, black".
</p>

<p>The secret is, don't even use the word 'sugar' at all when you order.  Otherwise when you complain they'll say you used the word 'sugar.'</p>

<p>What works best is, "milk only." </p>

<p>Coffee Regular is usually, yes, two sugars light.</p>

<p>Hello, Clemmie! So happy to see you!</p>

<p>Yeah, I was worried that mentioning "sugar" at all would result in the icky sweet concoction I got this morning, even if there was a "no" in front of it. "Milk only" sounds like a good plan!</p>
