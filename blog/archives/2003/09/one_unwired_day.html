<h3 class="title">One Unwired Day</h3>

<p>
I totally forgot that today was a free wireless day at T-Mobile hotspots around the country, so I signed off after my usual hour this morning. I'll have to go back down to Borders to post this&#8212;and then spend the afternoon surfing the web. :)
</p> 
<p>
I was going to write about how I was a bit sad that my scrapbooking materials weren't here yet, because if they were, I'd spend the day scrapbooking. &quot;Even though it's a nice day out?&quot; said Al when I mentioned it to him. Yes, it's true I don't like to waste nice days in Philadelphia (they're scarcer than in Mountain View), but I've done a LOT of exploring on foot over the past three days, and it would be nice to have a day to sit still and work on projects. Given that it's a free wireless day, however, I suppose I should be glad that my materials won't arrive until tomorrow. There's nothing to stop me now from spending all day online. Bwahahahaha! (Well, lack of battery power might; I don't like to drag around the heavy A/C pack.) 
</p> 
<p>
Before I realized it was free wireless day, I was thinking about going down to the park I found at 3rd and Chestnut and sitting on a bench to read. I might still do that, actually. I can always duck into the Starbucks when the predicted afternoon rain arrives. I wish I could check ahead of time whether the Starbucks on 3rd has wireless... but of course I'm not online now. It really is difficult to live without both Internet access and a phone book (the apartment has neither). Al and I use the web to look up everything; only when a business doesn't seem to have a site and Bigbook and Google searches have failed us do we resort to the phone book. I was talking to my mom on the phone the other day, and she said, &quot;did you get my e-mail about X?&quot; I said, &quot;oh, I only get to check e-mail once a day now (if I'm lucky), because I have to go down to the Borders to do it. I won't be able to respond until tomorrow, sorry.&quot; She replied, &quot;Don't be sorry! This is how most people deal with e-mail: they check once a day or once every other day.&quot; You mean other people don't check mail every 5 minutes, and respond every hour or so? Really? Huh.
