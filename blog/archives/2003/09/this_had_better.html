<h3 class="title">This Had Better Be (Fat) Free</h3>

<p>
I checked online, and sure enough, the Starbucks at which I am sitting (at 1201 Market Street in Philadelphia) is participating in <a href="http://www.intel.com/unwire/" target="a8_win">One Unwired Day</a>. I can't find any catches or caveats, so theoretically all this wonderful, glorious Internet time&#8212;which I have been spending chatting with my former boss and my husband, reading the New York Times online, and catching up with some of my favorite blogs&#8212;has been wonderfully, gloriously free.
</p>

<p>
Lest you think that I have chosen the hermetically-sealed, air-conditioned environs of this Starbucks over the sunny, breezy day on offer outside, I did spend at least an hour reading (and trying to keep from dozing off) in the park at 3rd and Chestnut. If I'd only had a blanket to stretch out on in the grass, I would have stayed longer. I also walked around Old City and enjoyed the most delicious fat-free soft-serve chocolate ice cream cone I've ever had (from <a href="http://cremalita.com/index.html" target="a8_win">CremaLita</a> on Chestnut; apparently the shop just opened today). It didn't taste fat-free at all. How did they do that?
