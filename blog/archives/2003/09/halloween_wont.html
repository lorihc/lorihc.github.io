<h3 class="title">Halloween Won't Be the Same This Year</h3>

<p>
I am very excited that we've finally <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/archives/000257.html#000257">found a house</a> in Philly, but I'm a bit bummed that we won't be moving in until late November or December. Why? Because we won't have a place to decorate for Halloween, of course! 
</p>

<p>
I've set aside our orange napkins with the black cats on them so that we can celebrate Halloween inside the apartment, but there won't be much to make the exterior very scary. I imagine we'll get a few trick-or-treaters anyway, since the Ben Franklin House is a huge apartment building, but there will be nowhere to put our tombstones or to display our blacklight.
</p>

<p>
Now that I think of it, it'll probably be a bit hard to decorate our new house next year, too&#8212;since it's a city townhouse, it has no yard in which to hang all our scary stuff. There's a little garden area next to the front steps, though, which might make a good spot for our tombstones. Might look very <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/waltdisneyworld/parksandmore/attractions/attractionindex?id=MKTheHauntedMansionAtt" target="a8_win">Haunted Mansion</a>. We could probably put the black light behind the glass block that backs the little garden, too... oooh, that would give the tombstones an eerie glow!
</p>

<p>
See how I relish this stuff? Halloween is my favorite holiday (followed closely by Christmas and Valentine's Day), and for the past two years&#8212;the first that I've had a house from which to hand out candy&#8212;I've kept an <a href="/halloween/">all hallows eve blog</a> to chronicle our visitors and their candy choices. I don't know if it'll be worthwhile to do it again this year, since I'll have no windows through which to observe the kids' approach and to inspect their costumes. Maybe we'll invest in a baby gate (to keep Annie inside) and prop the apartment door open. That way, we'll be able to decorate the inside and give the kids something to look at while we admire their costumes. Hmm, that really could work... maybe I should set aside the Halloween decorations before the packers come tomorrow morning!
