<h3 class="title">A New Life</h3>

<p>
We put an offer on a house in Philadelphia today. I don't want to say much about it here yet, for fear of jinxing it, but we're very excited.
</p>

<p>
I'm really glad I came out for this little house-hunting trip prior to the move (especially as it ended in us making an offer), but now that I'm here, I wish I could stay. I know that there's a bunch of stuff yet to be done in California, and Annie to retrieve, but I was just starting to get used to the idea of living in Philly. At first it felt like some weird vacation, but now I get it: this is home.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, I am eager to return to California because I miss Annie terribly and am nervous that *she* is nervous. She didn't seem to cope well at all with my last week at work, which involved me leaving the house between 8 and 9 each morning and not returning until between 10pm and 1am, and now I've abandoned her again. I have a feeling she's not going to be too excited about me returning to take her to the vet on Monday, and then on a scary plane ride on Saturday... Hopefully she'll be able to adapt to the apartment, and then again to the new house (which, if we get it, we'll probably move into in November).
</p>

<p>
It is with these mixed emotions&#8212;joy, excitement, worry, confusion&#8212;sore feet, and a strong desire for sleep that I box up my old life and unpack my new one. I hope it all works out.
</p>

<h3 class="title">From Austen to Disco</h3>

<p>
I've been on a bit of a Jane Austen binge lately. I re-read my three favorites, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553213105/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Pride and Prejudice</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679409874/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Sense and Sensibility</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067940581X/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Emma</a>, and now I've moved on to the never-before-read Northanger Abbey. I probably should have re-read Persuasion or picked up a new Jane Austen mystery instead; either would have been a bit less dull. Northanger Abbey is short, however, and probably easily finished. And today I've been watching the movie versions of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000G3AZ/" target="a8_win">Emma</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005MP58/" target="a8_win">Pride and Prejudice</a> (and I'm considering renting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0800141660/" target="a8_win">Sense and Sensibility</a>) while I pack to cheer me.
</p>

<p>
The book I most want to read next is a huge departure from the world of Jane Austen: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857642/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Disco Bloodbath</a>, by James St. James. After searching book stores in vain and being told that it was out of print, I learned today that it's been re-published under the title <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743259823/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Party Monster</a>, to coincide with the release of the film of the same name (which itself is based on Disco Bloodbath). Whew! I knew that the media conglomerates wouldn't let such a golden co-marketing opportunity escape them, which is why it was so puzzling that Disco Bloodbath could be out of print.
</p>

<p>
So why do I want to read this book? Because I saw the movie last week with my friend Kristin, and I want to know more about the people involved. We saw the film at the fabulous Castro theater in San Francisco; knowing very little about the movie ahead of time&#8212;only that it was about NY club kids in the late 80s, and that it was Macaulay Culkin's first film in years&#8212;Kristin and I were amused to find that we seemed to be out on Date Night in the Castro. About 10 minutes in, we realized that we couldn't have seen the movie in a more perfect setting, with a more perfect crowd: It was as much about drag queens, gender-bending, and elaborate costumes as it was about parties and drugs.
</p>

<p>
Macaulay Culkin's performance, as Kristin put it, "was so 10th-grade play", but Seth Green, as the aforementioned St. James, was hysterical and wonderful. He's so often cast as a wise-cracking geek (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305428115/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Enemy of the State</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000B1OFL/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">The Italian Job</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/series/-/6/dvd/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Austen Powers series</a>) that you don't really get to appreciate his range&#8212;but believe me, he's got one, and it's on display here. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/16/arts/16JAME.html?th" target="a8_win">According to the New York Times</a> the movie will get wider release in October, but I imagine it'll still only be in small theaters. See it surrounded by drag queens, if you can.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Halloween Won't Be the Same This Year</h3>

<p>
I am very excited that we've finally <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/archives/000257.html#000257">found a house</a> in Philly, but I'm a bit bummed that we won't be moving in until late November or December. Why? Because we won't have a place to decorate for Halloween, of course! 
</p>

<p>
I've set aside our orange napkins with the black cats on them so that we can celebrate Halloween inside the apartment, but there won't be much to make the exterior very scary. I imagine we'll get a few trick-or-treaters anyway, since the Ben Franklin House is a huge apartment building, but there will be nowhere to put our tombstones or to display our blacklight.
</p>

<p>
Now that I think of it, it'll probably be a bit hard to decorate our new house next year, too&#8212;since it's a city townhouse, it has no yard in which to hang all our scary stuff. There's a little garden area next to the front steps, though, which might make a good spot for our tombstones. Might look very <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/waltdisneyworld/parksandmore/attractions/attractionindex?id=MKTheHauntedMansionAtt" target="a8_win">Haunted Mansion</a>. We could probably put the black light behind the glass block that backs the little garden, too... oooh, that would give the tombstones an eerie glow!
</p>

<p>
See how I relish this stuff? Halloween is my favorite holiday (followed closely by Christmas and Valentine's Day), and for the past two years&#8212;the first that I've had a house from which to hand out candy&#8212;I've kept an <a href="/halloween/">all hallows eve blog</a> to chronicle our visitors and their candy choices. I don't know if it'll be worthwhile to do it again this year, since I'll have no windows through which to observe the kids' approach and to inspect their costumes. Maybe we'll invest in a baby gate (to keep Annie inside) and prop the apartment door open. That way, we'll be able to decorate the inside and give the kids something to look at while we admire their costumes. Hmm, that really could work... maybe I should set aside the Halloween decorations before the packers come tomorrow morning!
</p>

<p>
It's moving day, and I'm sick. After an abominable allergy attack yesterday&#8212;brought on, most likely, by (a) being in the same room with Annie for most of the day without a HEPA filter, (b) every bit of dust and dander in the house being released and circulated by the packing activities, and (c) the allergy shot I got at 2pm (what was I thinking?)&#8212;my sinuses, ears, and throat are all congested and sore, and all I want to do is sleep and drink mint tea.
</p>

<p>
No rest for the wicked today, though, as the movers will be here shortly to load the truck, and I need to head out to return the cable modem (bwaaah! no more always-on internet!). I also need to finish arranging my suitcases so something I need doesn't accidentally end up on the truck. Farewell for a couple days. Wish us luck getting all our stuff and Annie across the country!

<h3 class="title">Hello Youse Guys!</h3>

<p>
Greetings from the Borders at Chestnut and Broad in Philadelphia, where I've stopped to check e-mail and upload a couple <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town_II/">about town II</a> photos. (Speaking of photos, one of my photos of some interesting urban textures I noticed at the San Carlos Caltrain station was posted on <a href="http://www.credodesigninc.com/lalaland/index.cgi?date=20030920" target="a8_win">Lalaland</a> on Saturday. Fitting, as it was our last day in California!)
</p>

<p>
Al, Annie, and I all survived the move intact, though for Annie especially it was a bit stressful. She'd never been on a plane before, so there were all kinds of crazy new noises to contend with... not to mention the extra security screening she and I were subjected to at SFO. They actually needed to *manually search Annie*, even though I'd carried her through the metal detector. What did they think, that I'd strapped plastic explosives to her belly? (Of course I didn't say that to the inspector, or I would have been led away in cuffs I'm sure.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, Annie seems to have adapted to the apartment quite well, and I'm just starting to develop a routine. (Well, I'll wait until the end of the week to determine how "routine" it is.) So far I've got more things to do than I can fit in a day. How did I ever find time to work before?
</p>

<h3 class="title">Light and Unsweet</h3>

<p>
So I walked into a Dunkin' Donuts this morning (my first DD trip in Philadelphia) and ordered a small decaf coffee, light. What I got was something so horrible, so undrinkable, that I began to wonder whether "coffee, light" means something different in Philly than it does anywhere else. It appears to mean the equivalent of "coffee, regular", which in New York (and, I thought, the entire northeast) means "cream, two sugars". I was under the impression that "coffee, light" meant "just cream".
</p>

<p>
If anyone knows of a "how to order coffee in various cities and actually get what you want" guide on the web, please point me to it. In the meantime, I will be ordering "decaf, milk, no sugar" just to be safe. Or perhaps, to be safer, "decaf, black".
</p>

<h3 class="title">One Unwired Day</h3>

<p>
I totally forgot that today was a free wireless day at T-Mobile hotspots around the country, so I signed off after my usual hour this morning. I'll have to go back down to Borders to post this&#8212;and then spend the afternoon surfing the web. :)
</p> 
<p>
I was going to write about how I was a bit sad that my scrapbooking materials weren't here yet, because if they were, I'd spend the day scrapbooking. &quot;Even though it's a nice day out?&quot; said Al when I mentioned it to him. Yes, it's true I don't like to waste nice days in Philadelphia (they're scarcer than in Mountain View), but I've done a LOT of exploring on foot over the past three days, and it would be nice to have a day to sit still and work on projects. Given that it's a free wireless day, however, I suppose I should be glad that my materials won't arrive until tomorrow. There's nothing to stop me now from spending all day online. Bwahahahaha! (Well, lack of battery power might; I don't like to drag around the heavy A/C pack.) 
</p> 
<p>
Before I realized it was free wireless day, I was thinking about going down to the park I found at 3rd and Chestnut and sitting on a bench to read. I might still do that, actually. I can always duck into the Starbucks when the predicted afternoon rain arrives. I wish I could check ahead of time whether the Starbucks on 3rd has wireless... but of course I'm not online now. It really is difficult to live without both Internet access and a phone book (the apartment has neither). Al and I use the web to look up everything; only when a business doesn't seem to have a site and Bigbook and Google searches have failed us do we resort to the phone book. I was talking to my mom on the phone the other day, and she said, &quot;did you get my e-mail about X?&quot; I said, &quot;oh, I only get to check e-mail once a day now (if I'm lucky), because I have to go down to the Borders to do it. I won't be able to respond until tomorrow, sorry.&quot; She replied, &quot;Don't be sorry! This is how most people deal with e-mail: they check once a day or once every other day.&quot; You mean other people don't check mail every 5 minutes, and respond every hour or so? Really? Huh.
</p>

<h3 class="title">This Had Better Be (Fat) Free</h3>

<p>
I checked online, and sure enough, the Starbucks at which I am sitting (at 1201 Market Street in Philadelphia) is participating in <a href="http://www.intel.com/unwire/" target="a8_win">One Unwired Day</a>. I can't find any catches or caveats, so theoretically all this wonderful, glorious Internet time&#8212;which I have been spending chatting with my former boss and my husband, reading the New York Times online, and catching up with some of my favorite blogs&#8212;has been wonderfully, gloriously free.
</p>

<p>
Lest you think that I have chosen the hermetically-sealed, air-conditioned environs of this Starbucks over the sunny, breezy day on offer outside, I did spend at least an hour reading (and trying to keep from dozing off) in the park at 3rd and Chestnut. If I'd only had a blanket to stretch out on in the grass, I would have stayed longer. I also walked around Old City and enjoyed the most delicious fat-free soft-serve chocolate ice cream cone I've ever had (from <a href="http://cremalita.com/index.html" target="a8_win">CremaLita</a> on Chestnut; apparently the shop just opened today). It didn't taste fat-free at all. How did they do that?

<h3 class="title">It's in the Jeans</h3>

<p>
Meg has <a href="http://www.megnut.com/new_york/007439.asp" target="a8_win">a funny post about jeans</a> on her site this week. Reading it made me wince, as I'm sure I would receive a citation for the slightly-too-long, slightly-too-baggy, not-particularly-flattering-to-the-female-form Caslon stretch denims that I'm wearing right now, but boy are they comfortable. And as I look out the window at the working public of Philadelphia passing by, in their heels and loafers and suits and skirts, I'm thankful that I have the luxury of wearing Sketchers and jeans at all, no matter how ill-fitting. Meg's final point is a good one, though&#8212;one that made me want to join her Jeans Police:
</p>

<blockquote>
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women are not shaped equal, and each is entitled to a great pair of jeans!
</blockquote>

<p>
As I write this I am reminded of an ill-fated marketing concept Levi's tried years ago: cut-to-fit jeans. I ordered a pair, and while they did indeed fit me right out of the mailer (unlike any other pair of Levi's I've ever tried on), they weren't exactly what I'd call flattering. (They also didn't fit for more than a couple weeks, because the horror of having to buy expensive, unflattering cut-to-fit jeans&#8212;and worse, to have to endure a tape-measuring by a mall salesgirl&#8212;gave me the incentive I needed to go on a diet.) 
</p>

<p>
I'm also reminded of a recent headline on the cover of <em>Us</em> or <em>People</em> or one of those other celebrity/style magazines you find at supermarket checkout stands that screamed "Jeans for Every Figure!". Upon looking inside, I found that by "every figure," they meant "every figure *in Hollywood*". Granted, Hollywood has body types of every persuasion, including stomach gainers with long legs, curvy hourglass vixens, apples, and pears, but generally they're all at or below ideal weight. (Certainly all the celebrity/actress/model types that were pictured in the article were.) Yes, it's true, certain styles and brands of jeans will look better on some body types than others, but just about any brand is guaranteed to look good on a stick.
</p>

<p>
And now that I'm thinking of jeans and magazines, some terrible fashion advice from <em>Teen</em> magazine (is that still around?), circa 1979, comes to mind: "If you have a large rear-end, wear jeans with smaller pockets to de-emphasize it." DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TAKE THIS ADVICE.  Everyone sees the pockets, notices that they look smaller, and assumes that it's not the pockets that are smaller, it's your butt that's bigger. That's right, smaller-than-normal pockets make your butt look BIGGER, not smaller. Get the biggest damn pockets you can find, by all means. And broader shoulders, if you can. (More valuable than either of those: an honest friend to go shopping with you.)
</p>

<p>
And finally, a jean quote from the movie Party Girl (funny how many jeans-related items I have filed away!):
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Mary</b> [to Derrick, who's going through her clothes rack]<b>: </b> "Don't mess those up, they're in order."<br />
<b>Derrick: </b> "Mary, they're <em>jeans</em>."<br />
<b>Mary: </b> "Yes, Derrick, they're <em>jeans</em>. And they're in <em>order</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
I have about 20 pairs of jeans. At least. Some in a box labeled "size 8s and 10s" that I hope to be able to wear again some day, some (size 10 and 12) hanging <em>in order</em> in my closet currently, and some (size 12 and 14) that are in the back of my closet (or rather were; now they are in moving boxes along with the rest of the clothes that are not in active rotation), just in case I go on a donut binge or get pregnant and need to leave the house. Some I really should throw out, because they aren't flattering anymore (or never were; a few random pairs purchased without a try-on at Costco fall into this category), and some I really should try to buy in another wash or color, they look so good. (Unfortunately, that never really works; I have yet to have two pairs of jeans, even when of the same style, size, and manufacturer, fit exactly the same.)
</p>

<p>
I've struggled with this, but I find that I am unable to stop myself from sharing with you my imagined slogan for the next great jean company I hope will come along:
</p>

<blockquote>
The perfect jeans for those of us without perfect genes.
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, I really am that corny.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Get Out Your Sweaters!</h3>

<p>
In between all the football games and season premiers yesterday, the local news affliates kept telling us that the temperatures would be dropping. "It's time to get out your sweaters, folks! Details at 11!" I purposely watched the 11 o'clock news to find out just HOW COLD it was going to get. I, for one, have been dying for fall to get here. Finally, here was some news of its arrival. Sweater weather! Yippee!
</p>

<p>
So how cold is cold to the Philadelphia weather folks? Around 11:18pm last night, I found out. It's... 65 degrees fahrenheit. (And on Thursday, we're going to get all the way down to 62!) I was so disappointed. 65 is a WARM day in San Francisco. "You might want to dress in layers," said our weather woman. Lady, layers have been my LIFE these last 7 years. I come from the land of microclimates, the place where the evening news reports highs of "60s at the ocean, 90s inland," where driving down from Tahoe in the summer means a temperature swing from 80 as you leave Truckee to 100 in Vacaville to 55 as you cross the Bay Bridge. I couldn't help it: as I listened to the weather report, I had to laugh. 65 is cold! Ha ha!
</p>

<p>
"Don't mock the weather woman!" Al yelled from the bathroom. "Why not?" said I. "She thinks 65 is cold! She's suggesting I wear layers on Thursday, when it dips to 62! I thought for sure on the east coast cold would mean COLD."
</p>

<p>
"You're tempting fate," replied Al. "She's going to have her revenge in January, when the definition of cold will be revised to something horrific. If you mock her now, we'll be in trouble later." He's probably right; I guess 65 feels "cold" if you've had nothing below 75 (and many weeks above 90) for months on end. "Cold" here really means "10 degrees colder than yesterday." On the other side of winter, 50 will be lauded as a temperature at which you can run around outside without a coat, and 65 will be described as downright balmy.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I'll be tempting fate and continuing to laugh at the weather woman. And waiting for the day when I'll be able to wear a sweater without sweating.
</p>
