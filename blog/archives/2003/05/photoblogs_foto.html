<h3 class="title">Photoblogs &amp; Fotologs</h3>

<p>
There was an article in Sunday's New York Times called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/25/arts/design/25BOXE.html" target="a8_win">Prospecting for Gold Among the Photoblogs</a>; I read it with interest, hoping to see some of my favorite sites mentioned and to learn about a few new ones.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the article focused mostly on the photos that the author didn't like rather than the ones she did. Am I wrong in thinking that the NYT takes more pleasure in pointing out the dangers/idiocy/banality of blogging than blogging's pearls of wisdom, its power to inform and connect, its art? Someday, I hope to see fewer articles about Times reporters getting lost on the web and a new column covering text, photo, and art blogs (and other variations that might someday emerge) worth reading/viewing. Given that a good chunk of the Times' circulation is outside of the New York area, an article about worthwhile places to visit in cyberspace are could be more useful to far-flung readers than the current listings of New York gallery and theater openings. Just a thought.
