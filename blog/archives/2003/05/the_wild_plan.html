<h3 class="title">The Wild Plan</h3>

<p>
Well, the Wild beat the Canucks in the 2nd round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, so we've had to revise our plans. I honestly didn't think they'd make it to the third round (though, to be fair, I didn't think they'd make it to the second round, either), so no there was no hockey-watching in our weekend schedule.
</p>

<p>
The new plan is to watch the Wild game on Saturday at noon, then go out house-hunting on the Peninsula (that should give us enough time to see two or three houses), and then go to our own hockey game in San Jose. We'll go to the track on Sunday, then continue up to the city for dinner with Terence and Kathleen. Whew! I'm glad we can squeeze it all in, and I'm not sad about not being able to house-hunt in the city&#8212;normally I'd do some research ahead of time and have a schedule planned out, and I didn't have time to do that this week. I figure we can look in the city again next month.
