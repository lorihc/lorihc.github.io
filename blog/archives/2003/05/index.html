<h3 class="title">More Water Woes</h3>

<p>
Plumber #2 is still working out in our front yard (2 days later), but that isn't the day's biggest water news. The big news is that it's been a really rainy spring, and for some reason, my office building has its gutter drainpipes *inside* the building rather than outside it. (You can probably guess where I'm going with this, right?) Well, for those of you who couldn't guess, here's the story:
</p>

<p>
At about 2pm today, I heard a loud <i>clunk</i> followed by a gushing water sound. I knew what it was immediately; when I was taking pictures of the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2003/04/double_rainbow.html">rainbow</a> last month, I'd noticed the drain cap and photographed it because I thought it was interesting. "Holy shit!" I yelled, we've got a flood! Call Bonnie [our admin]!" Bonnie wasn't at her desk, so Winsha ran upstairs to tell the receptionist, and Vic hollered for wastebaskets. Dan, Vic, and Debbie set up a bucket brigade as the water that had gushed out in the first few seconds seeped under Alain's cube. 
</p>

<p>
Irina had the presence of mind to think of the power strips on the floor, and hurriedly unplugged everything in Alain's cube before the water could reach it. Meanwhile, a plumber was already on the premises (though it's not clear whether he was there to fix the clog that caused our flood or some other problem on the roof), so he came down, saw us running back and forth to the kitchen with the wastebaskets, and said he'd be right back with a new cap. Vic asked if we could use his plunger to try to plug the hole, and he said fine and left.
</p>

<p>
Dan plugged the hole with the plunger, and for a few minutes, everything was looking up. That is, until Dan couldn't hold back the water any longer, and it EXPLODED out of the pipe, drenching him and flooding three more cubes, including mine. Luckily I'd piled all my power strips and cords in my chair, but the idea of standing around in a puddle of water with electrical equipment all around me did not appeal. I quickly unhooked my PC laptop, locked up my Mac, and called my husband to come get me. I've been working at home since about 3:30. Hope my cube isn't all smelly and mildewy on Monday.
</p>

<p>
Photos of Dan holding back the deluge (L) and my cube after some of the water had receeded (R) by Dalbir, who had the presence of mind to document the events.

<h3 class="title">New Haircut, and Bread in the Water Line</h3>

<p>
On Saturday night we finally got our water turned back on at the house, though Plumber #2 warned us to "watch out for bread in the line." Apparently he'd plugged the various pieces of copper tubing with bits of squished-up white bread to keep dirt from getting in the line. Of course, now there was *bread* in the line, and I'm not sure that that's any better. It certainly wasn't for the kitchen faucet, which clogged immediately; my husband had to get under there with a water jug and flush all the bread out before we could use the sink.
</p>

<p>
While he was busy doing that (and calling me out to turn the faucet on from time to time), I was busy in the bathroom, having a hair crisis. Usually I cut my own hair&#8212;until it's time for a completely new style, in which case I book a flight to Baltimore to see my sister and an appointment at <a href="http://www.hugosalon.com/Hugo-enter.html" target="a8_win">Hugo Salon</a> to see Toni. I'd been talking about getting a new cut for a couple weeks, but I didn't get on the stick quick enough before I had a hair meltdown.
</p>

<p>
Basically, I was standing in the bathroom after taking a (blessed-after-two-days-without-water) shower, and the thought of having to dry the overbleached birdsnest of a mop on my head made me run for the scissors. I shouted to Al that I was going to cut my hair (one last chance to stop me) as I combed my overlong bangs forward, and when he shouted "OK!" back, I started cutting. It took a few tries to get it looking like an intentional cut rather than an accidental butchering, and it still doesn't look as clean as Toni would make it, but it'll do for now. At least I don't have to blow-dry it anymore, or tuck a huge swath of bangs behind my ear. The spikes of the 90s are back, baby!

<p>
My husband and I have an activity-filled weekend ahead of us, and I can't wait. We're planning another outing to <a href="http://www.baymeadows.com/" target="a8_win">Bay Meadows</a> on Saturday afternoon, followed by our <a href="http://www.logitechice.com/icecentresj/webref/display-schedule.php?team=79&season=2" target="a8_win">weekly hockey game</a> on Saturday night. On Sunday we're going to see a few open houses in San Carlos and San Francisco, and then we'll have dinner with Terence and Kathleen. We're hoping that they can squeeze us in at the <a href="http://www.slanteddoor.com/" target="a8_win">Slanted Door</a>, but the backup plan (I think) is tapas at the <a href="http://www.thirstybear.com/" target="a8_win">Thirsty Bear</a>.
</p>

<p>
The best part is, it's supposed to be SUNNY! And on Sunday (I've heard a rumor), we may hit 70 degrees (about 21, for those of you in Celcius-counting countries). Woo hoo! The rainy spring has been great for hiking around, pretending San Carlos is Ireland, but enough already. Bring on the sun!

<h3 class="title">The Wild Plan</h3>

<p>
Well, the Wild beat the Canucks in the 2nd round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, so we've had to revise our plans. I honestly didn't think they'd make it to the third round (though, to be fair, I didn't think they'd make it to the second round, either), so no there was no hockey-watching in our weekend schedule.
</p>

<p>
The new plan is to watch the Wild game on Saturday at noon, then go out house-hunting on the Peninsula (that should give us enough time to see two or three houses), and then go to our own hockey game in San Jose. We'll go to the track on Sunday, then continue up to the city for dinner with Terence and Kathleen. Whew! I'm glad we can squeeze it all in, and I'm not sad about not being able to house-hunt in the city&#8212;normally I'd do some research ahead of time and have a schedule planned out, and I didn't have time to do that this week. I figure we can look in the city again next month.

<h3 class="title">And The Band Played On</h3>

<p>
I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312241356/avocado8/" target="a8_win">And the Band Played On</a> on the plane back from Baltimore yesterday. Truly an amazing, powerful book&#8212;part medical mystery, part political thriller, part history of the evolution of the gay community&#8212;it was difficult to put down. I highly recommend the paperback version, since you'll want to carry this 672-page monster with you wherever you might find a few minutes to read.
</p>

<p>
There were many revelations in the book (at least for me); it was interesting to learn, for example, that while San Francisco was considered the "AIDS capital," New York City had three times as many cases. San Francisco was not AIDS central because everyone was infected, as most Americans seemed to think, but rather because it was the only city that was implementing any kind of coordinated AIDS policy.
</p>

<p>
I also didn't realize until I checked the copyright date, pages before finishing the book, that it was published in 1987. I'd heard of the book before, but I hadn't realized that it had been out for so long. That made it even more remarkable that so much of the information in the book was news to me; apparently, the biggest revelation of all was how ill-informed about the unfolding of the AIDS epidemic I'd been.
</p>

<p>
There were many read-out-loud-to-Al-in-amazement moments, but it's hard to think of them all now. As I said to Al when I finished the book, I can't imagine starting the book again at the beginning, trying to go back to when I didn't know what I know now. For me, this book has become the dividing line between my Before and my After.

<h3 class="title">Must Be a Glitch</h3>

  <p>
  This morning as I was driving to work, I got stuck behind a big white van advertising doggie day care. I noticed the big yellow sticker on the back when I almost slammed into it; traffic had apparently stopped or slowed significantly in front of the van, which I couldn't see around. I merged right as quickly as possible and got off at Marsh Road. I hadn't planned to go to Starbucks this morning, but I decided that  traffic stopping right at the Marsh exit must be a sign.
  </p>
  <p>
  When I pulled into the Starbucks parking lot at Marsh and Bay, I noticed the white doggie day care van in the prime spot by the door, and wondered how it had gotten in front of me (I didn't think it had exited at Marsh). On closer inspection, I realized it was an SUV and not a van, and that the stickers were different. This was another white doggie day care vehicle, not the one I'd been following.
  </p>
  <p>
  I went inside and was happy to see that the line ahead of me consisted of only three people, instead of the 8 I'd faced yesterday. Considering the speed with which they'd served all 9 of us, I figured this would be fast. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Customers #1 and #2 were a woman and an approximately 11 year-old boy. There were piles of coins spread out on the counter, apparently extracted from a plastic baggie, which held a few more. Between the woman and the boy was a small change purse bulging with $100 bills. There was much wrangling going on behind the counter; I couldn't figure out over what. The barista, meanwhile, managed to flag down customer #3 and ask him what he wanted. He had it (a tall caramel macchiato) in his hands before the drama at the registers had played out.
  </p>
  <p>
  By the time the barista had served me my decaf tall soy 1-pump mocha, Customer #1 had moved on to the condiments counter with her Venti something or other, her Grande something or other, her change purse full of hundreds, and her baggie of coins. Apparently  the 11 year-old, whose Frappucino was melting in front of him, wasn't hers (the coins, yes; the kid, no). He paid for his Frappucino, two madelines, and two snickerdoodles with a hundred dollar bill. I thought it was exceedingly odd that the woman with the hundreds would pay with coins, and a kid, whom you'd expect to pay with coins, would pay with a hundred.
  </p>
  <p>
  It turns out the hundred wasn't his. As I left the shop, I saw him handing the Frappucino, the cookies, and the $89 in change to&#8212;you could see this coming, right?&#8212;the woman behind the wheel of the doggie day care van.
  </p>

<h3 class="title">Things Overheard at the Airport</h3>

  <p>
  For reasons I choose not to go into, we were not able to board our 8:10am flight to Vancouver this morning, and instead were re-booked on the 2:35pm flight. We should still make it to B.C. in time for me to shop for a stick before the first game of my hockey tournament, so that part's not so bad. The bad part is that I got up at 4:50am after 5 hours of sleep, and I am now royally cranky. I am desperately trying not to think of missed sightseeing, shopping, and eating opportunities, and to be as enthusiastic as Al is when he says, &quot;we can have lunch at Max's!&quot; Unfortunately, while I certainly agree that Max's makes good sandwiches, and it's nice that they make them available here in the airport &quot;restaurants&quot; (along with even-more-bitter-than-usual cups of Peet's coffee), I don't find the prospect of getting a sandwich for lunch very cheering.
  </p>
  <p>
  I was hoping that by sitting at the airport waiting for our flight rather than going home to wait we'd be able to pretend that our mini-vacation had already started, but I see now how incredibly dumb an idea that was. I just found the notion of sitting at home  depressing, and going out shopping for jeans or bras or books or magazines (all of which are on my list of current necessities) or otherwise killing time productively around the Peninsula wasn't possible, given that almost nothing except Starbucks and Rolling Pin Donuts (both of which we visited in an attempt to cheer ourselves) 
  was open at 7:30am. So we came back here and checked in my hockey bag and stick at around 8:30, and we've been looking in the airport bookstore, napping on the uncomfortable (but thankfully devoid of armrests) rows of seats at the Alaska Airlines gates, and grumpily muttering &quot;shut UP!&quot; under our breath at the scads of people who insist on having personal conversations at top volume. (OK, I admit, it's only me doing the muttering; Al is merely rolling his eyes occasionally.) Things overheard so far:
  </p>
  <p>
  From the row behind me, one side of a cell conversation: &quot;Yes, hi, this is Dr. ______, returning your call. I just wanted to get a little background before we go any further. What is your current mood now? [pause for response] Have you ever been suicidal before? [pfr] Are you currently suicidal? [pfr] Have you ever been hospitalized?
[pfr] And the current medications you're on were prescribed by your primary care physician? [pfr] Right, and now you're looking to see a psychiatrist?&quot; All this and more, including scheduling of the appointment and a detailed explanation of the cancellation policy, delivered in that gentle, almost sing-song doctor voice that is designed to put you at ease while at the same time conveying supreme authority and competence.
  </p>
  <p>
  While sleeping on a row of Alaska Airlines waiting area seats: &quot;WELL, *THIS* ISN'T SO BAD!&quot; Am I wrong to think this woman's comment was sarcastic, and designed to wake me up (which it did)?
  </p>
  <p>
  While attempting to regain the level of blissful sleep so rudely interrupted by the woman above: Guy: &quot;...middle and an aisle.&quot;  Girl: [whines] Guy: &quot;Well, I'm in A, so maybe you're in A too. Though maybe not.... I hate Wells Fargo! They always screw me.&quot; I couldn't figure out why this guy was blaming Wells Fargo for a shitty seat assignment, but I see now that I am sitting across from a Wells Fargo ATM machine. It's possible that they were having this discussion while extracting money from it.
  </p>
  <p>
  From four seats down at Gate 22, one side of a cell conversation (the side with the incredibly loud Boston accent): &quot;I think it's down to the Off-White and the Wheatberry. Picture a long room,&quot; and here he gestured with both arms out in front of him, so that he had to shout even louder into the phone that was now about 2 feet from his mouth, &quot;that's like 20-25' with cathedral ceilings. See, I think you should use the Off-White on the walls and the Wheatberry on the flat part of the ceilings, because then the cohntrast isn't too much...&quot; Amazingly, the volume of the conversation increased as he warmed to the subject of the slight yellowish tint of the Wheatberry... until an older gentleman from Gate 21 came over to ask him to lower his voice.
Though he looked like a guy who would argue, he acceeded to the request.
Sometimes people surprise me.
</p>

There was an article in Sunday's New York Times called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/25/arts/design/25BOXE.html" target="a8_win">Prospecting for Gold Among the Photoblogs</a>; I read it with interest, hoping to see some of my favorite sites mentioned and to learn about a few new ones.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the article focused mostly on the photos that the author didn't like rather than the ones she did. Am I wrong in thinking that the NYT takes more pleasure in pointing out the dangers/idiocy/banality of blogging than blogging's pearls of wisdom, its power to inform and connect, its art? Someday, I hope to see fewer articles about Times reporters getting lost on the web and a new column covering text, photo, and art blogs (and other variations that might someday emerge) worth reading/viewing. Given that a good chunk of the Times' circulation is outside of the New York area, an article about worthwhile places to visit in cyberspace are could be more useful to far-flung readers than the current listings of New York gallery and theater openings. Just a thought.

Al just called to see what time I wanted to be picked up from work. He started the conversation with a bright, "how are YOU?" I replied that if yesterday (a long, horrible, demoralizing day) was a 2, today was a 4. "That's twice as good as yesterday!" he exclaimed. "Quite an improvement!" I was thinking of it as "still below midpoint," but I find his attitude so cheering that I'm determined to see it his way.
