<h3 class="title">Hump Day</h3>

<p>
First off, for those of you who are concerned about my welfare, I survived this year's April Fool's Day unscathed, and I don't have <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/sars/sarsfaq/en/" target="a8_win">Sars</a>. I'm responding well to the Zithromax, thank you very much.
</p>

<p>
Al drove me to work this morning, and as we pulled around the circular driveway in front of my office building, I heard the woman who was giving this morning's Pentagon briefing read an excerpt from <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/03/23/do2305.xml&sSheet=/opinion/2003/03/23/ixop.html">this article</a>, which I'd found linked from <a href="http://journal.cynthiachew.com/" target="a8_win">Cynthia Chew's website</a> over a week ago. Talk about yesterday's news...
</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>
As I was unpacking my laptops this morning and preparing to get ready to work (or rather, blog), I was thinking about Wednesdays. For some reason, I've always thought of Wednesdays as different from every other day of the week&#8212;though for reasons that have evolved over time. When I was a kid in elementary school, Wednesdays were "short days": school let out around 1pm instead of around 3pm. For years (even well into high school, when the short day rotated along with 7th period), I pictured my week as looking like this:
</p> 

<p align="center">
<img src="/blog/images/short_day.gif" class="noborder" width="385" height="93" alt="days of the week graph, with Wednesday being a shorter column than the others" />
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure when it happened, but somewhere along the line, Wednesday became taller&#8212;taller, in fact, than the other days of the week. (I know it was after I'd ceased to hear Wednesday referred to as "hump day," as it it is often referred to in Boston.) So though I never think of Wednesday as "hump day," when I look at my post-childhood mental picture of the week, I can see where  the term comes from:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="/blog/images/hump_day.gif" class="noborder" width="385" height="100" alt="days of the week graph, with Wednesday being a slightly taller column than the others" />
</p>

<p>
Funny that in this adult mental picture the days of the week have also become gray, but that's another story.
</p>

<p>
What I was thinking about this morning was how Wednesday has once again altered my mental picture of the week. For about a year now, Wednesday has been Work at Home Day. (It used to be Thursday, but it was moved to Wednesday not, as you might imagine, for alliterative reasons, but rather to make sure that all the engineers were in the building on Tuesdays and Thursdays, when the product marketing and management teams were also here.) I happen to be in the office today, as I am most Wednesdays. I got in the habit of not working at home on Wednesdays because [a] when I had my house in Truckee, it made more sense for me to work at home on Fridays or Mondays, and [b] with everyone else working at home, the office is really quiet. The quiet is probably what has most influenced my current mental picture of the week:
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="/blog/images/wah_day.gif" class="noborder" width="385" height="100" alt="days of the week graph, with Wednesday being lighter color than the others" />
</p>

<p>
Wednesday has become this slightly ethereal day in the middle of the week, one that always manages to take me by surprise. Every week I walk into the office on Wednesday, hear the hum of florescent lights, muted traffic sounds through the heavy glass windows, and curiously, no clicking keyboards, and wonder, "where is everybody?"  Sometimes I catch on right away, and other times it takes me a couple hours, until people don't return from the meetings that I assumed they were attending. 
</p>

<p>
It could be that I work in the office on Work at Home Wednesdays not because of my house in Truckee (which I sold) or because of the quiet, but because I'm unable to distinguish Wednesday from any other weekday. I go in to work because that's what I did yesterday, and that's what I'll do tomorrow. Maybe Wednesdays aren't so special after all...

I just saw a rainbow that was bigger, brighter, and more complete than any rainbow I've ever seen before. I could see the entire curve and both ends, and it was so vivid it looked like a child's painting. There was a fainter, second rainbow just behind it, too. I took a bunch of photos, but I'm not sure any of them will really capture the magnificence of it.

Spent most of yesterday noodling around in various bits of code. I compiled the files I'd changed, but I guess I never did a rebuild of the whole project, because when I went to run it this morning, everything was out of date. Must've been the #ifdef I added to one of the main framework files.
</p>

<p>
From <a href="http://jenett.org/ageless/" target="a8_win">The Ageless Project</a>, 5 people who share my birthday:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.destinywalking.com/" target="a8_win">Sarah</a> (1953)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.digitalien.org/sofa/sofablog/sofablog.html" target="a8_win">Peter</a> (1959)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hivelogic.com/" target="a8_win">Dan</a> (1972)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.upsaid.com/jessenigma/" target="a8_win">Jessica</a> (1984)</li>
</ul>

<p>
From my mental archives, 1 person I've lost touch with and wonder what she's doing now: Stacia Lynds. Stacia, are you still out there? Thanks to you and to <a href="http://www.lasttrainhome.com/band/band.html" target="a8_win">Marty</a> for making me feel welcome when I moved to Northern Virginia back in 1990. Hope you're doing well.
</p>

<p>
The build is done...back to work.

<h3 class="title">Another Sweeping Generalization</h3>

<p>
I've been doing some research lately. I've come up with a hypothesis that I'm trying to verify&#8212;entirely through anecdotal evidence, which isn't very scientific, I know. However, it's all I've got right now. Here's the hypothesis:
</p>

<p>
Women baristas make better lattes than men.
</p>

<p>
I had noticed that sometimes I got really excellent lattes (creamy, smooth, comforting), and other times, they sucked (bitter, sour, scorched, unsatisfying). I thought about who had served me the good ones and who had served me the bad ones, and I came up with a commonality: women were behind the former, and men the latter. I think men tend to overheat the milk (regardless of the kind&#8212;whole, skim, soy).
</p>

<p>
I've been putting this hypothesis to the test, and so far it's holding up. The smoothness of the espresso varies and does not seem to be related to the gender of the barista, but men definitely seem to have their thermostats set permanently on extra-hot, and women lean toward "drinkable now." (This penchant for non-tongue-burning temperatures can be taken to undesirable extremes: I recently got a short decaf latte that could be called lukewarm at best. And yes, I got it from a female barista.)
</p>

<p>
Because the smoothness of the espresso varies, it's important to get the temperature of the milk just right. Well-steamed milk can even out a bitter shot, and it can make a smooth one sublime&#8212;the ultimate comforting beverage. Scorched milk can make even a smooth shot taste icky. 
</p>

<p>
If I come up with further evidence to support my hypothesis, or&#8212;as is not entirely unlikely&#8212;I become obsessive and start cataloging various short decaf latte experiences in a database, I'll follow up. In the meantime, I'll be smiling whenever I see a chick behind the steamer at Starbucks.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Riveting Reading</h3>

<p>
Since finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804109990/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</a> a few weeks ago, I've had nothing to read at night or on the train. It hasn't been so bad, since I've mostly been driving to work lately and using the between-book interval to catch up on all the TV shows TiVo had recorded for me.
</p>

<p>
After watching And the Band Played On on HBO and The Last of the Mohicans (for the first time, all the way through; I've seen bits and pieces before) on DVD this weekend, I added these two titles to my reading list (which already contained <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449005615/ref=nosim/avocado8" target="a8_win">Seabiscuit: An American Legend</a>, on <a href="http://www.megnut.com/books/000133.asp" target="a8_win">Meg's recommendation</a>). With an active interest in starting a new book and the prospect of at least two train commutes looming this week, I proposed a trip to Tower Books, which is within walking distance of our house and open until midnight 365 days a year.
</p>

<p>
On the "featured" table near the entrance I found the Seabiscuit book in trade paperback (feels like a hardback, but convenient for toting around) for 30% off, and immediately picked it up. Above it was another title for 30% off, one that was also heralded as a New York Times bestseller: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805063897/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Nickel and Dimed</a>. It looked like fairly easy and interesting reading, so I bought that too.
</p>

<p>
I opted to read Nickel and Dimed first, and devoured about 70 pages between the end of Law & Order: Criminal Intent and falling asleep. I read several passages out loud to Al along the way, and got into a hysterical laughing fit over the phrase "citrus fart". I brought the book with me on the train this morning, and read from the time I reached the platform from the time I... well, I was going to say, "set foot in my office building," but to be honest, I've been sneakily reading while mail downloads and the product builds. Fascinating stuff.
</p>

<p> 
I took a detour on the walk from the train to stop at the Starbucks in San Carlos, and the guy who took my order noticed the book in my hand. "Great book," he said. "Yeah, I'm finding it really interesting," I replied. "What's that?" asked the girl (<a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2003/04/another_sweepin.html" target="a8_win">yay!</a>) behind the espresso machine. "Nickel and Dimed," the guy informed her. "Yeah, I read that," said the girl. I turned back to the guy. "You know, I was reading passages out loud to my husband last night, and his question was, 'why didn't she ever apply at Starbucks?'" "She still would have needed two jobs," he said.
</p>

<p>
I called Al to relate the conversation, and his point wasn't that Starbucks would pay better, but that the working conditions would be better, or at least less menial and depressing than working at Denny's or Merry Maids. Maybe I'll stop at the Starbucks again tomorrow and continue the conversation with the chap who took my order. Or perhaps Al and I can find out for ourselves someday: We keep talking about chucking it all and going to work at Starbucks...

<h3 class="title">Why the Silence?</h3>

<p>
Why have I been quiet for a few days? Mainly because I've been busy with other things, mulling over ideas that I'm not yet ready to write about, and because I'm not a fan of "I have nothing to say" posts. I've written them before, and invariably, they're the entries I enjoy least when I go back and review sections of my personal history. So I've opted to focus on work (which could use some focusing on) and reading rather than writing.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of reading, I spent most of the weekend devouring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449005615/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Seabiscuit: An American Legend</a>. Too many extraneous details for my taste, and unlike most reviewers, I didn't find the histories of the owners, trainers, and jockeys who had come in contact with Seabiscuit as interesting as the horse himself, but the stories about Seabiscuit's training and the play-by-play accounts of his races were incredibly absorbing. The snapshot of racing in general was also interesting, but (perhaps because I was a racing fan as a kid and was already familiar with the sport) more in a "hm, I didn't know that" kind of way rather than in a "WOW, I didn't know that!" way. Whatever flaws I found in the the human story, however, are made up for by Seabiscuit's charisma (and Marcela's&#8212;she's the one human I wanted to know more about) and the thrilling accounts of his physical feats. (I was reminded more than once of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679813438/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Black Stallion</a> series I'd read and loved as a pre-teen.) The Seabiscuit story is one that's worth knowing about. If you don't have the patience or time for the book, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/seabiscuit/" target="a8_win">American Experience</a> is airing a special on Seabiscuit on April 21.

<h3 class="title">Just Like Me</h3>

<p>
I was noodling around Amazon.com this morning, looking for interesting books to add to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/3O9CGSTNUGWEN/ref%3Dwl%5Fs%5F3/" target="a8_win">Wish List</a> and presents to buy for family members, when I stumbled across a link that said, "Just Like You" in a place called Lori's Store. I was dying to see what someone Just Like Me would look like, so I followed the link. "Crushing disappointment" is about the best thing I can say about it; in fact, I might sue for libel.
</p>

<p>
The page was arranged in three columns: the left contained items that the person Just Like Me (only from Texas) and I had both bought and/or rated; the middle column contained recommendations based on what the other person also liked; and the right contained items that only I had bought or rated (in other words, things I didn't have in common with the person Just Like Me in Texas). If the column on the right had been on the left, I would have said, "wow, this person is just like me!" Instead, the column on the left could have belonged to any Harry Potter-reading, Soprano-watching average Jane... and thus, the middle column was wildly off-base, containing as it did the following:

<p>
Of course, Amazon doesn't know about the books I've bought at Tower Books, or Books Inc., or Book Buyers, or any number of other bookstores I seem to be inexorably drawn to. Perhaps if I rate a few of the titles I've bought elsewhere on Amazon, it will find someone more like me. Somehow, I doubt she'll be from Texas.

<h3 class="title">Seabiscuit in Motion</h3>

<p>
I watched the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/seabiscuit/" target="a8_win">American Experience episode on Seabiscuit</a> last night (we Tivo'ed it, which accounts for the 1 day lag). For me, the book was a bit too long, but the TV program left me wanting more (perhaps another 30 minutes or so?). I'm glad they left out some of the (what I thought were) extraneous details, such as Charles Howard's beginnings in San Francisco and the shitpile and brothel in Tijuana, but I wanted more on how Seabiscuit was trained, ridden, and raced. I think for Al it was perfect, because he filled in some of the gaps with info he remembered me reading/paraphrasing to him from the book (for example, when he watched the footage of the match race with War Admiral, he said, "Oh, is that the homemade bell you were telling me about?") without having to have slogged through all the book's deep background.
</p>

<p>
Having said that, the broadcast was a great companion to the book, and is worth watching for the commentary by Norah Christianson (daughter of jockey Red Pollard) and for the still photos and film footage of Seabiscuit and his entourage. As to the former, I have no idea why Christianson was so compelling, but she's what stuck with me after the fact. Perhaps it was the emotion with which she related her parts of the story. Regarding the visuals, for all the extra info that the book had, what I missed most was more photos, and the documentary (of course) serves them up. I remembered Meg using the phrase "such a Seabiscuit look!" in one of her blog entries, but what struck me wasn't so much the expressions of the horse as the expressions of the jockey. You can tell Red Pollard has a stretchy, twinkle-in-the-eye face from the few photos in the book, but you really get a sense of the guy when you see him moving. 
</p>

<p>
As a side note, in between reading the book and watching American Experience, Al and I went to the track this weekend. I spent an entire spring at <a href="http://www.goldengatefields.com/" target="a8_win">Golden Gate Fields</a> during a personal depression a few years back, but I'd only been to <a href="http://www.baymeadows.com" target="a8_win">Bay Meadows</a> once, for a company picnic in the infield. The place took on more significance when we realized how long it had been around, and that Seabiscuit had raced there many years ago. I had suspected that <a href="http://www.theshopsattanforan.com/" target="a8_win">Tanforan</a>  had once been a racetrack based on the racehorses on its signage, but I didn't know for sure until I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449005615/ref%3Dnosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Seabiscuit</a>. Neither of us would have guessed that Bay Meadows and Tanforan both existed at the same time and had such illustrious <a href="http://www.baymeadows.com/about/history.html" target="a8_win">histories</a>. This connection to the past made spending a Sunday at Bay Meadows very appealing, no depression required.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, we had a lovely day watching the horses run and attempting to pick the winners. I tend to go for the exotic bets, so while I occasionally guessed right (getting two out of three horses for a Trifecta in one race, and one half of a Quinella in a couple others), I didn't win any money. Al, being a hedger, won a few times by betting on a horse to place or show. The nice thing about betting on horses is that you don't get that icky feeling you do when you lose money in a casino. The horses are so beautiful and powerful and cool, and the outdoor track is so completely the opposite of the cavelike, smoke-choked casinos that you can't but feel happy&#8212;even when you've left $50 behind.

<h3 class="title">What I Remember of METCO</h3>

<p>
Thirty years ago this September, I started Kindergarten in Needham, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. What I didn't notice then (how could I? I was four and half years old, and had known nothing else) was that the town was predominantly white. There were black kids at school, sure; and by first or second grade, I think, I was aware that they took the bus to school. I'm not sure when I learned that they didn't live in Needham.
</p>

<p>
I must've known by fifth grade, because after school one day I saw a girl who was a year ahead of me walking across the softball field toward the edge of the school grounds, and was immediately concerned. "She's going to miss her bus!" I said to my friend. The friend replied, "She lives here." Me: "Really?" I think this was my first inkling that a black family lived in Needham, that black kids didn't just arrive on buses.
</p>

<p>
By eighth grade, I knew that a couple of my friends lived in Roxbury, but I still didn't know that Roxbury was predominantly black, and I wouldn't learn until high school that it was considered a place where white people <em>just didn't go</em>. I got it confused with West Roxbury, where my grandmother was in the hospital and where some of my mom's piano students lived. 
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure when I learned the term "<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0318/p13s01-lepr.html" target="a8_win">METCO</a> kids", but certainly I knew it by ninth grade. I remember the METCO buses lining up on Webster Avenue behind the school to drop students off in the morning and pick them up in the afternoon, and that <a href="http://www.lincnet.org/metco/mccandparents.html" target="a8_win">some days the buses left later</a> so that METCO kids could participate in after-school activities.
</p>

<p>
I must've known by tenth grade that one of the goals of METCO was integration, because I remember thinking when I passed the three or four tables of METCO kids all sitting together in the cafeteria at lunch that it wasn't working very well. I still saw my friend Chris from eighth grade in the halls sometimes, and I was immensely proud of him for his success on the basketball team, but I'd lost track of my friend Robert. I didn't participate in sports myself (not that the jocks seemed particularly well integrated, either), and all of my close friends were white.
</p>

<p>
When I announced that I was moving to North Carolina in 1984, one of the black kids in my class told me he'd never want to live in the south. "Black people are different down there," he said. My cousin, who had moved to Needham from Florida a couple years before, had voiced a similar sentiment, and I had thought he was just being a racist southerner.
</p>

<p>
What I didn't know until maybe 6 or 7 years ago, when I saw a television movie about busing in Boston, was that Boston was more racist than the South in many ways. In the South, people were just more open about their racism. In the North, you could live in a white suburb, and you never had to tell anyone what you really thought (and believe me, when it was suddenly kosher to voice negative opinions about other races, I got an earful&#8212;from a member of my own family, to my great shock). But back to busing: I'd had no idea how acrimonious the issue had been. I know I was young, but how could I have been so oblivious to this?
</p>

<blockquote>
Thirty years ago, Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of Federal District Court found that Boston school officials had deliberately created a dual public school system, one that discriminated against black students. He ordered forced busing to desegregate. Violence erupted as white parents threw rocks at buses carrying black children to their neighborhood schools. Thousands of white students left the system and enrolled in parochial schools. [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/25/education/25BOST.html?th" target="a8_win">full article</a> (free registration required)]
</blockquote>

<p>
I knew that many kids in my town attended parochial schools, but I hadn't realized that it had been caused by busing. As it turns out, it wasn't. What I learned today was that all the fighting was over a <em>forced</em> busing plan in the city of Boston. METCO was completely <em>voluntary</em>, and it was <a href="http://www.lincnet.org/metco/whatismetco.html" target="a8_win">founded</a> in 1966, almost a decade before Judge Garrity's ruling.
</p>

<p>
Once again, I feel as uninformed about the events of my own childhood as I did when I saw that movie on busing. It was only in trying to find the definition of METCO on Google that I've discovered as much as I have, and now I want to find out more. I've put <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300087659/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">The Other Boston Busing Story: What's Won and Lost Across the Boundary Line</a> on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/3O9CGSTNUGWEN/ref%3Dwl%5Fs%5F3/" target="a8_win">Amazon Wish List</a> for that reason.
</p>

<p>
I'm also starting to wonder if it's time for another trip to Needham, this time with an archaeological goal in mind. I've been to Hunter, NY and Rochester, NY with each of my parents to discover their personal histories; maybe it's time to explore my own.
</p>

<p>
The water main at our house broke today (or, more likely, last night, when I noticed a trickle of water running down the side of the driveway). My husband is busy dealing with plumbers when he should be teaching a class (hopefully the other instructor can manage on his own for a bit), we're stressing out about the cost and the likelihood that we won't be able to use the facilities until tomorrow, and my entire family has gone AWOL. In the age of cell phones and business lines, I can't reach anybody for advice. FART!

<h3 class="title">You Need a Permit For Everything</h3>

<p>
After not being able to reach my family (most importantly, my dad or my brother-in-law, who know about plumbing and piping and digging), I called my husband back with my $.02 on the situation: I don't care about the cost. My priorities are getting the job done right, and getting it done quickly. Ideally, I'd like to be able to have a glass of water when I get home, and to take a shower in the morning. He said that he was leaning that way also, and that Plumber #2 (the one with the more expensive of the two estimates) was still there.
</p>

<p>
My husband just called to say that he'd called Plumber #1 back to ask about permits&#8212;something #2's estimate included, but which #1 had said nothing about&#8212;and was told that yes, "you need a permit for everything," but really they just raise the cost of the job, and then an <em>inspector</em> needs to come out and everything, and really you can get by without one, blah blah blah. 
</p>

<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, Plumber #2 it is. 
</p>

<p>
Al gave him a small deposit, and he's already gone off to get the permit and will be back and digging by sundown. Hopefully we'll be able to use the bathroom before we go to bed!
