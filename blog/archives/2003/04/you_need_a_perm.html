<h3 class="title">You Need a Permit For Everything</h3>

<p>
After not being able to reach my family (most importantly, my dad or my brother-in-law, who know about plumbing and piping and digging), I called my husband back with my $.02 on the situation: I don't care about the cost. My priorities are getting the job done right, and getting it done quickly. Ideally, I'd like to be able to have a glass of water when I get home, and to take a shower in the morning. He said that he was leaning that way also, and that Plumber #2 (the one with the more expensive of the two estimates) was still there.
</p>

<p>
My husband just called to say that he'd called Plumber #1 back to ask about permits&#8212;something #2's estimate included, but which #1 had said nothing about&#8212;and was told that yes, "you need a permit for everything," but really they just raise the cost of the job, and then an <em>inspector</em> needs to come out and everything, and really you can get by without one, blah blah blah. 
</p>

<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, Plumber #2 it is. 
</p>

<p>
Al gave him a small deposit, and he's already gone off to get the permit and will be back and digging by sundown. Hopefully we'll be able to use the bathroom before we go to bed!
