<h3 class="title">More Travels Around the Web</h3>

<p>
My list of regularly-read weblogs is growing. Found <a href="http://journal.cynthiachew.com/" target="a8_win">another woman out there</a> who's on the fence about the war too, for similar reasons. (She's also just plain neat.) She had a link on her site to an <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/03/23/do2305.xml&sSheet=/opinion/2003/03/23/ixop.html" target="a8_win">interesting article</a> about a guy who went to Iraq to become a human shield without really understanding what he was doing.
</p>

<p>
This, at the same time that I've lost any sympathy I might have had for anti-war protestors in San Francisco. It seems the social terrorists have moved on from <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/03/21/MN106172.DTL" target="a8_win">blocking streets and assaulting commuters to staging vomit-ins</a>. (I do admit I have some sympathy for the knitters, even though crocheting is my blanket-making method of choice.)
</p>

<p>
In other news, my friend Heather discoverd a few years ago, when she started <a href="http://www.jezebel.com/mirror/" target="a8_win">Jezebel's Mirror</a> (and later Friends of Jezebel's Mirror), that she wasn't the only one who had a penchant for taking self-portraits in mirrors. (I think we all think we're the only ones who are doing it; like Heather, I had zillions of prints of me taken in various reflective surfaces over the years&#8212;and this was before I got a digital camera!&#8212;but I didn't realize that everyone else did, too.) FOJM eventually blossomed into the Mirror Project, and it has only increased in popularity since... which brings us to the present dilemma: the current MP servers can't handle the load. Please consider <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/fundingdrive/" target="a8_win">making a donation</a> (no amount too small!) so the narcissism-as-art can continue. And while you're at it, <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/submit/" target="a8_win">submit a photo</a>. C'mon, you know you've got one.
