<h3 class="title">Moving to Movable Type</h3>

<p>
I finally caved and installed <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" target="a8_win">Movable Type</a> on avocado8. This after moving my <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">hockey blog</a> over to <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/">lori-and-al.com</a> because it had MT... &lt;sigh&gt; I'm not sure if I'll move it back now. Anyway, I was using <a href="http://www.blogger.com/" target="a8_win">Blogger</a> for this general-blathering blog, but the archive settings were a pain to manage, and it didn't seem to have a bunch of features that I wanted. Plus, I've gotten used to manipulating the templates in MT. Oh, that everything were as easy to install and use as Movable Type...
</p>

<p>
Today I've been in build hell. I'm trying to check in a file that's horrifyingly difficult to merge, which means I need to get it into the build before anyone else changes it. However, before I can check it in, I have to verify that the program builds and runs with my changes. That's where I'm stuck: the Mac will build, but not run. Everyone else can build and run except me. I've sync'ed, I've force sync'ed, I've deleted objects, I've rebuilt a zillion times... and the app still crashes on startup. Arrrrgh! I've been advised to update to OSX 10.2.4, so that's what I'm doing now. Cross your fingers.

<h3 class="title">Wit's End</h3>

<p>
Well, updating OSX didn't help. :( Everything's running fine on Windows, though, so I might just check in and let the chips fall where they may. If I break the Mac build, I'll pay for it tomorrow (or later tonight). I hope it's not later tonight...

<h3 class="title">It's Magic</h3>

<p>
I hate that I don't know why/how, but my sandbox build no longer crashes on startup. The main build does, but for some reason, my sandbox is fixed. I'm afraid to breathe on it.

<h3 class="title">Top 10 Things I Love About the Bay Area</h3>

<p>
I compiled the following list for some colleagues who are trying to decide whether to move to the Bay Area, and I thought I'd share it here.
</p>

<ol>
<li>The weather.</li>  
<li>The diversity (and all the good things diversity brings: great food, great cultcha, new perspectives, art movies... I could go on, but I won't). San Francisco is basically the New York of the west coast, only sunnier.</li>
<li>The fact that you can <a href="/newthings/hockey/hockey1.html">start playing ice hockey at age 30</a> here, and actually have 100 other people your age to play with.</li>
<li>Snow is only 3 hours away, if you want it.</li>
<li>I don't feel like a freak (and this is not just about hair color). Everybody here is in software or networking or web development. An acquaintance once told me about a time he was sitting on a bench in South Park (in SF) at lunchtime. A guy on another bench let out an anguished "arrrrrgh!" and yelled, "does anyone know anything about blah blah blah system calls on Mac OS9?" Someone from across the park responded, "I do!" and went over to help the frustrated engineer. Pretty neat.</li>
<li>It's fun to live on the political and social bleeding edge. We may have energy, budget, tax, and education crises, but California leads the way in environmental and social policy. Whatever we're doing now, the rest of the country will be doing 10 years from now.</li>
<li>The food. Name a cuisine, we've got it here. And the variety of organic and vegetarian options is staggering.</li>
<li>It's a travel hub. Three major international airports serve the Bay Area, and it's as easy to get to Hawaii, Seoul, or Tokyo as it is to get to Boston, New York, or Dallas. If you hate to fly, the wine country, the mountains, and the Monterey Peninsula are all within 1-3 hours' drive.</li>
<li>Unlike in LA, it's actually feasible to walk here.</li>
<li>My husband. We both grew up in Massachusetts, have friends and relatives in Baltimore and DC, and travel to Hawaii regularly, but we met here. It's obviously the place to be!</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="title">Limbo is Not for Lori</h3>

<p>
I was talking to my mom on the phone last night about how lately I seem to be suffering from Weekend Depression, and how I haven't been looking forward to Cleaning Night as I used to (in fact, I'm dreading it these days). I speculated that the two phenomena might have something in common, since they started at around the same time, and both seem to stem from resentment of the Mountain View house. I think that now that I've given up my house in Truckee, I'm feeling a little stuck in Mountain View. I know that eventually Al & I will buy a new house together, and I'm excited about that prospect: it's why I didn't feel sad about putting my house on the market. I knew it was paving the way for something new and different and better. The problem is that I can't wait for the new, different, and better thing to come. As mom observed, "you'll take heaven or hell, but you can't stand limbo."

<h3 class="title">An Appropriate Thought for Spring</h3>

<p>
I got an e-mail from my friend <a href="http://electronicinternet.tripod.com/" target="a8_win">Jimmy</a> this morning, in which he used a phrase that totally captured my imagination. Here is the relevant excerpt:
</p>

<blockquote>
...it looks like we won't be moving west, at least for the time being.  If something big pops up for one of us, we would definitely consider it.  For now we are going to try to "<b>bloom where we're planted</b>", as Shayr says.
</blockquote>

<p>
I can just tell: that phrase is going to be stuck in my head all day, and probably longer. It makes me think of the things Al and I are doing to make our current home more livable, such as <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/archives/2003/03/house_hunters.html">rearranging the furniture</a> and planting flowers in the courtyard (the activity we've planned for this weekend). I'm sure there's more we could be doing, and all of it would help to stave off Weekend Depression.
</p>

<p>
Let's get blooming!
</p>

<h3 class="title">War: What Is It Good For?</h3>

<p>
What <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/tritone/2003/03/19/" target="nj">he said</a>.
</p>

<p>
Al and I have been talking about this since I switched from the Weather Channel to MSNBC yesterday morning and heard <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/886904.asp" target="a8_win">Brian Williams</a> say, "now we have two things we want to show you: first, a live shot of downtown Baghdad. And as you can see, nothing's happening there. Second, the podium in the White House press room, where we're waiting for Ari Fleischer to make an appearance. And of course, as soon as he does, we'll let you know." The network then proceeded to fill the screen with the  live shot of <em>nothing happening</em> in Baghdad while Brian chatted off-camera with a supposed expert on what might happen when the 48-hour deadline was reached.
</p>

<p>
"Ever since 9/11, I can't watch news coverage of events like this," Al said when I related the above. "It just makes me sick." Not to mention frustrated and angry. Shut <b>UP</b> if you have nothing new or useful to report! News is so cheap to produce that in the U.S., 24-hour news networks are popping up like weeds, and news "magazines" have replaced at least an hour of entertainment programming per night. Has anyone considered that the reason these programs are cheap to produce is because the quality is so low? This lowering of journalistic standards has basically chased Al and me away from television news entirely, but as <a href="http://www.rictus.com/" target="nj">nj</a> notes, NPR is no better. They recycle the same news and broadcast tedious White House press briefings in their entirety, too: they just do it without the benefit/handicap of boring B-roll or goofy computer-generated graphics in the background. As I listened to one of these press briefings on the drive in to work this morning, I thought, "I'm glad we have a press corps that's asking questions of our leadership, because that leadership might run amok if unchallenged. But must those questions be so inane?"
</p>

<p>
My frustration with the social terrorists that the media likes to call protestors has already led me to stew silently at home rather than take to the streets to argue for reason (because, let's face it, most of those protestors aren't arguing for reason&#8212;they're screaming 30 different messages at the top of their lungs while blocking traffic during rush hour). Now I fear that my frustration with the "news" media will lead me to ignore the war. This is a shame, because I really do want to understand what's going on. 
</p>

<p>
Frustration with the social terrorists isn't the only reason I've stayed home. I'm keeping to the sidelines until I can articulate what I really think about the war and its alternatives. In short, I feel ill-informed. For all the shouting in the streets and the 24-hour news and analysis, I don't feel any better equipped to form an opinion. And that's saying something, because I'm usually full of opinions and not shy about sharing them. 
</p>

<p>
So, what is this war good for? I don't know. Certainly not for fans of quality television programming, for the environment, or for our relations with the rest of the world (or for my productivity at work). And whether it makes the world a safer place or a more dangerous one remains to be seen. On the plus side, it seems to be keeping a lot of people busy, and as everyone knows, we Americans are happiest when we're busy. The evidence is all over <a href="http://www.cnn.com" target="a8_win">CNN</a>.

<h3 class="title">And Now a Word on Eating</h3>

<p>
Funny where you get when you hop around the web. I started at <a href="http://www.loobylu.com/" target="a8_win">Loobylu</a> this morning, then jumped from there to <a href="http://www.frenchtoastgirl.com/weblog/blogger.shtml" target="a8_win">French Toast Girl</a>, where I saw a link to <a href="http://iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=5&art_id=ct2003031620212555L130494&set_id=9" target="a8_win">a diet that involved eating everything with chopsticks</a>. The description of it reminded me of a book I read back in the mid-90s called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449003825/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Overcoming Overeating</a>. I totally understood the principles, but it was really hard to let go and surround myself with food, to trust that eventually I'd stop wanting to eat everything if I realized I could have whatever I wanted whenever I wanted it.
</p>

<p>
Lately I've been following a modified <a href="http://www.atkinscenter.com/" target="a8_win">Atkins</a> plan. I didn't start with Induction (where you eat as much meat as you want and only 3 cups of salad greens a day for at least two weeks) because I only have about 10 pounds to lose, and because Induction is difficult for a semi-vegetarian (I eat fish). I lost about 4 pounds at first, but lately I've been bouncing around in that 4-pound range. Some days at the top, where I started, and some days closer to the bottom. So for weight loss, apparently I have to be more diligent about counting my carbs. The best thing about this plan is that I've managed to kick my addiction to candy and baked goods. I don't worry too much about small amounts of sugar in my foods, and I eat diabetic-friendly chocolate (sweetened with maltitol or sucralose), but I've cut out the overt sugars that used to make up the majority of my daily calorie intake.
</p>

<p>
Getting rid of sugar is great, but I've never really been able to get a grip on eating normal quantities of food. I like to eat things one-after-the-other too much. It seems almost impossible for me *not* to eat while I'm working, too. It's something to do when I'm stuck. I'm not sure that chopsticks will slow me down all that much, either, since I'm fairly proficient with them (Al's Korean relatives were impressed; they had been prepared to offer me a fork until they saw me tackle my sushi and soba noodles like a native). I've tried banning food from my cube, but that goes out the window during crunch times.
</p>

<p>
The trick for me really is determining whether I'm hungry, or whether I'm just bored or frustrated. Since I've been bored or frustrated most of the time since age 6&#8212;but rarely truly hungry&#8212;is it any wonder that I can't tell the difference?
</p>

<h3 class="title">Yesterday's News</h3>

<p>
Got up extra early this morning so I could do my step workout and then catch the train to work. I worked out longer than usual, but I still had time to lollygag around the house for a bit. I like doing that in the mornings.
</p>

<p>
I had the car yesterday, so I listened to NPR's war coverage on the drive home. I'd like to revise my earlier statement that NPR was no better than the television news stations; it turns out the lack of boring B-roll and computer simulations really makes a difference. Add in Scott Simon's soothing voice, and it's bearable for at least 15 minutes at a time (unlike the news networks, which I can't watch for more than 2 or 3). One thing that struck me, however, as Simon interviewed correspondent after correspondent about what was happening in his or her area, was that these individuals obviously weren't listening to the reports of their colleagues. All the correspondents breathlessly reported what they thought was news, not realizing that the correspondents before them had just said the same thing. I guess that's to be expected when you're "embedded" in an army unit out in the middle of the Iraqi desert, but it's still a mix of tedious and ridiculous when you're listening on the drive home.

<p>
My list of regularly-read weblogs is growing. Found <a href="http://journal.cynthiachew.com/" target="a8_win">another woman out there</a> who's on the fence about the war too, for similar reasons. (She's also just plain neat.) She had a link on her site to an <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/03/23/do2305.xml&sSheet=/opinion/2003/03/23/ixop.html" target="a8_win">interesting article</a> about a guy who went to Iraq to become a human shield without really understanding what he was doing.
</p>

<p>
This, at the same time that I've lost any sympathy I might have had for anti-war protestors in San Francisco. It seems the social terrorists have moved on from <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/03/21/MN106172.DTL" target="a8_win">blocking streets and assaulting commuters to staging vomit-ins</a>. (I do admit I have some sympathy for the knitters, even though crocheting is my blanket-making method of choice.)
</p>

<p>
In other news, my friend Heather discoverd a few years ago, when she started <a href="http://www.jezebel.com/mirror/" target="a8_win">Jezebel's Mirror</a> (and later Friends of Jezebel's Mirror), that she wasn't the only one who had a penchant for taking self-portraits in mirrors. (I think we all think we're the only ones who are doing it; like Heather, I had zillions of prints of me taken in various reflective surfaces over the years&#8212;and this was before I got a digital camera!&#8212;but I didn't realize that everyone else did, too.) FOJM eventually blossomed into the Mirror Project, and it has only increased in popularity since... which brings us to the present dilemma: the current MP servers can't handle the load. Please consider <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/fundingdrive/" target="a8_win">making a donation</a> (no amount too small!) so the narcissism-as-art can continue. And while you're at it, <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/submit/" target="a8_win">submit a photo</a>. C'mon, you know you've got one.

<h3 class="title">Why Bunny?</h3>

<p>
I chose "bunny" for today's webcam caption, and my husband just asked me why. "Bunny hair," I replied. This doesn't make much sense to anyone I say it to, but whenever I dye my hair pale pink, I refer to it as "bunny pink" or just "bunny hair." The reason is that when I was 5 (or 3? or 1?), I got a pink stuffed rabbit for Easter. Ever since, I've associated that pale pink color with bunnies, even though I've never met an actual bunny that's pale pink.
</p>

<p>
I think my mom might still have that bunny at her house, actually. If she does, I'll take a photo of it next time I'm there. It probably looks pretty sad now (though, to be honest, it looked pretty sad the last time I remember seeing it, which was about 15 years ago). Mom sewed on buttons to replace the eyes it lost over the years, and she mentioned once that its ears had stood up when she and dad bought it for me, though they drooped within a year. This was a shock to me, as I'd thought its ears had always drooped.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to remember if I'm remembering actually finding the rabbit where the Easter Bunny had hidden it (in a wicker ottoman we used to have), or whether I'm remembering the photograph of me finding it...

<h3 class="title">BoF***Yourself</h3>

<p>
Just got off the phone with <a href="http://www.bofa.com/" target="a8_win">BofA</a> Customer Service. Or maybe it was Quicken Customer Service&#8212;I'm not sure. Al asked me to get a Quicken PIN number so he could download my statements (he's the financial record-keeper in our family), so I called the BofA number. It wasn't clear from the menu options what I needed to do, so I pressed 4 for "if you need help with something else...." When I said I needed a Quicken PIN number, the chap on the other end of the phone said, "I'm going to transfer you to a Quicken representative. May I put you on hold?" He was nice enough about it, but I could tell from the tone of his voice that I should have pressed 3 for "if you're having trouble with Quicken...."
</p>

<p>
The Quicken representative I was connected with approximately 90 seconds later didn't seem to know anything about me, so I guess typing in my account number was only for BofA's benefit. I had to tell him what state I was in, give him my checking account number, my mother's maiden name, the state I was born in, and my date of birth. All the spam scam alarms were going off in my head, but I fought them down. The rep then asked if I wanted to have the service where I downloaded my statements from the website, or the one where I could open my statements directly from Quicken (which is $9.95/mo, though my super duper account status means that the fee would be waived). I said I didn't know&#8212;it was my husband who wanted the Quicken PIN to begin with. I said I'd ask him, hang on.
</p>

<p>
I typed the question to Al via AIM, and he asked if he could have both. The rep said fine, that he'd updated my account for the premium service, and that it would take 48 hours to process. I said, "ok, so I can download from the website now, but I have to wait 48 hours to open from Quicken?" 
</p>
<p>
"No," he replied. "You need to wait two days for both, or it will get confused."
</p>

<p>
Uh, ok. He started to terminate the call, and I said, "wait, don't I need the PIN?"
</p>

<p>
"Your online banking ID and passcode are the PIN."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, so when I log on to the BofA website, I'm connected? Or do you mean that my online password is my Quicken PIN?"
</p>

<p>
"WHEN YOU OPEN QUICKEN YOU'LL BE PROMPTED FOR YOUR ONLINE BANKING ID AND PASSCODE, AND IT WILL CONNECT AUTOMATICALLY," he practically shouted. Apparently he thought this was obvious. For my part, I thought it was obvious that I wasn't the Quicken user, and that I was only asking for the PIN on my husband's behalf. I guess we were both wrong. :(

<h3 class="title">April Approaches</h3>

<p>
There's a lot to look forward to in April: Daylight Savings Time, a new hockey season, the Easter Bunny's arrival, warmer weather, blooming flowers.... Unfortunately, to get to all those good things, we have to enter April via its first official day, otherwise known as April Fool's Day. Oh, how I loathe April Fool's Day.
</p>

<p>
It's not so much that I don't have a sense of humor (I do, really!); it's that I don't find practical jokes particularly funny, and I don't appreciate being lied to. These seem to be the hallmarks of any successful April Fool's Day. My father seemed to look forward to April 1 every year, though specific memories of tortuous April Fool's breakfasts with him only date back to my pre-teen years, when my sister and I got up early enough for school that we would see him before he left for work. His cousin Ducky, who was in perpetual tease-the-kids-with-lies-and-practical-jokes mode, seemed to regard the day as something of a national holiday. Ducky's own kids seemed to roll with it, but I was always demanding exasperatedly that he just tell me the truth, which is probably where the rumor that I have no sense of humor started.
</p>

<p>
My hatred of April Fool's Day pre-dates The Great April Fool's Debacle of 1980, but certainly that incident cemented April 1 as a day of infamy, a day to call in sick, a day to avoid contact with other humans if at all possible. The story goes like this: I'd woken up that morning with an impression so strong I can only call it a premonition. It wasn't like hearing a voice so much as having a message stamped clearly on my brain: KIM AND LAVINIA WILL PRETEND TO BE YOUR FRIENDS TODAY. IT'S AN APRIL FOOL'S JOKE. DO NOT BE FOOLED. Wow, I thought. I will be *totally* prepared for their shenanigans!
</p>

<p>
At recess that day, another girl from our class approached me and said, "Kim and Lavinia want you to come play with them." I was wary, and said no thanks. She kept insisting, however, so I finally went over, prepared to call their bluff. Kim and Lavinia seemed a bit reserved at first, too, but then we got sucked into some game of pretend or another, and I forgot all about being wary. We played together for the remainder of recess, and then on the way back up the hill to our classroom, Kim and Lavinia started telling stories. I remember Lavinia telling one about a particularly large crap that she had taken, which was odd for a relatively prim 6th grader in those days. I was a bit shocked, and tried to come up with a more appropriate word for the one she was using ("shit", I believe), when they stopped me short.
</p>

<p>
"Lori, I don't know how to tell you this," said Kim. "But all this has been a practical joke. We don't like you at all!" "April Fool's!" they squealed as they ran up the path ahead of me, leaving me standing there, completely dumbstruck. I finally yelled after them, "I know! I knew that! I knew it was just a joke!", but it was too late. Who would believe I'd had a premonition that this very thing would happen? And who *wouldn't* believe me a fool for falling for it anyway?
</p>

<p>
OK, so maybe I hate April Fool's Day because, as a fool, I take it on the chin on April 1. I prefer to think of myself as someone with an overdeveloped sense of justice, and ok, possibly, an underdeveloped sense of humor. Whichever you think of as the greater handicap, please keep it in mind and take pity on me tomorrow. No practical jokes, please.
</p>
