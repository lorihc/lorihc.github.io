<h3 class="title">Why Bunny?</h3>

<p>
I chose "bunny" for today's webcam caption, and my husband just asked me why. "Bunny hair," I replied. This doesn't make much sense to anyone I say it to, but whenever I dye my hair pale pink, I refer to it as "bunny pink" or just "bunny hair." The reason is that when I was 5 (or 3? or 1?), I got a pink stuffed rabbit for Easter. Ever since, I've associated that pale pink color with bunnies, even though I've never met an actual bunny that's pale pink.
</p>

<p>
I think my mom might still have that bunny at her house, actually. If she does, I'll take a photo of it next time I'm there. It probably looks pretty sad now (though, to be honest, it looked pretty sad the last time I remember seeing it, which was about 15 years ago). Mom sewed on buttons to replace the eyes it lost over the years, and she mentioned once that its ears had stood up when she and dad bought it for me, though they drooped within a year. This was a shock to me, as I'd thought its ears had always drooped.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to remember if I'm remembering actually finding the rabbit where the Easter Bunny had hidden it (in a wicker ottoman we used to have), or whether I'm remembering the photograph of me finding it...
