<h3 class="title">Limbo is Not for Lori</h3>

<p>
I was talking to my mom on the phone last night about how lately I seem to be suffering from Weekend Depression, and how I haven't been looking forward to Cleaning Night as I used to (in fact, I'm dreading it these days). I speculated that the two phenomena might have something in common, since they started at around the same time, and both seem to stem from resentment of the Mountain View house. I think that now that I've given up my house in Truckee, I'm feeling a little stuck in Mountain View. I know that eventually Al & I will buy a new house together, and I'm excited about that prospect: it's why I didn't feel sad about putting my house on the market. I knew it was paving the way for something new and different and better. The problem is that I can't wait for the new, different, and better thing to come. As mom observed, "you'll take heaven or hell, but you can't stand limbo."
