<h3 class="title">And Now a Word on Eating</h3>

<p>
Funny where you get when you hop around the web. I started at <a href="http://www.loobylu.com/" target="a8_win">Loobylu</a> this morning, then jumped from there to <a href="http://www.frenchtoastgirl.com/weblog/blogger.shtml" target="a8_win">French Toast Girl</a>, where I saw a link to <a href="http://iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=5&art_id=ct2003031620212555L130494&set_id=9" target="a8_win">a diet that involved eating everything with chopsticks</a>. The description of it reminded me of a book I read back in the mid-90s called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449003825/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Overcoming Overeating</a>. I totally understood the principles, but it was really hard to let go and surround myself with food, to trust that eventually I'd stop wanting to eat everything if I realized I could have whatever I wanted whenever I wanted it.
</p>

<p>
Lately I've been following a modified <a href="http://www.atkinscenter.com/" target="a8_win">Atkins</a> plan. I didn't start with Induction (where you eat as much meat as you want and only 3 cups of salad greens a day for at least two weeks) because I only have about 10 pounds to lose, and because Induction is difficult for a semi-vegetarian (I eat fish). I lost about 4 pounds at first, but lately I've been bouncing around in that 4-pound range. Some days at the top, where I started, and some days closer to the bottom. So for weight loss, apparently I have to be more diligent about counting my carbs. The best thing about this plan is that I've managed to kick my addiction to candy and baked goods. I don't worry too much about small amounts of sugar in my foods, and I eat diabetic-friendly chocolate (sweetened with maltitol or sucralose), but I've cut out the overt sugars that used to make up the majority of my daily calorie intake.
</p>

<p>
Getting rid of sugar is great, but I've never really been able to get a grip on eating normal quantities of food. I like to eat things one-after-the-other too much. It seems almost impossible for me *not* to eat while I'm working, too. It's something to do when I'm stuck. I'm not sure that chopsticks will slow me down all that much, either, since I'm fairly proficient with them (Al's Korean relatives were impressed; they had been prepared to offer me a fork until they saw me tackle my sushi and soba noodles like a native). I've tried banning food from my cube, but that goes out the window during crunch times.
</p>

<p>
The trick for me really is determining whether I'm hungry, or whether I'm just bored or frustrated. Since I've been bored or frustrated most of the time since age 6&#8212;but rarely truly hungry&#8212;is it any wonder that I can't tell the difference?
