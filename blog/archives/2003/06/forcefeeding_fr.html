<p>
Ooooh, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/20/international/europe/20TRAD.html?th" target="a8_win">this</a> makes me so MAD!! Everyone keeps talking about the lack of adverse health effects of genetically-modified foods, when they should be talking about their impact on the diversity of ecosystems. GMOs are a global environmental issue, not an immediate-term health issue. I also find the idea that Europe is boycotting American biotech foods because they disagree with the Bush administration's policies in Iraq ridiculous. Europe is rightly suspicious of <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/monsanto/layout/investor/default.asp" target="a8_win">American companies</a>' efforts to control the world's food supply, and they've always been more environmentally conscious than the U.S. as a whole. Europe's stance on GMOs hasn't changed. If this dispute has any connection to Iraq, it's that invading Iraq seems to have made the Bush administration more confident that it can bully the rest of the world to get what it wants.
