Did you say "Potter in here?" That's right, the new Harry Potter book is coming out this weekend; my copy from Amazon should be arriving on my doorstep sometime on Saturday. All my plans for listening to the audio CDs as a refresher before tackling the new tome have gone to hell amidst a crazy work schedule, so I'll have to rely on my sister to pick up all the references to tidbits dropped in the first four books. A few links to news of the Potter mania:

<p>Yes, I caught that story in the NYT on climate change. Interesting, isn't it? </p>

<p>I think if I was on the EPA team that compiled the report I would be pretty annoyed at the fact that half the work I did was excluded. But then I understand the EPA side of the argument, that it's best to just not include the section, rather than have the whole report qualified by the fact that your "global warming" section is supect. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, I'm always amazed at the White House's ability to control information. Whether it's healthy or not for the public (and it's obviously not), you've got to admire their stamina in their ability to control messages.</p>

<p>So true! I agree that I'd rather remove the paragraph than have its inclusion invalidate the rest of the report, and I too am amazed at the Bush administration's ability to control info. What I find even odder is that there's so little uproar over it.</p>

<p>(Just realized that the "it" is a bit ambiguous there... I intended to refer to the Bush administration's information management techniques, but the comment could as easily apply to the EPA report.)</p>
