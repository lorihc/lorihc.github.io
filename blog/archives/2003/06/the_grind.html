<h3 class="title">The Grind</h3>

<p>
My right hip is grinding a bit today. It was sore after last night's hockey game for no reason I can discern, and it definitely ached during my step workout this morning. Now the gnashing is unignorable. Wonder what's up?
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I've been extremely busy at work; so much so that I've barely written in any of my blogs for over a week. When you're too busy to blog during working hours, and you're spending some of your leisure hours working, you don't exactly want to flip open the laptop when you do have a chance to walk away. Or at least I don't, anyway. I've been spending most of my non-work time sketching and painting (thanks to my 7 year-old niece for getting me back into watercolors&#8212;I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed them), going to the horse races (the spring meet at Bay Meadows ends this weekend, sadly), working out, and playing golf.
</p>

<p>
Re: the golf, I'm not very good at it, and for a while wasn't enjoying it at all, but it seems to be growing on me again. My mom gave me her old Big Bertha driver a few weeks ago, and my discomfort with woods is starting to fade. I'd still rather hit irons, but I'm learning to suck it up and hit the driver off the tee on any hole longer than 300 yards, which is a start. I'll never get comfortable with woods unless I can learn to use them in an actual round and not just at the driving range. And, truth be told, I *can* hit the ball farther with the driver than I can with my 3-iron (or even my 2). Now I just need to figure out how to hit it straight...
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the good golf news isn't so much the driver as it is the fact that I've been leaving the course wanting to play another round, rather than feeling so frustrated that I never want to play again. I'm hoping to be able to get up early some weekday morning soon and play the back 9 at Palo Alto with my husband. (That's what we did on Saturday, but weekends are more crowded than weekdays, for obvious reasons.)
</p>

<p>
On the workout front, I seem to be making some progress at the gym, as I'm starting to see (and feel) muscles where they were never detectable before. I'm glad we're not going tonight (Monday-Wednesday-Friday is our usual schedule, though if we have a hockey game on Monday we'll go on Sunday instead), given the grind in my hip and the grit in my eyes, but I find I look forward to the gym trips more often than not. It's a little intimidating (and often annoying) to be stared at so much (not, I assure you, for my good looks or fine physique, but rather, I suspect, for my minority gender), but it's the price I pay, I guess, for an inexpensive, no-nonsense, weight-centric gym.
</p>

<p>
OK, both my builds are done, and there are many bugs on my plate, so it's back to the grind. Ouch!

<p>My grandfather was an avid golfer. Having supported a family through the depression he couldn't pass up a bargain. He went out golfing once when he came to visit us in Kentucky. It began raining in the early morning when he left and it rained all day. He didn't come home til 8PM. He said he couldn't resist golfing without paying green fees.</p>

<p>Take care of that hip.</p>

<p>:) We once played in a downpour at Disney World, but finally gave up after about 16 holes when the water started running down our legs and into our shoes. And this was from *inside* the golf cart.</p>

<p>I wish you would write about something else besides yourself, Al, ice hockey, golfing, and working out. As I do not know you, I do not find it very interesting that you gained a new ripple of muscle. It would be more interesting if you wrote about things of more substance, like someone you know who is interesting and you admire or something in the world that interests you. <br />
You live a very upscale life with two houses and golf and expensive ice hockey equipment. I have never seen you write how lucky you feel for this lifestyle. Is it that you take it for granted?</p>

<p>lori,</p>

<p>i wish you'd make a ham and cheese sandwich for me. i don't know how to make one, nor am i interested in learning how you're going to make it. i can't even afford a ham and cheese sandwich, really, but i'm sure you could at least share how grateful you are that you can make one for me. please use the expensive ham and the good cheese, so you'll feel like you're making a real contribution to my life.</p>

<p>OK, now THAT's funny! while you're at it, I could use a ham & cheese as well. I need to pack on the pounds or else I'm gonna keep getting muscled off the puck!</p>
