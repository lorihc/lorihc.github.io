<h3 class="title">The Grind</h3>

<p>
My right hip is grinding a bit today. It was sore after last night's hockey game for no reason I can discern, and it definitely ached during my step workout this morning. Now the gnashing is unignorable. Wonder what's up?
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I've been extremely busy at work; so much so that I've barely written in any of my blogs for over a week. When you're too busy to blog during working hours, and you're spending some of your leisure hours working, you don't exactly want to flip open the laptop when you do have a chance to walk away. Or at least I don't, anyway. I've been spending most of my non-work time sketching and painting (thanks to my 7 year-old niece for getting me back into watercolors&#8212;I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed them), going to the horse races (the spring meet at Bay Meadows ends this weekend, sadly), working out, and playing golf.
</p>

<p>
Re: the golf, I'm not very good at it, and for a while wasn't enjoying it at all, but it seems to be growing on me again. My mom gave me her old Big Bertha driver a few weeks ago, and my discomfort with woods is starting to fade. I'd still rather hit irons, but I'm learning to suck it up and hit the driver off the tee on any hole longer than 300 yards, which is a start. I'll never get comfortable with woods unless I can learn to use them in an actual round and not just at the driving range. And, truth be told, I *can* hit the ball farther with the driver than I can with my 3-iron (or even my 2). Now I just need to figure out how to hit it straight...
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the good golf news isn't so much the driver as it is the fact that I've been leaving the course wanting to play another round, rather than feeling so frustrated that I never want to play again. I'm hoping to be able to get up early some weekday morning soon and play the back 9 at Palo Alto with my husband. (That's what we did on Saturday, but weekends are more crowded than weekdays, for obvious reasons.)
</p>

<p>
On the workout front, I seem to be making some progress at the gym, as I'm starting to see (and feel) muscles where they were never dectable before. I'm glad we're not going tonight (Monday-Wednesday-Friday is our usual schedule, though if we have a hockey game on Monday we'll go on Sunday instead), given the grind in my hip and the grit in my eyes, but I find I look forward to the gym trips more often than not. It's a little intimidating (and often annoying) to be stared at so much (not, I assure you, for my good looks or fine physique, but rather, I suspect, for my minority gender), but it's the price I pay, I guess, for an inexpensive, no-nonsense, weight-centric gym.
</p>

<p>
OK, both my builds are done, and there are many bugs on my plate, so it's back to the grind. Ouch!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Mornings with Martha</h3>

<p>
As my friend Hoche reflected the other night, it's easier to shift your schedule later (as in, get up later in the morning, stay up later at night) than it is to shift it earlier. It's so true: as much as I love early mornings, when no one else is up except the birds and the first rays of sun, I am finding it hard to drag myself out of bed before 8:30 these days (and sometimes I dally and doze until well after 9). This is due more to work than late-night hockey games; I've been staying up past midnight (and earlier this week, past 3am) most nights trying to get on top of my buglist.
</p>

<p>
The benefit that I've found in getting up later in the mornings is that I'm still in the house (usually getting dressed and putting on makeup) when Martha Stewart Living is on. She's a little over-the-top for me, but that just means that I can actually continue with my morning routine while she raves about "very, very delicious" peach cobbers and "absolutely stunning" flower arrangements instead of just standing there glued to the TV. I bustle while she gushes, and occasionally I run back to the bedroom to get a recipe or a gardening tip.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday I just listened from the bathroom to the recipes for fruit sherbet and homemade ice cream cones (courtesy of guest Alice Waters), and this morning I got some tips on what to do with those scary green leaves sprouting up relentlessly in one corner of our garden (use them to frame a rhododendron arrangement). I tuned out the rose-pruning demonstration, since Al does the rose pruning at our (only) house, but I made sure to note the instructions for making fresh chicken tacos at home, in case we ever move away from California and have to make our own Mexican food. I can't wait for tomorrow's "Cookie of the Week" segment; lemon sandwich cookies aren't my favorite, but I love to bake, so I'm a sucker for cookie recipes of all kinds.
</p>

<p>
Alas, there have been no segments recently on how to make ham sandwiches.
</p>

Did you say "Potter in here?" That's right, the new Harry Potter book is coming out this weekend; my copy from Amazon should be arriving on my doorstep sometime on Saturday. All my plans for listening to the audio CDs as a refresher before tackling the new tome have gone to hell amidst a crazy work schedule, so I'll have to rely on my sister to pick up all the references to tidbits dropped in the first four books. A few links to news of the Potter mania:

<p>
Ooooh, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/20/international/europe/20TRAD.html?th" target="a8_win">this</a> makes me so MAD!! Everyone keeps talking about the lack of adverse health effects of genetically-modified foods, when they should be talking about their impact on the diversity of ecosystems. GMOs are a global environmental issue, not an immediate-term health issue. I also find the idea that Europe is boycotting American biotech foods because they disagree with the Bush administration's policies in Iraq ridiculous. Europe is rightly suspicious of <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/monsanto/layout/investor/default.asp" target="a8_win">American companies</a>' efforts to control the world's food supply, and they've always been more environmentally conscious than the U.S. as a whole. Europe's stance on GMOs hasn't changed. If this dispute has any connection to Iraq, it's that invading Iraq seems to have made the Bush administration more confident that it can bully the rest of the world to get what it wants.
