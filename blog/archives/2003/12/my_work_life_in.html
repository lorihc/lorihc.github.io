<h3 class="title">My (Work) Life, In Boxes</h3>

<p>
I'm unpacking and sorting through my office boxes today. It's so weird to look through old notebooks, e-mails, calendars and other random bits of detritus from seven years (and several cubes) at Macromedia. I have logs of how I spent my time when I was in developer support, lists of bugs I'd filed or intended to file, meeting notes, half-written articles for the developer center, copies of my tech review of the Dreamweaver 4 API documentation (complete with angry notes in the margins, like "IT'S A BOOLEAN!" and "Code blocks are not separate from the runtime code&#8212;they <u>ARE</u> the runtime code!!"), postcards from vacationing friends and co-workers, conference swag, boxed copies of every release of Dreamweaver, and every manual I ever wrote or read. I'm saving a few small things for my scrapbook and some of the API manuals as writing samples, but the rest has to go&#8212;there's no room for it in my house or my life.
</p>

<p>
This is just the start of a big day of weeding; I wouldn't be surprised if a few more <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2003/07/georgia_on_my_m.html">photos of t-shirts</a> and other memorabilia showed up here, so that I can part with the objects themselves without regret.

<p>Hey, if you want to get rid of those boxed copies of DW, let me have them :)  I'm missing a couple of releases in my collection...</p>

<p>Oh, should have mentioned that I'm keeping the boxed copies of Dreamweaver, too. I know there's probably no use for them, but I'm proud of having been part of the process. Though to be honest, if I were really proud of the *boxes*, I'd find a way to display them rather than leaving them stuffed in a moving crate... At least, that's what they always say on Clean Sweep.</p>
