<h3 class="title">Let it Snow!</h3>

<p>
<a href="/blog/images/snowing_1205.html" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('/blog/images/snowing_1205.html','snowday','menubar=yes,width=405,height=540');return false;"><img src="/blog/images/snowing_1205_tb.jpg" width="120" height="120" alt="let it snow" class="inline-right"></a>While walking to the K-Mart at lunch on Tuesday I experienced a snow squall. From the description of lake-effect snow on the Weather Channel that morning, I'd have sworn that's what it was&#8212;except that we don't live near the Great Lakes. Is it possible it was river-effect snow, since we live between the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers?
</p>

<p>
In any case, that little squall&#8212;bounded on both sides by sunshine&#8212;was only an appetizer. It's now snowing for real outside. The forecast for today through Sunday is "wintry mix and wind". There's no mixing right now, though: All I see is giant, swirling, coming-down-like-crazy snowflakes. Judging from the fact that they occasionally seem to be falling sideways, I'd say the wind part was right.
</p>

<p>
I have a workout to complete, a bathroom to paint, a tree to decorate, and Christmas cards to write, but there's no way I'm not going out in this. It better still be snowing by the time I get all my outerwear on; walking to the Starbucks in the snow is the perfect way to get in the Christmas spirit, I'd say. Today might be the day I finally splurge on a Peppermint Mocha.
