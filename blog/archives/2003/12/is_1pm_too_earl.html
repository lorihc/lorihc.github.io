<h3 class="title">Is 1pm Too Early for Cocktails?</h3>

<p>
I've been watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032143/" target="a8_win">The Women</a> while working on my websites and in between rushing down to take photos of the kitchen remodel, and I'm starting to crave cocktails. Everybody drank like fish in movies from the 30s and 40s, and they looked so elegant doing it that it makes me want to dig through our boxes to find the giant martini glasses I got for my 30th birthday. Although now that I think of it, I gave away all our liquor before the move so it wouldn't spill in the boxes.... 
</p>

<p>
My sister gave me a bottle of Bailey's for Christmas, but I want a *real* cocktail, not dessert. Hmmm. Oh! I know: our contractor gave us a bottle of cranberry mash yesterday (it's apparently a cranberry-vodka liqueur); maybe I can make something out of that... though what I really want is a Sidecar or a Lemon Drop. Given that I have no vodka, brandy, lemon juice, or triple sec, I'm probably safe (for now) from becoming an afternoon drunk.

<p>heh. I was just watching "After The Thin Man" the other day. I think that if you're going to drink cocktails every night you need to get a ballroom gown and Al needs to wear a tux.</p>

<p>If I'm going to do it, I also need someone to write snappy dialog for me. A soundtrack would be good too.</p>

<p>I *love* the Thin Man (I've got the original and Shadow of the Thin Man), and it's probably the best example of a movie that will incite me to drink. There's a scene in the original where Nora comes into a bar/ballroom and finds Nick already soused. She asks how many he's had, and, deciding she needs to catch up, asks the waiter to bring her six martinis -- "just line them up right here." :) </p>

<p>I do have a ball gown, and I've been looking for an excuse to wear it. Maybe I'll pull it out after lunch one day and mix myself a Manhattan!</p>
