<h3 class="title">The Days of DMs are Over</h3>

<p>
News flash: <a href="http://www.dansko.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&tabid=63&StyleName=Professional&ID1=306&ID2=050202&PageID=2" target="a8_win">Dansko clogs</a> have replaced Doc Martens as my comfort shoe of choice. Is this a consequence of turning 35, or just coincidence? Your guess is as good as mine. I hung on to my fuchsia DMs through seven moves, but as I've only worn them once in the past five years, I've moved them to the <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/cleansweep/cleansweep.html" target="a8_win">Sell pile</a> (which is really the give-away-to-charity pile, since I doubt I'll get around to selling anything). I'm considering getting a pair of plum nubuck closed-back clogs to replace them. 
</p>

<p>
At one point I had 11 pairs of DMs, but I've been slowly whittling that number down over the years. My second pair&#8212;a set of shiny black shoes&#8212;was the first to go, when the leather in the heels cracked and split open. They were loved too well. A couple pairs that didn't fit as well as they should have&#8212;and thus were loved too little&#8212;were given away in practically-new condition. I've clung to my remaining 6 or 7 pairs as if giving them up would mean finally admitting that I'm uncool, but alas, it's time for my green distressed-leather 8-eyes, my green distressed-leather shoes, my brown oiled leather 8-eyes, and my matte black leather steel-toed 8-eyes&#8212;my first pair ever, purchased in London&#8212;to join the fuchsia pair in the Sell pile. I'm keeping the shiny black 10-eyes for now, though the skirts I usually wear them with will probably look just as nice with the Danskos.
</p>

<p>
In the "but wait, I'm still punk!" department, I got my hair cut last week. After two years of cutting it myself, I finally made it back to Toni Kim's chair at Hugo Salon in Wheaton, MD, and she gave me a right proper shearing. I now have super-short, stand-on-end, spiked-like-I-like it hair that's screaming for Manic Panic purple dye. Even my Korean mother-in-law calls it "very modern." Yeah, baby!
