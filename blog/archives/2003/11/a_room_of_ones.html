<p>
I haven't been keeping up with my blog lately, partly because I've been working, partly because I've been painting, and partly because we haven't gotten the wireless network set up in our new house yet, and he cable modem is in the basement with zillions of boxes.

Al and I managed to paint the storage room (Holly Berry red) before the movers arrived; since the move, I've done the master bathroom and my office/workroom. I wanted to get the latter done as soon as possible so I could move the furniture into place and have a sanctuary, a place to retreat when the unpacking overwhelmed me.
