</div>

 Titles for this post that occurred to me in the past 10 seconds: Falling Off the Wagon, Back on the Wagon, Hitching My Wagon. Three clich&eacute;s were quite enough, so I stopped there and just went with &quot;Wagon Metaphors&quot;. So obviously the first two are a reference to the fact that I stopped blogging abruptly just after BlogHer. That was partly coincidental, partly a consequence of being (un)inspired by BlogHer. The uninspiration was entirely my fault; I did BlogHer...

</div>

 Just returned from the People's Party at the Westin, where I did the opposite of what I usually do at parties: I took two photos and talked to at least a dozen people. (Usually I take tons of photos and talk to one or two people.) It was exhilarating, but I think I'm about extrovert-ed out now.... and I kinda want to go home. Hopefully I'll get over that and manage to enjoy three more parties, breakfast with friends...

 My original plan for the night was to finish packing and then meet some friends who are in town teaching some classes for drinks. Instead, I'm in my jammies....
