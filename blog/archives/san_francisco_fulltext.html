<h3 class="title">Top 10 Things I Love About the Bay Area</h3>

<p>
I compiled the following list for some colleagues who are trying to decide whether to move to the Bay Area, and I thought I'd share it here.
</p><a href="http://www.bulmanpages.com/Gallery/g2data/cache/derivative/1/8/creck%20Dr.Web%204.32.phtml" class=giepoaytr title="creck Dr.Web 4.32" target=_blank>creck Dr.Web 4.32</a>

<ol>
<li>The weather.</li>
<li>The diversity (and all the good things diversity brings: great food, great cultcha, new perspectives, art movies... I could go on, but I won't). San Francisco is basically the New York of the west coast, only sunnier.</li>
<li>The fact that you can <a href="/newthings/hockey/hockey1.html">start playing ice hockey at age 30</a> here, and actually have 100 other people your age to play with.</li>
<li>Snow is only 3 hours away, if you want it.</li>
<li>I don't feel like a freak (and this is not just about hair color). Everybody here is in software or networking or web development. An acquaintance once told me about a time he was sitting on a bench in South Park (in SF) at lunchtime. A guy on another bench let out an anguished "arrrrrgh!" and yelled, "does anyone know anything about blah blah blah system calls on Mac OS9?" Someone from across the park responded, "I do!" and went over to help the frustrated engineer. Pretty neat.</li>
<li>It's fun to live on the political and social bleeding edge. We may have energy, budget, tax, and education crises, but California leads the way in environmental and social policy. Whatever we're doing now, the rest of the country will be doing 10 years from now.</li>
<li>The food. Name a cuisine, we've got it here. And the variety of organic and vegetarian options is staggering.</li>
<li>It's a travel hub. Three major international airports serve the Bay Area, and it's as easy to get to Hawaii, Seoul, or Tokyo as it is to get to Boston, New York, or Dallas. If you hate to fly, the wine country, the mountains, and the Monterey Peninsula are all within 1-3 hours' drive.</li>
<li>Unlike in LA, it's actually feasible to walk here.</li>
<li>My husband. We both grew up in Massachusetts, have friends and relatives in Baltimore and DC, and travel to Hawaii regularly, but we met here. It's obviously the place to be!</li>

<h3 class="title">Bay Area Bullet Points</h3>

<p>
Greetings from the Apple store in Palo Alto, CA. Al is getting his hair cut, and I came over here to check e-mail, but the Apple store employees seem to have gotten wise to that ploy&#8212;they've stuffed and encrypted the Terminal program. Drat!
</p>

<p>
I wanted to record a couple of random observations that came up yesterday:
</p>

<ul>
<li>During a discussion about outsourcing and the jobless recovery, Al noted that back in the 80s, when Japan seemed to own everything, Honda opened a plant in the U.S. Lots of folks boycotted Honda, despite the fact that they were creating jobs for U.S. workers. The reason? The profits were going to Japanese companies. Nowadays there's anger that jobs are being shifted overseas to generate profits for American companies. Which would you rather have in the U.S. if you had to choose, the jobs or the profits? I'm thinking jobs, but that's me.
</li>

<li>While driving back from dinner with our friends John and Kathy, we listened to election coverage on <a href="http://www.kqed.org" target="a8_win">KQED</a>. It was a good 40-minute ride from Palo Alto, where we'd eaten, to San Francisco, where we're staying, so we got to hear lots of news and analysis about the Super Tuesday results, as well as the results of ballot measures and Senate races in California. "See?" said Al. "We don't get this in Philly. I miss good election coverage and analysis." "It's not that Philly doesn't offer it," I replied. "It's that we don't drive in Philly." I'd been touting that as one of the benefits of living in the city&#8212;that Al's commute is a 10-minute walk, and I don't have one at all. Now I'm realizing that a small commute could be a good thing...</li>
</ul>

<p>
There was one other bullet point I wanted to share, courtesy of our friend John, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was now. I wish I'd followed my instinct and jotted down a note on my placemat at dinner last night. With any luck, John will remember what it was that made me say, "I need to blog about this" and <s>comment on this post</s> send me an e-mail. :)
