 Hello from Monroeville (Pittsburgh)! I decided to give my fingers a rest for a couple days after the last long missive, so I'm writing one leg away from home. On Thursday we left at 8am in brisk, 36 degree weather for the GM Assembly Plant in Flint, MI. It took a little less than an hour and a half to get there, but the drive was uneventful. We'd yet to figure out what direction people commute in in the...

 Hi Mom and Lisa We finished up day 3 with a drive out to a Whole Foods in Troy, during which we learned the significance of the title of the movie about Eminem's life, 8 Mile. The streets are essentially mile markers, so there's a 7 Mile and a 9 Mile and so on (Whole Foods was at 14 Mile). It wasn't a grammar error on Eminem's part to leave off an 's'; apparently 8 Mile was a dividing...

 Hello from the Dearborn truck plant! Today we are visiting the Henry Ford Museum and doing the Rouge Factory Tour. We decided to do the tour first, so we took a shuttle bus over here to the Rouge facility, saw a movie about the history of the Rouge plant and Henry Ford's contributions to modern manufacturing, and then spent an hour looking over the F-150 assembly line. It was so very cool to watch trucks being built! A few...

 Hello A brief synopsis of the first day of our road trip: We love our new car! It's perfect for long trips -- very comfortable, and effortless to drive. We headed for a spot south of Pittsburgh: Fallingwater, one of Frank Lloyd Wright's more famous architectural achievements. We took the tour of the house and also visited the gift shop, where we found a clock that we immediately agreed was a perfect fit for our mantle. The weather was...
