 I mentioned that there would be an upcoming post with Annie photos; this is it. A couple weeks before she died, I had the idea to create a catalog of Annie's various poses and positions and our names for them. It was something I figured I'd work on eventually; I didn't realize then that I wouldn't have time to take pictures of any as-yet-unphotographed poses. In going through all our Annie photos to work through our grief and create...

 Annie lost her battle with cancer yesterday, and I haven't been able to gather my wits enough to blog. Please bear with me while I work through the grief; normal programming will resume shortly. Thanks....

 Yesterday afternoon I took our cat, Annie, to the vet. She's been coughing for about a week (like cats do when they're trying to eject a hairball, but no hairballs ever came out), and she started eating about half as much food as she normally does (very strange for Annie, who is not a self-regulator when it comes to food). I figured she might have bronchitis or even pneumonia, since she was acting like I do when I get...

 I think Annie is trying to warm us up for parenthood. Actually, she's been doing this to me ever since I moved in with Al three years ago. It was a giant step for me to become a pet owner, to know that I was responsible for feeding and watering and caring for another creature. As I bonded with Annie and got up to feed her in the morning and took her to the vet for checkups and shots,...

 Greetings from the Borders at Chestnut and Broad in Philadelphia, where I've stopped to check e-mail and upload a couple about town II photos. (Speaking of photos, one of my photos of some interesting urban textures I noticed at the San Carlos Caltrain station was posted on Lalaland on Saturday. Fitting, as it was our last day in California!) Al, Annie, and I all survived the move intact, though for Annie especially it was a bit stressful. She'd never...

 We put an offer on a house in Philadelphia today. I don't want to say much about it here yet, for fear of jinxing it, but we're very excited. I'm really glad I came out for this little house-hunting trip prior to the move (especially as it ended in us making an offer), but now that I'm here, I wish I could stay. I know that there's a bunch of stuff yet to be done in California, and Annie...
