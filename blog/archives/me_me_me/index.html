 Started back at the beginning&#8212;Week 1, Day 1&#8212;of the 10K Runner program on Friday. I probably could have started at week 5, which I usually do after a running break, but after a couple hockey injuries and being sick the week of Christmas, I figured it couldn't hurt to ease my way back in slowly. I did Day 2 this morning and forgot to take my inhaler first, and I was wheezing by the end. Technically the chest cold...

 Played so much bass during last night's adult program practice that by the last song my left hand and arm cramped and refused to grip the strings. In the grand scheme of things it wasn't *that* much continuous playing time&#8212;only a little over 2 hours&#8212;but that's more than I've ever done before. (Usually I practice for 30-60 minutes a night, my lessons are 45 minutes long, and at the last adult session I sang half the songs because I...

 A friend happened to favorite a Flickr photo of mine from 2007 today, which led me to re-read the caption on the photo, which led me to look at the other photos in my stream from around that time, which led me to the photos of our trip to Pittsburgh just after Christmas in 2007. Al asked, "what was the name of the pizza place we went to with Craig, do you remember?" I didn't, but I said that...

 It's been so long since I've written in either of my blogs that I was afraid to even open them for fear they'd been hacked by spammers and were crawling with malware. Tonight I finally got the nerve to take a peek, and found no such thing. Instead, I got caught up in reading old hockey blog posts for a good 30 minutes before coming over here to see what was up....

 Even though nothing spectacularly good happened (in fact, a few things went wrong on the deployment front at work), today felt like a good day. I walked home happy. I got two giant and soothing hugs from the Beaner. I ate a lovely arugula salad and drank a pineapple-banana-Korean pear smoothie for dinner. I finished off some work e-mails, placed a drugstore.com order, uploaded a few photos from the Princeton trip, and now I'm calling it a night. That's...

 Just a quick note to say that I've been thinking, reading, and even writing quite a bit lately; I just haven't been publishing anything (here, at least). I've been watching a LOT of The Wire (Al and I made it to season 4 last night), suffering through some sickness (the Beaner's, the nanny's, and my own), and giving a lot of thought to who I am, what I do, and what I want....

 It's the Beaner's 4th birthday today, and it's a bit of a letdown for him after last weekend's party plus visits from his cousin, both sets of grandparents, another set of cousins, and his great-aunt in the past week. For me I think it's kind of a letdown too, in the sense that my body has apparently given up after all the company and planning and baking and whatnot. I'm tired and sweaty and cold and desperately trying to...

 As regular readers will know, I work at home. I've been working at home since 2004&#8212;first as a contractor, and then, starting in 2006, full-time. One of the conditions under which I took this new job was that I'd continue to work from home. (I already had a job that I really liked and for which I could move back to California if I wanted, and I hadn't done so yet&#8212;so why would I move for a new job...

The dream started en medias res (do all dreams start that way? probably, but in this one, I felt like I'd been dropped into the scene); I was standing on a patch of ground outside a house, and there was a film crew behind me. On the large covered porch of the house were several actors....

At 2:40am on Saturday morning, Al and I were awoken by about six twentysomethings chatting loudly outside our hotel room. Despite two frustrated SHHHes from me and a "dudes! I'm serious! My kid is asleep in here," they didn't shut up until they'd all piled into the room across the hall and gone to sleep themselves....

 I plan to try a few more of these, because any one 30-minute period can't possibly represent my whole day, nor can it reveal how I manage to fit all kinds of activities in (as Heidi asked about in her comment on my last post). This 30-minute period does reveal, however, how short my attention span is.

 I am SO off the (wagon|rails) with my eating.

It's rather unlikely that I'll be at my goal weight...

 If someone suggests that you take an online course, especially one in some type of programming language, please remember to stick to your guns and say NO firmly and unequivocally. Whatever happens, DO NOT CAVE. Your happiness and well-being depends on this....

</div>

 I, like many others, tend to complain when I'm sick but forget to celebrate when I'm healthy. You notice the headache, but not when the headache goes away, as it were. The same is true for my bouts of depression; when I'm low, I know it, and it weighs on me, often dragging me down further. When I'm not, I don't really notice, and I certainly forget to mention it. You can probably guess just from the tenor of...

</div>

 For any of you who were curious, the doctor just called: It was indeed strep throat. Luckily the antibiotics did the trick, and I'm fine now. Just a little lingering goo from the cold/sinus infection that preceded the strep, but that's manageable....

</div>

 I've been really sick for the past few days with what I at first took for strep throat, but which I now think was probably a major sinus infection. The latter makes more sense, as the Beaner had all the same symptoms *except* for the sore throat, and the icky green goo was coming out of his nose instead of going down the back of his throat, as it was in my case....

</div>

 I realized this morning that all the (non-work) projects on my list involve re-designing/re-configuring. Apparently I am in need of change. I want to rearrange my office, get a new chair, and get an L for my current desk so I have actual space for all my computers. Currently my MacBook is up on a pantry rack, both to keep it cool and so that I have space for two mice underneath; my personal laptop is on the too-high-for-a-seated-person...

 So I've been packing on the poundage lately, most likely because (a) I've been depressed, (b) I've been sedentary (well, I *did* start walking daily in August and playing hockey in September, but before that my injured ankle made me less active than usual), and (c) I can't seem to get the pregnancy and nursing nutrition guidelines, wherein fat = good, out of my brain. I haven't been nursing the Beaner since December, 2005, and yet I'm still eating...

 I was saying to a friend today that it feels like for every step forward I take, I take another (bigger?) one backwards. Maybe because I get excited about being happy for a bit, and think it's going to last... and when it doesn't, I'm disappointed in addition to sad. I'm hoping that eventually the steps forward will be bigger than the ones backward. I'm clinging to that....

 So a few weeks ago, when I was in San Francisco (i.e., away from my normal personal laptop with its handy mail filters), I got an e-mail from someone wanting to know if I wanted to help NPR. I deleted the message as spam without reading it. A week later, I got another e-mail with the same subject (prepended this time with Re:)... and from the same sender. This time I decided to check out the headers and maybe...

 So as the caption on this photo explains, the ankle was painful enough on Saturday morning that I returned to crutches for the weekend. I think this was a good choice in any case, because we went down to visit my in-laws, and it's hard to imagine getting around their giant house&#8212;not to mention the stores, driveways, sidewalks, restaurants, and parking lots I had to navigate&#8212;with a bandaged-and-besocked foot sans crutches....

 Every time I have a string of migraines, I resolve to write them down on the calendar to see if I can discern a pattern... and then I don't have one for awhile, and the resolve goes out the window. Sadly, I find myself resolving again today, as this is the third migraine I've had in the past couple months. This one, unlike the other two, is centered in my head, and is more typical of the kind I...

It's not so much the actual injury-causing thing, most times, that's the unbelievable part. It's the HOW of the story that's nutty....

 Last week I called Toppers Spa here in Philadelphia (the one on 19th Street) to make an appointment with my favorite massage therapist, Regina, whom I visit monthly. I've learned that it's impossible to schedule my next month's appointment directly after my massage because Regina's not in the system. (My theory is that they save her for last-minute appointments, based on my experience of being able to get one with her with less than 24 hours' notice.)...

It's bad enough that MouseWorks, the software that drives my beloved Kensington Expert Mouse, conflicts with the Acrobat Connect Add-In (which I need for work). Now Logitech's MouseWare is conflicting with an application that I also need to use for work. In this case it's not causing the application to crash, as MouseWorks caused the Add-In to do, but it's severely...

Unfortunately, "Light to Neutral" turned out to be about 40 shades darker than my actual skin tone, and I didn't realize that drugstore.com guaranteed the color of makeup, so I threw out the packing...

</div>

 Before heading out to Deep Cove (the suggestion of the guy at the front desk) this morning, I took some more photos of the bruise on my butt. I think this one shows the damage pretty well, as well as the migration of the bruise into the previously-swollen area just above my tailbone. I think you can also see the knob pretty clearly, even though this photo was taken head-on (or butt-on, as the case may be...)....

</div>

 It's difficult to show the injury to my butt without mooning the entire Internet (and even harder to photograph your own butt), but I think I've got something that's cropped enough to show some of the damage without violating any obscenity laws. Because of the cropping, it's hard to tell the relative size and position of the injury, so I'll do my best to describe it. The bruising you see is in a sling-like shape under the knob. In...

 I fell down the stairs AGAIN this morning. I was tiptoeing out of our bedroom so as not to wake Austen (who'd come down at six and then fallen asleep again), with my sneakers and socks in one hand and some cash and my Starbucks card in the other. I'd noticed on several occasions recently that when my feet are dry, the wood floors&#8212;and especially the wood stairs&#8212;become very slippery, so I should have been more careful here. Of...

 There's been a lot of walking going on here at Casa Hylan-Cho. It started a couple weeks ago, when I finally figured out how to work some exercise into my day: go to bed earlier. (Duh! Although, as you've probably noticed, going to bed earlier means less blogging.) I now get up when Al and Austen do, put on my exercise clothes, and go out for a walk/jog/hop/whatever. Usually I end my route at a Starbucks, where I purchase...

 I should preface this post by saying that I am more or less following a plan to get control of my mood swings, irritability, occasional bouts of depression, and generally erratic behavior, and that this plan involves eating a potato every night at bedtime. The potato is designed to boost my serotonin levels a bit&#8212;emphasis on a bit. Too much potato = too much serotonin = headaches and wild dreams. So this could all just be the potato talking....

 We arrived safely home&#8212;but sick&#8212;from San Francisco on Sunday night. Austen caught a cold on his second day in SF, and he passed it on to me on Friday night. For some reason the version I got was more virlulent, and... well, you probably don't want to know the color or quantity of the goo I'm now hacking up with every coughing fit. Never have I been more glad that I work at home, where I can drag my...

 I keep remembering new behaviors that Austen exhibited for the first time during his 15th month of life which I neglected to mention in my 15 month update (or anywhere else&#8212;I haven't been writing in my little bedside journal regularly lately, either). I figure I'd better record them somewhere before I forget, and here seems as good a place as any. The main three that have come to mind in the past 24 hours:...

 OK, so here's where I admit that I occasionally do wish that I were one of the Cool Kids. Most of the time I'm like, "yeah, I know the cool kids, but I don't hang out with them. Because, you know, I've got my own stuff to do," but lately several of my favorite blogs have all been doing the Four Things Meme, and I confess I was feeling a little left out.

 Avid fans of Sesame Street will recognize the title of this post as the line that the Count sings to the Countess after the number 14, which makes it appropriate for a summary of Austen's 14th month of being. (It's also, incidentally, the title of a Cole Porter song.)...

 From about 9pm to 1am last night, I was plagued with what I can only assume was food poisoning. I'm guessing&#8212;but cannot prove&#8212;that the culprit was a Brazilian Shrimp Burrito from Whole Foods; I got a bad one once before and almost swore off them completely back then. I *will* be swearing off them completely from now on. I was worried that I might never be able to eat another orange as well after last night's drama&#8212;an orange being...

 As promised, here are the before and after photos from Austen and Lori's Haircut Adventure. The cut I got is very similar to the one I got in May, only with shorter bangs and the part on the opposite side. (I kinda wish she'd left the bangs a bit longer, but I think she did it this way to even them up&#8212;they were shorter on the right than the left.) Austen got his cut while sitting on my lap...

 We are all sick here at Casa Hylan-Cho. Austen has been sick almost continuously since he caught the cold I had at Christmas, and I have been sick off and on with various chest and sinus afflictions since before that. At the moment, Al's the sickest of us all; he's been home from work for a couple days now. I've been washing my hands like a maniac, but as I've said to Al, that doesn't help so much when...
