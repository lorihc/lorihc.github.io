<h3 class="title">Uniquely Qualified to Judge</h3>

<p>
I've decided to start reviewing bathrooms around Philadelphia (and probably further afield, if we travel in the next three months), mainly because I've been seeing so many of them lately, and I've noticed that I review them mentally anyway. Since I'm starting a new category for these reviews, and it's conceivable that a new reader could happen upon it without having read any of my other posts, let me explain what makes me uniquely qualified to judge public restrooms in the city I live in: I'm pregnant. I'm nearing the end of the second trimester, and at this point I'm lucky to be able to make it 10 blocks between bathroom visits. I certainly have to go before leaving the house, and again upon reaching my destination (if not en route as well). I imagine that by the ninth month, I'll be down to three blocks at most; my husband and I are already planning our nightly walking routes accordingly. Even before I got pregnant, however, I knew about several of these spots&#8212;mainly because I often take long walks around the city.

Before I start reviewing, I want to say that I appreciate that these bathrooms are available to me at all; I've learned over the years how to find a bathroom in New York City when necessary, but it's still much easier to find one here in Philly. My bladder thanks you, providers of public (or semi-public) facilities in the City of Brotherly Love. (Btw, for those who don't yet know how to find a bathroom in New York City, I've got one word for you: Hotels.)
</p>

<p>
I've got a backlog of bathrooms in my brain (and obviously, a penchant for alliteration, but that's another topic...), but I don't know how many I'll be able to stay awake to review tonight. Possibly only one. :)
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.doubletree.com/en/dt/hotels/dining_detail.jhtml?ctyhocn=PHLBLDT&index=0" target="a8_win">Standing O Bar</a></b><br />
<b>Location: </b>Corner of Broad &amp; Locust, inside the Doubletree Hotel<br />
<b>Shortest route to restroom: </b>Enter on Locust, walk straight back past the bar; bathrooms are in the hallway.<br />
<b>Ease of access: </b>Good. I've noticed the staff watching me walk back to the bathroom single-mindedly, but no one's ever said a word.<br />
<b>Quality of facilities: </b>Average. The women's room has only two stalls (now that I'm pregnant, I have to use the wheelchair-accessible one because I can barely clear the belly when I shut the door in the other one) in a fairly cramped space, and the cigarette smoke tends to drift in from the bar (either under the door or through the ventilation system, I'm not sure which). However, there's usually soap in at least one dispenser, seat covers in the stalls, actual paper towels (I'm not a fan of dryers), and, most amazingly, <em>two-ply toilet paper</em>. Fairly soft two-ply toilet paper, especially for a commercial establishment.

<b><a href="http://www.starwood.com/sheraton/search/hotel_detail.html?requestedChainCode=SI&requestedAffiliationCode=SI&propertyID=215" target="a8_win">Sheraton Rittenhouse Square</a></b><br />
<b>Location: </b>Corner of 18th &amp; Locust, on the east side of the Square<br />
<b>Shortest route to restroom: </b>Enter on Locust, via the door next to Potcheen (one of the hotel's two restaurants). NB: This door is often locked in the evenings; in this case, enter through the main hotel entrance at the corner of 18th and Locust, pass the reservations desk, and walk straight back until you see a hallway (up two or three steps) to your right. The bathrooms are in this hallway.<br />
<b>Ease of access: </b>Good. I had to ask the location of the restrooms on my first visit, and I was directed pleasantly. Access is very good indeed if you can enter on Locust.<br />
<b>Quality of facilities: </b>Excellent. The women's room is large (at least 6 stalls, maybe more&#8212;I'll update this post later with the actual count), with a lovely sink area and comfy chairs if you need a rest or a place to apply a bandage to a blister; the stalls are standard size and have hooks for bags. As for paper products, there are seat covers, facial tissues (aka Kleenex), and a good supply of paper towels. The toilet paper is standard large roll commercial grade.

<b><a href="http://marriott.com/property/propertyPage.mi?marshaCode=PHLDT" target="a8_win">Philadelphia Marriott Downtown</a></b><br />
<b>Location: </b>1201 Market Street<br />
<b>Shortest route to restroom: </b>From Market Street, enter through revolving door and walk counter-clockwise (i.e., to the right) around the rotunda. Pass the restaurant and lobby cafe, and look for a hallway on your right past the potted palm (it's adjacent to a seating area and across from the reservations desk). From Filbert Street, the hallway is on the left (enter at either end of the seating area across from the reservations desk).<br />
<b>Ease of access: </b>Excellent. This is a busy downtown hotel with lots of natural foot traffic. Despite the posted signs that "restrooms are for hotel patrons only," no one will notice or mind if you use the facilities.<br />
<b>Quality of facilities: </b>Good. I think there are four stalls in the women's room, all of average size. They're not in great shape (some are missing hooks, and the in-stall receptacle shared by two of them has been mangled, but the location and accessibility of this restroom can't be beat (it wins hands down over the lines at the entirely-too-small women's room in the adjacent Reading Terminal Market), so I'm not complaining. The toilet paper is standard small roll commercial grade (each stall has several rolls available), seat covers are provided, and the sink area has a nice granite countertop, soap in at least one dispenser, and thick paper towels as well as a dryer. There's also a full-length mirror in which to make sure your skirt is straight or your belly isn't hanging out as you exit.
