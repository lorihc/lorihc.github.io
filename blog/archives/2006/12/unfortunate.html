<h3 class="title">Unfortunate</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.fussy.org/2006/12/three-things-that-you-may-or-may-not.html">Eden</a> was just talking about the burden of being named Eden, and how her husband trumped her by being named Jack Kennedy. From <a href="http://www.fussy.org/">Fussy</a> I cruised over to the NY Times website, where I happened to find this quote in an article about how <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/health/14hiv.html?ex=157680000&en=0586902d1bc91dc1&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">circumcision can cut the risk of getting HIV from heterosexual intercourse in half</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
Circumcision is “not a magic bullet, but a potentially important intervention,” said Dr. Kevin M. De Cock, director of H.I.V./AIDS for the World Health Organization.
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh yes. I think we have a winner.

<p>You have to love it when people end up in careers perfectly suited for their names.</p>

<p>Like the pastry chef at The Continental Midtown, Kate Honeyman.  Or the former head of my OB practice, Dr. Mama.</p>

<p>Oh, I have one...my former OB/GYN doctor at Kaiser was James K. Massengill.  I never made any comments to him about his name, but some time after I had been seeing him, his nurse told me that *was* his family - the douche company. :D  BTW, he was an awesome doctor, who I was very sorry to give up when I changed medical plans. </p>

<p>A pediatrician on call was "Dr. Supersad" and I had a really difficult time not saying "this is super sad" while describing how my son had been vomiting et al for days.</p>

<p>But, your find is absolutely the best. :)</p>
