<h3 class="title">Ugh, Green Onions</h3>

<p>
I've been planning on writing about the three simple but perfect nights we had this week, but I haven't had a chance yet. It was on my agenda for last night, but I found I was so tired that I just... couldn't... blog.
</p>
<p>
The three perfect nights started on Tuesday, when we went to the Cherry Hill Mall to buy The Beaner a winter coat and some new pants (I guess we should have expected him to grow out of size 2T quickly, since there's not much difference between 18-24 months and 2T, but somehow we didn't). There's some sale-related goodness around the clothing story that I'll explain in more detail when I actually write the Three Perfect Nights post, but the thing I wanted to mention right now is that I had some delicious Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes at the Taco Bell in the food court that night. The best thing about those potatoes&#8212;the garnish that <em>made</em> the dish, IMHO&#8212;were the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=avO4eppJJF8Q&refer=news">green onions</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, the beaner refused to eat any potatoes, though he did have a few bites of my beans-only Crunchwrap Supreme.

<p>We pretty much skipped right over 2T and went to 3T early.  Some things were a little big for a bit, but I didn't want to buy something he'd grow out of in an instant.</p>

<p>That onions thing freaks me out!</p>

<p>I have never understood the difference between 24 mo and 2T clothes. That, plus size seems to vary so much between brands. </p>

<p>Glad you dodged the E.Coli bullet!</p>
