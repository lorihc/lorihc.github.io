<h3 class="title">Obviously Taking a Break After NaBloPoMo</h3>

<p>
I didn't actually <em>plan</em> to take a blogging break after NaBloPoMo (I won prize for sticking with it, btw&#8212;yay!), but I'm actually on a roll with work at the moment, and I haven't wanted to take time out between snuggle breaks with The Beaner to convert all the notes I have on my desk into blog posts. Sorry about that.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of work, I found out last night that one of the most senior engineers on the team&#8212;and the only one in my time zone&#8212;is leaving. I'm sad for the team because he's going to be wicked tough to replace, and I'm sad for myself because it's going to mean three hours every morning when I won't have anyone to ping when I have a question. The odds of finding another engineer like him are low enough, but the odds of finding someone who'll be in my time zone are virtually nonexistant. It's hard to work remotely when you don't know the team or the product well, even if you're a superstar. Heck, it's hard to work remotely when you *do* know the team and the product well.
</p>

<p>
Oh well, at least my manager&#8212;who's also knowledgeable, patient, and willing to help whenever he's not in a meeting&#8212;gets up early most days.
