<h3 class="title">Missing Mommy</h3>

<p>
I've got so many half-written posts queued up that by the time I publish them all, they won't even appear on the front page anymore. I didn't want serious writer's block on all things BlogHer to impede my posting on the heat (which is now up to 93&deg;, with a heat index of 103&deg; <em>at 11:55am</em>) and on Austen's latest clinginess, however, so I'm jumping in here with a kid update.
</p>

<p>
When I went away to Vancouver in May, it really seemed like Austen hadn't missed me much. He was happy to see me when I got back, of course, but in a subdued way. I figured this weekend away would be much the same, but as with all things parenting-related, it's when you think you've got things dialed in that they take a radical turn. 
</p>

<p>
Austen was happy enough to be with his dad while I was gone, but Hannah reported that he was crankier and whinier during the day on Thursday and Friday. And remember how he woke up screaming at 3am the morning I was to leave for San Francisco? Well, he did that every night I was gone, too. I told Al when I got back that I'd like to nip the nighttime screaming to be picked up in the bud, so that Austen didn't get used to coming to sleep with us before 6am, but last night the screaming started at 2am again. We let him go for 45 minutes, after which he switched to shouting "mom! momma! moooooooooooom!" at the top of his lungs. I finally caved and went up there, but I didn't bring him down. Instead, I picked him up and sat with him in the chair for a while. He immediately burrowed his head in my shoulder and clung to me as if he might fall off of a cliff otherwise.
</p>

<p>
After much soothing, clinging, forehead kissing, and murmurings of "I love you, it's time for sleeping, Mommy's very tired, please get ahold of yourself, I love you, I'm not leaving you, I'm just going to bed, I love you, please go to sleep, I'll be here in the morning, calm down now, I love you," etc., I left him crying again and went back to bed. I think the soothing session helped, though, because he only carried on for about another 15 minutes (and he slept until 7:40!).
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Austen's been super-clingy during the day as well&#8212;and he completely FREAKS OUT if I try to leave the room, let alone the house. Yesterday he saw me head to the door with my purse and sunglasses (I had a dentist appointment in the morning), and he ran at me yelling "noooooooooo," tripped, fell, and lay there sobbing. It was the most pitiful thing I'd ever seen. He really seems worried that if he loses sight of me, I may never come back. I fear that we are entering that phase of Austen's life where his pain breaks my heart a little every day, and yet all the whining still drives me completely up a wall.
</p>

<p>
For the record, the need to cling isn't all on Austen's side; yesterday I had an almost overwhelming urge to go downstairs and just hug him for all he was worth for a little while. I may do that between meetings (me) and nap (him) today. Who knows? Maybe a little extra clinging during the day will help us both sleep through the night.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Short Attention Span</h3>

<p>
First, let me say: You know it's going to be a scorcher when you're forced to seek the shady side of the street at <em>7:30am</em>. Phew! Second: This isn't a humorous post, and it'll probably be totally boring to everybody but me, but I wanted to write about this subject, SO I AM. Feel free to move along.
</p>

<p>
So I got to thinking on my walk this morning about attention span. Mine, when I am working, vacillates between horrifically short and "oops, I forgot to eat lunch". The former happens if I am forced to wait more than 3 seconds* for anything&#8212;a file to download, a page to load in a browser, an application to open, an executable to build&#8212;and can quickly spiral out of control. For example, if I attempt to visit a site and it takes more than a few seconds to load, I'll switch to Outlook to check my e-mail. There I'll see a message about some bug or other, and I'll switch to the debugger to check it out. Once in the debugger I'll realize that I need to sync to the head and rebuild before I can reproduce the bug, so I'll switch to Perforce and sync. This will take more than 3 seconds, so I'll switch back to Outlook and read the rest of my mail.
</p>

<p>
If I'm lucky, I'll finish reading my mail and remember that I was syncing to the head, go back to the debugger, and start a build. (Sometimes I'm not lucky, though, and I'll switch to one of my other laptops to look at my personal e-mail or a blog or to see where I left off fixing a Mac bug, or I'll get sidetracked by another e-mail.) If I press F5 (for Start Debugging) and the "these projects are out of date, would you like to build them?" dialog takes too long to come up&#8212;or worse, it goes behind another app when I turn my head to take a sip of coffee&#8212;I'll end up reading more e-mail, realizing that the site I originally tried to load has finally loaded, or go back to reading blogs before I notice that the build never started. When I finally do notice that the build never started and press OK in the sneaky dialog, I'll be all exasperated over the wasted time and then proceed... to waste more time (or, as I think of it, "do other productive things instead of wasting time waiting for a build").
</p>

<p>
Now, all of the things I've been doing while waiting for that page to load in the browser or for the build to finish needed doing (well, maybe except for reading the blogs), but because I didn't stay focused on any one thing for very long, I've left a lot of loose ends hanging. Once in a while I tie them all up by the end of the day, but not always; sometimes it takes two or three days before I reach the end of all the threads. 
</p>

<p>
At the opposite end of the scale are days when I practically have my nose pressed to the screen, and I get so absorbed in coding that I don't notice that I haven't read e-mail all day or even gotten up to pee. These days are rarer at the moment because I happen to be working on features and bugs that require me to switch between Dreamweaver, one or more browsers, and MSDev constantly... and as we just learned, app switching is the quickest way to send me off on a mental tangent. I think my ability to stay focused is indirectly proportional to the number of laptops on my desk and the number of applications/windows that each machine has open, and if that's the case, at the moment I'm doomed. I've got 17 items in my Windows taskbar on this machine alone (5 Windows Explorer windows, MSDev, Jabber, P4, 3 Araxis merge windows, Outlook, Firefox [with 8 tabs open], Timbuktu, a remote access window to a machine in San Francisco that's running IE5.5, Dreamweaver, and a Trillian IM window); a similar situation exists on the MacBook Pro and on my personal laptop (which I occasionally use to reproduce bugs in older versions of some software). Add to the mess the fact that the more applications I have open, the slower everything runs, which means longer waits, which means more app-switching. Arg!
</p>

<p>
I remember back in 2002 or 2003 someone on the team sent around a link to an article about having blocks of "concentration time." If I remember correctly, it said that in order to get any real work done, engineers needed blocks of at least X hours (was it 2? 3? 4? I think 3) of uninterrupted coding time. Occasionally I get that, and when I do, I'm SUPER productive. For example, I fixed a bunch of bugs (6? 7?) on the plane to San Francisco last week under totally adverse conditions (cramped space, no external mouse, slow build times due to running on battery). What I would also normally consider an adverse condition&#8212;lack of phone or Internet access&#8212;probably worked in my favor, as it kept me from being distracted by meetings, e-mail, or blogs. I can't just unplug my network cable on a regular basis, however, as I usually need access to the bugbase, documents on the server, Perforce, etc. to get my work done. Fixing 6 or 7 bugs just based on the bug subject lines (as I did on the plane) isn't doable on a regular basis.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that my insanely productive times balance out my super-distracted ones, and I end up getting all my work done just fine. However, I'd really like to get my app-switching obsession under control. I think it's time to recognize that I'm better off waiting 5-10 seconds for a page to load or a file to download than trying to make good use of the lull by doing something else. I figure I could increase my productivity at least 50% this way, and then I'd have *more* time for reading blogs and books and spending time with my family and watching TV. I'm still trying to sort out how to do this, however. Turning e-mail off entirely usually helps (though turning off the little "you have mail" indicator in the system tray does not&#8212;I just end up switching to Outlook more often to see if I have any new mail), as does turning off Jabber and Trillian. The problem is that I telecommute, and if I weren't available on e-mail and IM, that would be Bad. Still, I might consider doing it for a couple hours a day, after all my meetings are done for the day (if Outlook isn't on, I won't get meeting reminders).
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it's probably worth thinking about further. If anything brilliant occurs to me, I'll be sure to post it here, where no one will want to read it. :)
</p>

<p>
*Can you imagine what life was like when all Internet operations happened at modem speed? I honestly can't remember how I managed my restlessness back then, though it was probably by getting up for food or coffee.

<h3 class="title">BlogHer Roundup</h3>

<p>
 I'd really like to be honest about my BlogHer experience, but I think it's also probably wise to be a bit circumspect. I apologize in  advance if I hurt anyone's feelings with my honesty or bore anyone to death with my circumspection.
</p>

<p>
When I first heard about BlogHer in 2005, I was conflicted. On the one hand, I wanted to support women and blogging. On the other hand, it just seemed like it would be a gathering of the popular bloggers we all know and love, and I worried it would just be a love fest among the elite&#8212;without any larger implications for women or blogging.  I waffled in my conflictedness long enough that registration  filled up, and the decision whether to go  was taken out of my hands. I think Austen (who, at 7 months, was still nursing) and Al (who's in the &quot;why would you do that?&quot; camp when it comes to blogging) were secretly relieved.
</p>
<p>
This year I waffled again, though more because the conference had expanded so much rather than because I feared it would be too limited in scope. I knew I wanted to participate this time, but I was a little afraid of ALL THOSE WOMEN, [a] because I'm a bit of an introvert, and [b] because I'm generally not a fan of girls-only anything. In any case, I finally pulled the trigger and registered, and for the most part, I'm glad I did. If I hadn't gone to BlogHer, I probably wouldn't have met <a href="http://www.fussy.org/">Mrs. Kennedy</a>, with whom I'd started to feel I had something in common over the past year. (One thing I didn't realize we had in common until I met her in person: I'm tall, and she's taller.) We happened to meet when I was feeling a little worn out by all the frenzied socializing on the morning of Day One, and the fact that we were able to share a companionable silence at the Podcasting session&#8212;the fact that though we weren't talking to each other it felt like we were there <em>together</em> and not just there at the same time&#8212;made me like her more than anything else she could have said or done.  (We did end up chatting toward the end of the session, and that was lovely, too.)
</p>
<p>
<span style="float:right; margin-left:10px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/jeanne/" title="Photo Sharing" class="special"><img src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/blogher/jeanne.jpg" alt="Jeanne, eating a Red Vine" width="309" height="326" border="0" /></a></span>If I hadn't gone to BlogHer, I definitely wouldn't have met <a href="http://princessbookworm.blogspot.com/">Jeanne</a>, who made me laugh so often and so heartily (and yet without inducing an asthma attack! how did she do that??) that I think she singlehandedly propelled me through <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/07/yeah_so_day_2.html">Day Two</a>.  In addition to being amazingly fun to be around, Jeanne is a voracious reader and prolific writer of amazingly articulate book and movie reviews, so from now on I'm sure never to be without a good book to read. I only wish she lived closer to me (sadly, she's in Seattle), because I would so hang out with her every day if she were nearby.
</p>
<p>
 If I hadn't gone to BlogHer, I also probably would never have crossed paths with <a href="http://www.brainreserves.blogspot.com/">Sheryle</a>. I met Sheryle at the cocktail party on Day Two (in other words, a mere hour or so before the end of the conference), when she joined <a href="http://byjane.livejournal.com/">Jane</a> (who's a firecracker in her own right), Jeanne, and me in conversation. It turned out that Jeanne and Sheryle had sat next to one another at an earlier panel (or perhaps at lunch on Day One?), which is how she happened to pick us out at the cocktail party. (So in addition to being great for all the reasons I listed above, Jeanne is also a MAGNET for interesting people.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, after listening to Sheryle for a sentence or two and being unable to decide whether her accent was more Georgia or more North Carolina, I split the difference and asked if she was from South Carolina (I figured maybe she was from the Augusta, GA area, which is on the border). She said no, Georgia, but she'd also lived in Virginia, which is probably why I'd had difficulty identifying the accent.  At that point Jeanne, Jane, and I got into a frenzied dissection of the origins of various Southern accents (&quot;it was the Irish in Appalachia!&quot; &quot;no, it was the British who colonized Georgia and New England, which is why the Southern and Boston accents are actually pretty similar!&quot;). Sheryle, thank god, only let us go on for about a minute before finding an opening in which to announce, &quot;I should probably confess that I have a Master's in linguistics and dialectology&quot; BEFORE YOU MAKE JACKASSES OF YOURSELVES, she could have added, but didn't.
</p>
<p>
 It occurred to me to mention, since Sheryle was from Georgia, that I had attended the University of Georgia. &quot;In Athens?&quot; asked Sheryle. &quot;Me too!&quot; I replied that I suspected a few years separated our tenures there, at which point Jane's jaw dropped, and she gave me a look like, &quot;I can't believe you just insulted her that way.&quot; I read the look correctly and said, &quot;hey, I'm not saying she's OLD. I'm saying that she's probably more than 4 years older than I am, is all.&quot; We went on to discover that we'd both been English majors (&quot;Park Hall!&quot;) and tried to come up with any professors that we might have had in common. Finally, because I wasn't sure whether Jane had forgiven me the smart-ass &quot;young&quot; person remark, I said, &quot;so what year did you graduate?&quot;
</p>
<p>
Sheryle laughed and said, &quot;oh, probably before you were born!&quot; I said no, come on, hit me. &quot;1968,&quot; she said. Me: &quot;OK, that was the year I was born. See?&quot; I said to Jane, &quot;I wasn't being mean when I suggested that there were a few years between us... though when I said it, I didn't imagine that there were as many as 22!&quot; We all laughed and talked some more about Sheryle's career (she's currently CEO of a company called <a href="http://www.quixit.com/">Quixit</a>), meeting Vince Dooley and other minor celebrities (like, say, Kofi Annan), keeping our brains fit, and where Sheryle gets her hair cut (Ode, in San Francisco). 
</p>

</p>
<p>
If I hadn't gone to BlogHer, I wouldn't have had so much  time to hang out with <a href="http://www.hchamp.com/">Heather</a>, whom I've known for 10 years but whom I rarely get to see. We both lived in the NYC area when we met&#8212;at a web conference in Chicago in Feburary 1996&#8212;but I moved to San Francisco 6 months later. We taught a couple clases and sat on a couple panels together at various Internet Worlds, but we didn't see each other regularly until Heather moved out to San Francisco herself a couple years later. Then, of course, I met Al, I moved to the boondocks of Mountain View, and then together Al and I moved to Philadelphia, which meant Heather and I were on opposite coasts again. It was so great to catch up and just relax around someone I already knew and felt comfortable around.
</p>
<p>
I must confess that I went to Heather's session on becoming a better photographer mainly to support Heather, but without seriously expecting to learn anything new (which is not to say that I don't have far, far to go in my photography efforts; I just thought that she couldn't possibly cover anything in depth in an hour). I was surprised and delighted to find that she was able to touch on many <a href="http://www.rentglass.com/">useful</a> points, not least of which was how to use the Unsharp Mask filter in Photoshop (or Fireworks, which is what I've been using until recently). Who knew that I'd been doing it wrong all these years? Who knew that it was called Unsharp MASK for a reason? I have two words for anyone who, like me, has been unhappy with the results of Sharpen in Photoshop or Fireworks or even with adjusting the Sharpness slider in iPhoto: SELECTIVE SHARPENING. (Apparently this was a revelation for <a href="http://www.mommybrain.net/">Amy</a>, too, as we looked at each other afterwards and said simultaneously, &quot;OMG, Unsharp MASK? I always sharpened the WHOLE THING!&quot;
</p>
<p>
OK, now that I've gotten the top 4 reasons I'm glad I went to BlogHer out of the way, a quick summary of other things I liked and didn't like about BlogHer:
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Good</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.agirlandaboy.com/journal/">Meeting</a> <a href="http://www.superherodesigns.com/journal/">new</a> <a href="http://www.leahpeah.com/blog/index.php">people</a>.
<br />
The <a href="http://www.lizardkingdom.org/archives/2006/07/everyone_should.html">Accessibility</a> portion of the <a href="http://blogher.org/node/7262">Primp Your Blog</a>  session. BEST PRESENTATION EVER.<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/205706872/">My new Eggbeater t-shirt</a> (buying it from <a href="http://eggbeater.typepad.com/">Shuna</a>  was pretty cool, too). 
<br />
It <a href="http://laidoffdad.typepad.com/lod/">wasn't</a> <a href="http://www.allaboutgeorge.com/">all</a> women.<br />
The &quot;All You Need is Love&quot; spontaneous sing-a-long when the sound on the &quot;how has your blog changed your world?&quot; Flash movie failed at the Day Two welcoming session.
<br />
Arianna Huffington at the closing keynote. I'd seen her in political debates before, but I wasn't sure she'd have anything relevant to say to a bunch of bloggers. Turned out she did.<br />
The <a href="http://blogher.org/node/5110">Is the Next Martha Stewart a Blogger?</a> session. This was another session I attended more to support the speakers than because I thought I'd be interested, but it was incredibly interesting and informative. Maybe that should be my strategy next year: Go to the sessions I don't expect to be interested in.<br />
Videochatting with Austen every night (and once during the <a href="http://blogher.org/node/5990">Art Bloggers</a> session; Mrs. Kennedy gave me a &quot;what the hell are you waving at?&quot; look when I got a little enthusiastic in front of the iSight).<br />
The weather. Oh, how I miss Northern California, with its cool, overcast mornings and its warm, dry afternoons.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Bad</strong><br />
Meeting new people. OK, this wasn't bad, <em>per se</em>&#8212;just so, so overwhelming. <br />
The food: Not enough protein at breakfast or lunch, not enough vegetables at dinner. 
Also, can we get some sponsors willing to provide real, full-fat, full-taste snacks next year? May I suggest Luna bars? <br />
The <a href="http://www.contrex.com/">water</a>: Now with extra minerals! Yuck!
I don't think I've ever been so dehydrated. <br />
The wireless acess. Totally sucked, but not exactly for the reason given; it was more about misconfiguring the servers than about expecting 800 businessment to check e-mail occasionally. The 800 businessmen  made for a better story, though.
<br />
The snubbing. Luckily this only happened to me once, but it was still a scowl-inducer: She-who-will-not-be-named: &quot;Hey, good to see you here!&quot; Me: &quot;Oh, hi!&quot; SWWNBN (to friend): &quot;I know her because of X.&quot; Me: &quot;Yeah, X, that was fun. I really appreciate...&quot; (at this point I kinda trailed off, because SWWNBN turned her back to me in a gesture that unmistakeably meant &quot;I'm done with you now, move along.&quot;)
<br />
The hot, hot session rooms. The mind, it tends to melt down as the temperature goes up. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Ugly</strong><br />
The Hyatt San Jose. Dudes, can you say 'maintenance'? My room was apparently in better shape than most,  was only shabby and ill-designed rather than in downright disrepair, and luckily, it didn't reek of anything unusual, but I'm with <a href="http://www.cussandotherrants.com/">Suzanne</a>'s husband in that it was below my usual standards.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Missed Opportunities</strong><br />
I didn't get to meet <a href="http://www.alittlepregnant.com/">Julie</a>.<br />
Although I met <a href="http://www.finslippy.com/">Alice</a>, I think I kind of turned her off with my assertion that &quot;80 to 90 percent of the people here are probably introverts.&quot; Alice, as an extrovert (surprise!, at least to me), obviously disagreed, and we never really got to explore our differing views further.<br />
There were probably a bazillion other women (and men!) whom I would have really loved to meet / with whom I probably had LOTS in common, but I just couldn't put myself out there any farther. (Or is this another case for further?) 
</p>
<p>
I'm sure I'm forgetting a few things, as I've obviously been a lot more positive about the whole experience than I thought I'd be when I started writing this, but before I wrap up the roundup, allow me to point you to <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html">this interesting post from 2003 on Power Laws, Weblogs, and Inequality</a> (thanks to Al for IMing it to me, and to <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/">Karl Martino</a> for showing it to Al). It directly addresses all the griping about &quot;A-listers&quot; vs. &quot;B-listers&quot; (and &quot;first-generation mommybloggers&quot; vs. &quot;second-generation mommybloggers&quot;) that I heard this weekend, and makes me wonder <a href="http://blogher.org/node/8639">where we'll all be next year</a>, when the size of BlogHer (and the blogging community in general) doubles again.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Edited to add: </strong>Following are two pull-quotes from the article to whet your appetite. It's not long, and it's definitely worth reading.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A persistent theme among people writing about the social aspects of weblogging is to note (and usually  lament) the rise of an A-list, a small set of webloggers who account for a majority of the traffic in the weblog world. This complaint follows a common pattern we've seen with MUDs, BBSes, and online communities like Echo and the WELL. A new social system starts, and seems delightfully free of the elitism and cliquishness of the existing systems. Then, as the new system grows, problems of scale set in. Not everyone can participate in every conversation. Not everyone gets to be heard. Some core group seems more connected than the rest of us, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Prior to recent theoretical work on social networks, the usual explanations invoked individual behaviors: some members of the community had sold out, the spirit of the early days was being diluted by the newcomers, et cetera. We now know that these explanations are wrong, or at least beside the point. What matters is this: Diversity plus freedom of choice creates inequality, and the greater the diversity, the more extreme the inequality. 
</p>

<p>

Inequality occurs in large and unconstrained social systems for the same reasons stop-and-go traffic occurs on busy roads, not because it is anyone's goal, but because it is a reliable property that emerges from the normal functioning of the system. The relatively egalitarian distribution of readers in the early years had nothing to do with the nature of weblogs or webloggers. There just weren't enough blogs to have really unequal distributions. Now there are.

<h3 class="title">Yes, Captain</h3>

<p>
As a kid, I was NOT a fan of Star Trek. I WAS a fan of Star Wars, and it used to bug me royally when people would confuse the two or mistake me for a Trekkie. After I married Al, however, Star Trek started to grow on me a little. It's still probably not a show I'd ever watch on my own, but I enjoy watching it with Al, who explains all the relationships between the characters and the significance of the plots, the gadgets, and the locations to me as we're watching. I like that <em>he</em> likes it, and that I can understand each episode without having to watch every other episode. His enthusiasm for it is contagious, at least for the duration of an episode.
</p>

<p>
So all that's by way of saying, if I'd come across this quiz on <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/ratphooey/">ratphooey's blog</a> before I met Al, I would have just moved on to the next blog in my RSS reader. But because I read it today, after almost 4 years of marriage to Al and a good number of Star Trek episodes from each generation, I clicked the link to take the quiz. Here are the results:

Interestingly, the first time I took it, it came up as a tie between completely expendable redshirt guy and Jean Luc Picard, but for some reason redshirt trumped Picard, and I only got to see the description of Mr. Expendable. After reading the description, however, I figured out which factor to adjust*, and I knocked it down a notch to get the Picard description, which actually sounds a bit more like me. :)
</p>

<p style="font-size:smaller">
*I'd put ABSOLUTELY YES for "Do you often go unnoticed?", which was probably a stretch. My reason for doing so was that people often bump into me&#8212;physically bump into me&#8212;and then seem startled, like they hadn't seen me walking down the street toward them until they ran right into me. However, I think it's not an ABSOLUTELY YES situation, since there are probably ten times as many people who *do* notice me as who slam into me as if I were invisible. Thus I think the Picard designation is probably the right one, and Expendable Guy probably shouldn't even be ranked as high as he is.

<h3 class="title">Networking</h3>

<p>
I still haven't made my way to the sites of all the women I met at BlogHer, partly because my blog-reading time is limited by work and family obligations, and partly because as I read each woman's site, I end up getting sidetracked by her archives and photos and links to other sites. I'm finding myself down fascinating side roads this way.
</p>

<p>
Today I finally made it to <a href="http://electrolicious.com/">Ariel's site</a> and discovered that [a] she's probably the reason <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/201046027/">one of my Flickr photos</a> has over 600 views, about 6 times more than the rest of my "popular" photos, and [b] she came up with a great way to share details from all the interesting conversations she had at BlogHer without violating any confidences. Check out <a href="http://www.electrolicious.com/archives/2006/07/blogher_the_game_1.html">BlogHer, The game!</a>.

<h3 class="title">Five Things</h3>

<p>
Just made my weekly visit to <a href="http://foggyknit.blogspot.com/2006/08/five-things_04.html">foggyknit's site</a> and realized I'd been tagged for this:

<h3 class="title">Terminology</h3>

<p>
Last Friday morning I stopped, as I sometimes do while out on my morning walk, at the Metropolitan Bakery. I noticed a small quiche in the 1/2 price basket, inspected it carefully to try to determine its exact ingredients, and finally decided I'd have to ask. <em>Hmmm,</em> I thought to myself, <em>what if they consider this a tart and not a quiche? Wouldn't want to offend anyone by using such a common term as </em>quiche.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>Excuse me, can you tell me what kind of tart this is?<br />
<strong>Nasty Young Gentleman Behind Counter: </strong>What kind of <em>quiche</em> is it? I think it's shittake mushroom, possibly with artichokes.

<h3 class="title">Brand Recognition</h3>

<p>
Yes, I know I never did a 20 month update for the Beaner, and I'll probably regret it later when I have no record of the fact that the 20th month was the one in which he learned to say "please" out loud (or rather, "peeeeeezh!"), and that it was the month in which I suddenly realized why they always say the alphabet sooooo slooooowly on Sesame Street: It's so little kids can repeat the letters out loud (something the Beaner surprised us by doing one morning at around 6:45). Well, OK, now I have a record. Moving on...
</p>

<p>
I mentioned a while back that the Beaner had learned to identify Saabs. Last Monday when we pulled into a parking spot at the Cherry Hill Mall, he pointed at the car parked in front of us and said, "Ba!" I said, "No, honey, that's a Volvo. Also made in Sweden, incidentally, but not a Saab." "Ba!" he repeated. "No, Volvo. Vol-vo. Red Volvo," I said. We dashed into the mall, purchased a couple items at the Old Navy, and returned to the car. When I plopped the Beaner into his carseat, he pointed forward and said, "Volvo?" "Yes!" I said proudly, "that is a red Volvo." The Beaner repeated "Volvo, Volvo" to himself all the way home.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, the Beaner indicated that he would like to be taken out to our front stoop to look around. "Jeep!" he shouted, pointing to a green Cherokee parked on the corner. "Two Jeeps!" he squealed, moving his finger slightly to the left to aim at the gray Cherokee in the adjacent carport. He scanned down the street and then shouted, "VOLVO!" I was like, "where? Where do you see a Volvo?"... and then I craned my neck around our neighbor's flowers and saw that there was indeed a white Volvo XC90 (the same model as at the mall) parked midway down the block. I leaned into the house and shouted for Al. "You've got to see this!", I said. When Al came down, I said to the Beaner, "what do you see?" The Beaner fingered the white Volvo and shouted, "VOLVO!" Al was duly impressed.
</p>

<p>
A couple days later, the Beaner put his new letter-recognition skills to work and pointed out the VW logo on a Jetta parked around the block. (W has since become his favorite letter; he points it out whenever he sees one, though it's often difficult to determine that a W is what he's shouting about, since his word for W sounds extremely similar to his words for diaper, bubble, buckle, and pretzel.) He was off and running from there, pointing out every car he recognized, and asking "adjuwah?" for the ones he didn't. We'd supply the name, he'd memorize the emblem (though it took us a little while to figure out that that's what he was doing, since my sister insisted that he could identify cars when no emblem was visible. She was wrong about that; emblems tend to be plastered all over the car, including on the hubcaps, and the Beaner knows to scan the entire vehicle for a logo he recognizes), and then he'd point out the new makes along with the old. He now recognizes an impressive list of auto makes, including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Saab (ba)</li>
<li>Volvo</li>
<li>Toyota (lolo)</li>
<li>Volkswagen (buhbu)</li>
<li>Honda (aitch)</li>
<li>Nissan (nitt-an)</li>
<li>Saturn (dat-turn)</li>
<li>Jeep (jip)</li>
<li>Acura</li>
<li>Mazda</li>
<li>Chevy (wee-vee)</li>
<li>Ford (doh)</li>
<li>Mitsubishi (mitsu)</li>
<li>BMW (momo)</li>
<li>Mercedes (Y)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Before he learned the Chevrolet emblem he'd often confuse Chevy SUVs for Jeeps (though never the other way around), and although he can pick out almost any model of Volvo, the Lexus RX300 throws him for a loop (he always misidentifies it as a Volvo). He's still working on Infinity (he knows the logo, but he hasn't come up with a name for it yet, so he usually just points and stammers). It's pretty entertaining, and of course his father and my father (both car nuts) are super proud of their little savant. My sister-in-law, however, would be horrified, I think; she's expressed dismay in the past when Al has pointed out BMWs to her son, as she'd rather not have him be brand-conscious. 
</p>

<p>
For now the Beaner's talent doesn't bother me; it seems like a not-unhealthy way to observe the world around him. He doesn't seem to attach any kind of worth to the brands he's identifying, so I'm not worried that being able to identify so many auto makes is going to turn him into a label snob or anything. For what it's worth, he's as happy to identify letters as car emblems. I think this is something else that Sesame Street has taught him: That letters are everywhere. (My favorite alphabet segment is the one where they take letters from signs around Seattle.) The night before last, as he was running around pointing at every W he could find, Al remarked, "somebody's on an alphaquest!" Does it really matter if those Ws are on cars? I think not.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Daytripping</h3>

<p>
Earlier this week, when I heard from the Weather Channel that it was supposed to be cooler and drier this weekend&#8212;and cooler and drier still in New England&#8212;I proposed that we drive to Connecticut to enjoy the weather and restock my supply of Decaf Chocolate Truffle coffee. (I mix it 3:4 with Starbucks Decaf Verona for a rich iced coffee treat, in case you're curious.) My original idea was that we'd stay overnight and then drive back on Sunday morning, but as Al's Fantasy Football draft was scheduled for Sunday afternoon, he wanted to make it a day trip. The draft was later postponed, but our daytrip plans stayed the same. After all, it only took us two hours and 45 minutes to get from Norwalk, CT to Philadelphia when we drove back from Maine.
</p>

<p>
We planned to get up as usual on Saturday morning. I'd take my walk and have a shower, Al would feed the Beaner and get him dressed, we'd throw a cooler, some icepacks, the Beaner's DVD bag, and the camera in the car, and we'd probably leave around 9:30am. Everything went pretty much as planned, though I took the time to burn a couple CDs of tunes to try out on the Beaner, and I also checked the diaper bag to make sure we had at least two spares and some wipes. I noticed that the extra pair of shorts in the diaper bag was too small for the Beaner now, so I grabbed another pair and a shirt out of the dryer, thinking of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/201331585/">major diaper malfunction</a> that struck Al in Princeton a couple weeks ago. We pulled out of the garage at 10:06, and that's when the fun began.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

</p>
<p class="picStory">
<strong>11:45:09 ~ Grover Cleveland Service Area, NJ Turnpike</strong><br />
Al, the driver, is ready for some caffeine, so we stop between exits 11 and 12 on the Turnpike to get a Iced Grande Soy Chai, a Decaf Short Latte, and a Horizon Vanilla Milk. Whee, this is fun!
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<img src="/blog/images/daytrip/sat/12.49.50.jpg" alt="Al behind the wheel, stuck in traffic" width="500" height="333" class="special" />
</p>
<p class="picStory">
<strong>12:49:50 ~ Somewhere on I-95, after the Geo Wash Br/Lincoln Tunnel split, but  before the actual Geo Wash Br </strong><br />
Al catches me trying to take his picture and smiles. &quot;Why are you smiling?&quot; I ask. &quot;I'm trying to get a photo of you looking defeated, exhausted, and annoyed at being stuck in traffic!&quot; At this point the ridiculous backup we've been stuck in for about 30 minutes starts to seem funny. At the same time, it's so disheartening&#8212;so not what we had in mind&#8212;that we consider turning around. The only thing that's really stopping us is that traffic going the other way is just as bad.
</p>
<p class="pictureP">&nbsp; 
<img src="/blog/images/daytrip/sat/12.56.20.jpg" alt="40 min upper/60 min lower: George Washington Bridge" width="333" height="500" class="special"/>
</p>
<p class="picStory">
<strong>12:56:20 ~ Still not to the bridge yet</strong><br />
Is this a good sign or a bad sign? Should we be encouraged that it's only going to take us 40 minutes to get over the bridge, or discouraged that holy freaking cow, it's going to take us 40 minutes to go about 5 miles?! Incidentally, it was pretty smooth sailing for us once the EZPass lane opened up on the left... about 5 feet before the actual toll booth.
</p>
<p>
OK, at this point, for some reason, I stopped taking photos for several hours. Maybe it ceased to be funny when we finally made it off the Cross-Bronx Expressway and over the line into Connecticut... only to be stuck again in stop and go traffic. The Beaner fell asleep at about this time, confounding Al's plans to have him sleep on the way home, and making us worry that even if we got there soon, we'd still be stuck driving around in an attempt to get him at least an hourlong nap. (What we didn't know at this point as that it was going to take us another hour to reach our destination anyway.) My theories about stupid Yankee fans were blown to hell (the first pitch of the game happened while we were on the bridge), and instead I started cursing all the people who were just out DRIVING AROUND because it's summer. Yeah, people like us.
</p>
<p>
The most likely reason I stopped taking photos was because Al had announced that he thought we should just get a room and spend the night. This announcement took much of the pressure to GET THERE off us, and so I think it didn't occur to me to document the crawl any longer. Instead of thinking about photos, we turned our minds to other topics: Was there anything we needed that couldn't be bought at a drugstore or mall? (Yes, some medications, but I determined that I could go a few extra hours without them.) And, more importantly, how were we going to find a hotel? We had no AAA Tourbooks, no laptops, and no Blackberry with us. (Funny that it's only occurring to me now that we could have stopped somewhere and asked for a Yellow Pages. :) I knew that there were some hotels in Norwalk because [a] I'd stayed in one for about a week in 1995 when I took a job in Westport before finding a place to live, and [b] I'd considered overnighting there on our way back from Maine last month (we ended up staying near my  friend Sandy in Mass. instead). However, I couldn't remember where the hotels were or to which chains they belonged. 
</p>
<p>
Somewhere around Stamford I asked Al if he'd be at all interested in seeing where I used to live in South Norwalk. I also mentioned that if he was up for it, I'd like to see if Sunshine Pizza was still just over the bridge on Washington Street. He said sure, and I instructed my bladder to hold on <em>just a little longer</em>. Now this is where I should really have gotten out the camera, but in my defense, <strong>I had a full bladder, dammit</strong>, and it was making me stupid. I neglected to take ANY photos of Washington Street, which looks as it did when I lived there, only a bit more vibrant, and with almost none of the same businesses in residence; nor did I take any photos of the river, with its cool drawbridge and colorful boat traffic; nor did I take any photos of the humongous new condo building that's going up behind what was, in 1995, the newly-converted-to-loft-apartments Corset Factory, where I lived for the first six months of 1996. I didn't take any photos of the Corset Factory itself (though I did point out the seven 7-foot windows that bounded my corner apartment), and I didn't take any of the place where Sunshine Pizza used to be (but where it is no longer, apparently; either that, or my memory is faulty).
</p>
<p>
Since lunch at Sunshine Pizza was now out, we continued on to Stew Leonard's, arriving around 3:30pm. Had we not stopped to tour South Norwalk (without getting out of the car, mind you), we might have made it to Stew's in just over 5 hours. Woo hoo! Only 2 hours and a few minutes behind schedule! The Beaner was still sleeping, so I just ran in to Stew's to pee, though on the way out I had the brillant idea to check near the exit for brochures for local attractions. I hit on something better: A free tourist map of the area, which not only had ads for local hotels, but also marked their locations on the map. By the time I returned to the car with the map, the Beaner was awake and cranky, so I had a bizarre conversation with the reservationist at the Hilton Garden Inn over which phone number might be associated with my HHonors account (it turned out to be my old Macromedia # from 1997-2003) while the Beaner screamed in the background. Reservation secured, we went back into  Stew's to buy the coffee we'd come for, plus a few snacks.
</p>
<p>
Next stop: The hotel. On our way there, we noted the location of a couple drugstores where we could pick up supplies after checking in... and we also noticed that Norwalk seemed to have more than its fair share of places named for their owners. I remarked to Al that we should get some photos of said places on our way out of town the next morning. We then found the hotel (it was in the same area as the one I'd stayed in 11 years ago, though every hotel in the strip seemed relatively new), checked in, spent $62.90 at the CVS (luckily, it was all stuff we can totally use at home, too, like diapers and toothpaste and moisturizer), and then headed for the mall that our checkout lady at Stew's had recommended. Al and I each bought something to sleep in (the Beaner would sleep in the extra t-shirt I packed for him and then wear it the next day), and then we went back to the hotel and gave the Boopster a bath. Yep, I know&#8212;you totally envy us our lives of excitement and adventure.

Stew Leonard's, the reason for the trip. We made one more stop for extra bagels, salmon cream cheese, and fried scallops before turning for home.

<p>
The return trip took the expected 2 hours 45 minutes (or would have had we not detoured to the King of Prussia Mall to pick up some pants at Nordstrom and a chair at the Crate and Barrel). Traffic was brutal on I-76 East, so we took Ridge Pike back home. Sadly, the camera was now buried under a mound of crap, and we couldn't dig it out fast enough to get any photos of the weird and/or interesting signs along Ridge Pike (like the billboard ad for a funeral home that showed a kid selling high-speed internet access for $.25 at a former lemonade stand and  that said something about times changing... an example being that the funeral home had moved 7 miles down the road; and the bus stop bench that had a giant banner on it that said YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL). So I guess this entire boring story and its accompanying boring photos are by way of saying what I said to Al when he lamented that the Beaner wouldn't get to go swimming in the hotel pool: &quot;Well, it's not like this is a real vacation or anything. It's just an errand that took too long.&quot;

<h3 class="title">That Settles It</h3>

<p>
I was already pretty sure that I didn't want to drive down to North Carolina in what is already turning out to be an overscheduled October for my 20th high school reunion, but the invitation addressed to Lori Cho that arrived today cemented it for me. It just confirms that my classmates don't have any idea who I am.

<h3 class="title">How to Choose a Major</h3>

<p>
No one seems to want to listen to my assvice around here lately, so I've decided to share some with the broader Internet&#8212;and, more specifically, with those college-bound individuals who've yet to choose a major. There are probably many ways to go about this, but I wanted to share the way *I* did it because it's [a] simple, [b] logical, and [c] might surprise you. I know I was surprised by the outcome of this exercise when I did it back in 1986. (Yes, I'm OLD. Doesn't mean this isn't still a good idea.)
</p>



<p>
There've been a few times in my life where I've embarked on some new adventure without the least bit of planning, without knowing where I'm going, and without even knowing whether I've packed the right clothes. An example of this was the time I worked until 4am the day before leaving for a business trip to LA, called the airport shuttle service before leaving the office to arrange for a pickup "tomorrow" (because I hadn't been to bed yet), finally realized my mistake when the shuttle did not show up at 7am as requested, and then, when I arrived in LA, realized I had no idea where I was staying. Another example of this was the time I went off to orientation at the University of Georgia without any of my paperwork and with only a vague notion that I might want to major in psychology. I eventually thought to call an admin at the office from LAX and got the name of the conference hotel, and I managed at orientation without my paperwork, too, though both experiences probably would have been a lot more enjoyable had I planned ahead a little. 
</p>

<p>
I came back from orientation feeling stupid for not knowing who R.E.M. or The Smiths were, confused about how the bus system worked, wondering what I'd gotten myself into ("goooooo Dawgs, sic 'em, woof woof woof woof"?), and absolutely certain that I didn't want to major in psychology. (It turned out that a major in psychology also required several courses in biology, which I suck at, and sociology, which I'd become rather skeptical of after a less-than-satisfactory experience with it in high school.) Luckily, I also came home with a course catalog, and I decided to try an experiment.
</p>

<p>
I went through the course catalog and read the descriptions of every one of the courses on offer. (Well, OK, maybe I <em>skimmed</em> a few of the less interesting ones.) More importantly, I CIRCLED the ones that sounded interesting. When I was finished, I went back and counted up the circled courses under each department. At UGA at the time, one needed 8 courses at a certain level or above (I think it was 300 or 400) to constitute a major. There was only one department under which I'd circled more than 8 courses (more than 8 is important, because not all courses are offered every quarter/semester): English, where I'd circled 14. The runner-up was History, with 6.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly it was very clear where my interests lay and what my major should be. I even had a good idea that what I was really interested in were language and writing rather than literature. (The few literature courses I'd circled were things like Beowulf in the original Old English and Chaucer in the original Middle English.) Before I performed this exercise, I honestly didn't know that English was a major. I'd taken it every year in high school, obviously, but it never occurred to me that it was anything other than a compulsory step toward one's high school diploma, a requirement analogous to Consumer Ed. Finding out that <em>this</em> was what I was interested in was just cooler than cool. Also? All the other non-English courses that sounded interesting but didn't manage major status could be used to fulfill history, language, humanities, and science requirements, not to mention electives. Suddenly, I had a plan.
</p>

<p>
As I went through registration each year and tried to find classes with seats left that would fit my plan, I had to make adjustments, of course. Some of the English courses that sounded so interesting never came up during my junior or senior years, when I was eligible to take upper-level classes. I learned from taking one class that I liked the professor or the topic more than I thought, and so I added more like it; the opposite happened, too. It's important to be flexible as you go, and to recognize that what you thought was interesting as an entering freshman may not be what really floats your boat as a junior. Still, knowing what your educational options are <em>before</em> you start your first class will help you figure out where you're going.
</p>

<p>
So get out that course catalog (you've got one somewhere in that pile of orientation materials), grab a pen, and hunker down for an hour or two. You just might emerge with a major.
</p>

<h3 class="title">More Advice for the College Bound: On Career-Readiness</h3>

<p>
 I'd always planned to follow my <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/08/how_to_choose_a.html">How to Choose a Major</a> post with one on the fact that English is not a career-ready major, but thanks to a busy couple days of bugfixing and an even busier weekend of weeding, cleaning, furniture-moving, and toddler-wrangling, Pioneer Woman and Sheryle have managed to give a preview of my point in the comments on the Major post. Sheryle writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
...just take courses that you like until you've run out of time and are absolutely against the wall to be able to to graduate at all. So what major? Well, of course, the one you took the most courses in, just because they were so interesting and you're running out of time. This works well if you plan to go to graduate school and your major doesn't have to fit exactly or if you want multiple jobs in your life because they're interesting and not because they're part of your life track that included a specific, practical major.
</blockquote>
<p>
A &quot;specific, practical major&quot; was exactly what I wanted to talk about. If the reason you are going to college is so that you'll be able to get a good job&#8212;or a job in a particular field&#8212;right out of college, then my method of scanning the course catalog for what interests you (or Sheryle's method of just taking the classes that interest you as they come up, rather than circling your options ahead of time) is probably NOT the best way to go about choosing a major. 
</p>
<p>
It's probably worth noting that not many majors are &quot;career-ready&quot; in the sense that they'll prepare you for a high-paying, high-responsibility job right out of college. Yes, I know it'll come as a shock to many a 22 year-old, but chances are  that not many experienced executives are going to give your brilliant insights  much credence until you've tempered your enthusiasm with experience and maturity. Graduates of every stripe have to work their way up, no matter how smart they are. (As a matter of fact, the smarter you are, the more you probably need to be told to shut up and listen.) It's less about &quot;paying your dues&quot; than about gaining perspective and learning from those around you. Having said that, though, liberal arts (and even science) majors will likely have a tougher time getting on a career path than, say, computer science or landscape architecture majors.
</p>
<p>
Why? Because there's a big difference between <em>education</em> and <em>training</em>. As a liberal arts major, you'll have been educated, but you won't have been trained to do anything other than write well and think logically. (Yes, these are skills that everyone should have, and if you're an English, history, or philosophy major, you'll be appalled to find, when you arrive in the work world, how few of your colleagues can write a coherent sentence. At least you've got a leg up there.) The computer science major, on the other hand, has received the same basic education you have (i.e., she probably took the same core classes that you did), but she's also been trained in a specific field. She'll be able to put the programming languages,  object-oriented design techniques,  or systems design principles she's learned to immediate use somewhere, if she wants to. Yes, she'll start at the bottom, too, but an obvious career path (or at least, several obvious choices of career path) will be open to her.
</p>
<p>
You, the liberal arts major, on the other hand, could do just about anything&#8212;you just need a little  training in   a specific area to get started. For some, the thing to do is to put all you've learned about reading, writing, thinking, and studying to good use in graduate school, where, if you're lucky, you'll receive some training in a field as well as further education. For example, an English or philosophy degree is a perfect foundation for law school. You might even be able to go to medical school with such a foundation, provided you also took actual biology and chemistry courses and not just the botany and chemistry-for-non-science-majors courses that I took. You could get an MFA in creative writing, which is a good option if you really have no interest in a career at all, if you have a trust fund, or if you believe it's the best way to coax that million-dollar novel out of you. You could also do what everyone you meet asks if you're going to do&#8212;teach&#8212;and either get certified with just a B.A. or get an M.Ed. (For what it's worth, most teaching jobs require the Master's now.) 
</p>
<p>
If more schooling is not for you, your next task is to determine what *is* for you. If you opted for Sheryle's method of just taking whatever classes seemed interesting each quarter/semester&#8212;or my similar method of determining ahead of time where your interests lay&#8212;because it suited your personality, you're probably in for a bit of floundering. That's not necessarily a bad thing; in fact, I'd recommend embracing it as enthusiastically as possible so that the hours spent whining about your shit job are kept to a minimum. (I'd also recommend that you don't move to an expensive apartment in a big city with only $100 in your pocket and get a $99 speeding ticket on the way, as I did. It will severely limit your options.)
</p>
<p>
My point is, you're not going to be able to walk out of college and hit the ground running with an English degree. Just as you did when you entered college, you're going to need to take some time to discover what suits you. You might even discover that lots of things suit you, or that different things seem perfect at different times. Keep your ears open, be willing to try new things, and if at all possible, don't go deeply into debt. (Also: By all means figure out what your expenses are likely to be and what you'll need to make to cover them, but <span style="text-transform:uppercase">avoid justifying your salary requirements based on your expenses</span>. Do some research and find out what the starting salary range is for the job for which you are applying, consider your experience and skills, and base your asking price on that. If the prospective employer expresses surprise at the steep request, be prepared to tell him <em>what you can do for the company </em> that makes you worth the money.  Never forget that this isn't about what they can do for you, but what you can do for them.) 
</p>
<p>
This is your chance to discover that there are more jobs in the world than teacher, lawyer, doctor, and police officer. For example, it didn't occur to me until my last quarter of school that I could get paid to do something I did anyway, almost unconsciously&#8212;copy editing. Maybe you're interested in health care, biotech, or software development but have only your English or history or comparative literature degree. Consider leveraging the skills you already have&#8212;research, writing, editing,  analysis&#8212;to gain the skills you want by applying for a technical editor position at a biotech firm, a documentation writer position at a software company, or an internal communcations specialist position at healthcare company. (Granted, openings like these often require years of experience, but sometimes there are junior positions, contract positions, or internships available as well. The idea is to do something you're qualified for now while working toward the thing you want to try next.) 
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure I'd <em>recommend</em> it, exactly, but another option is to apply for an administrative or receptionist position at one of these companies. I worked as a temp when I first moved to Washington, DC, and although I felt frustrated and pigeonholed most of the time, it also led to an exciting job at the World Bank, where I gained tons of research, multimedia development, and communications skills, and where I discovered my next calling (something called the World Wide Web). A friend of mine started at Macromedia (now Adobe) as an admin, and 15 years later he's still with the company&#8212;as a top executive. Think only a man can do that? Another friend who was looking to change careers after leaving the foreign service took a temp position as the CEO's admin while his regular admin was away. The CEO was like, &quot;what the hell are you doing working as an admin?&quot; She answered simply, &quot;I wanted to move into software, and this seemed like a good way to start.&quot; When her temp stint was over, she moved into business development at the company&#8212;and totally rocked at it. Lesson here? If your resume doesn't have the skills or experience that you want to highlight on it, swallow your pride, start smaller, and show them what you can do.

<p>
Al took this photo of my sister and me with his cameraphone a couple weekends ago. Even though it's not the most flattering snap of either of us, I love it. Maybe it's the way we're interacting, or the fact that we're looking at the photos she took earlier that day, or that you can kinda see the resemblence between us. Whatever it is, I'm so glad he captured it.

<h3 class="title">Letter O</h3>

<p>
Here it is, my first attempt in years (seriously, like 10 years) to create multimedia. I used my cell phone to record a voice memo of the Beaner watching Prairie Dawn introduce the Letter of the Day to Cookie Monster (CM: &quot;Mmmm, cookie!&quot; PD: &quot;No, that is not a cookie, it's the letter of the day.&quot; CM: &quot;But that <em>look</em> like cookie.&quot; PD: &quot;Well, yes, yes it does.&quot; Prim Prairie Dawn is one of my favorite characters. :), and then I [a] e-mailed it to myself, [b] imported it into iMovie HD, [c] added titles so you'd know what the heck the Beaner was saying, and [d] exported it for the web. God knows if anyone will actually be able to see it. </p>

<h3 class="title">Here and There</h3>

<p>
The Beaner turns 21 months old today, and there WILL be an update later. I'm throwing down the gauntlet right now and declaring that I will not go to bed without posting one. (That's some incentive, because I seem to running on a sleep deficit that rivals the early days of parenthood. Well, maybe not THAT bad, but boy, is my ass dragging.)
</p>


<p>
In the meantime, you might want to check out <a href="http://lawmummy.typepad.com/phillymoms_dish/2006/08/dining_out_goji.html">a restaurant review</a> I posted at <a href="http://lawmummy.typepad.com/phillymoms_dish/">PhillyMoms Dish</a>, a new blog for parents raising kids in the City of Brotherly Love. (Yes, it's true, you <em>can</em> stay in the city after having kids!) I hope to be posting (or cross-posting) there fairly regularly on topics that would fit into both the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/parenthood/">parenthood</a> and <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/philadelphia/">philadelphia</a> categories here.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2006/08/great_shot_wher.html">geotagging</a>? <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/map/">SO ADDICTIVE</a>. Must. Stop. Now. (or else no work will get done today, and work must get done in order to allow time for blogging.)

<h3 class="title">Now *That's* Cold-Blooded</h3>

<p>
From Al: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/tech/D8JQS4L01.htm?sub=apn_tech_down&chan=tc">RadioShack lays off employees via e-mail</a>
</p>


<p>
Am I also cold-blooded for considering doing the same to the financial planner at Fidelity who didn't call me back after I left a message on Thursday, and who then called last night to berate me for choosing to deal with someone else at Fidelity's Philadelphia investor center instead? He actually said to me, about the colleague, "she <em>claimed</em> [emphasis his] that you said I never called you back." Me: "Uh, yeah. That's EXACTLY what I told her. Because you DIDN'T." He then <em>claimed</em> that he left not one but TWO messages for me, and that he didn't know how I couldn't have gotten them. I can't imagine where he left them, as I was home all day Thursday and Friday, was here until 3pm on Monday, there were no messages on our machine between Thursday and Tuesday, and we never once lost power during the entire span. Also, I'm fairly certain the Beaner never answered the phone and just forgot to give me the message.
</p>

<p>
All that would have been bad enough, but then he tried to just take over the account right there. "So what else can I help you with? I know [colleague] did a <em>basic</em> portfolio review, but I'm sure I could [blah blah blah something or other]." At this point I held the phone away from my ear and just stared at it for a second. Dude, is your pride that wounded? After the big speech about how you don't work on commission yadda yadda yadda, it's that big a deal that I pressed 0 and asked to work with the person who answered when I got your voicemail again on Tuesday? And hello, did you think to ask me if this was even a good time to talk? No! And by the way, IT'S NOT.
</p>

<p>
When I finally stopped staring at the phone in disbelief and returned it to my ear, I said, "listen, I'm actively trying to fix a bug with someone at this very minute, and it's extremely complicated, and I can't focus any attention on my IRA right now." What I should have said is, "listen, I can't talk right now anyway, but even if I could, I think I'd like to keep dealing with your colleague." It's what I want to say today. Am I wrong to want to say it via e-mail, instead of being shouted at again on the phone? I'm thinking that even if I am, it's my style. I'd much rather answer a phone call with an e-mail any day of the week. It's partly what makes me an introvert. Maybe the CEO and head of HR at Radio Shack are introverts, too.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Month 21: Repeat After Me</h3>

<p>
Even if I hadn't skipped the 20 month update, there'd be a lot to write about this month. It hardly seems like the first week of August and the last have anything in common development-wise; if I'd written this update two weeks ago, everything would have been different. When we started this month, for example, the Beaner was still calling milk &quot;mama&quot;. Now he says something that sounds more like the Swedish word for milk than the English one, but it's very clear that he's saying &quot;milk&quot; even when there's no milk nearby to help you guess from the context.
</p>


<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/205784596/" title="Photo Sharing"class="special"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/74/205784596_a129d04601.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="mama is his word for milk" /></a>
</p>
<p>
Context is still pretty important in most cases; though he knows how to say &quot;water&quot;, he prefers to call it &quot;li'lo&quot;&#8212;a word that's extremely similar to his words for stroller and Toyota. Sometimes it's necessary to scan the block for Toyotas, ask him if he's thirsty, and determine whether he's complaining that he'd rather be in the black stroller than the blue one in quick succession. Similarly, &quot;momo&quot; could mean BMW (he'll repeat the letters when we say them), watermelon, banana, or more. Meanwhile, he seems to be adding 5-10 new words a day to the mix, and not all of them are particularly clear. Most of the time we know what he's saying because he's repeating what we've just said&#8212;&quot;umbrella&quot;, &quot;cottage cheese&quot;, &quot;time for dinner&quot;&#8212;but sometimes he waits until hours or days later to spout a word he's heard us say back at us. The other night he climbed all over the bed intoning, &quot;ben one, ben one, ben one&quot;, and I had to tell him that I had no idea what &quot;ben one&quot; was. He seemed rather put out by this; his face twisted into a grimace of consternation. It was only two nights later that I realized he'd been looking for the stuffed <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/archives/2003/06/miss_boops_meet.html">penguin</a> that usually sits atop our headboard (he grabbed it and cheered, &quot;yay! ben one!&quot;).

We're getting a few previews of the Terrible Twos around here; the tantrums can be loud, lusty, and long, and there've definitely been times where I lost it and started crying, too. Most of the time we're able to switch to Ignore mode, though, and he gets over whatever pissed him off on his own. Sometimes he even gets over it before he really gets started. Instead of throwing himself on the floor when he wants to have a fit, he has this hilarious habit of lying down <em>ever so carefully</em> and then positioning his legs <em>just so</em> for ease of kicking. By the time he gets all situated, he realizes he has everyone's bemused attention (he's fond of using the lie-down technique in public places), and he sort of kicks half-heartedly while gracing us all with an evil grin. I feel like his straight man when I announce loudly, &quot;oh, are you going to tantrum now? OK, then, be careful you don't bump your head.&quot;

<br />

Bottom: Wearing his Whole Foods lettuce hat; using both steering wheels at Home Depot. 
</p>
<p>
The fact that we're approaching two years old also has its upsides: in addition to the increased vocabulary, there's also more to do. He can run (the other night he ran all the way home&#8212;in a series of 50-yard dashes&#8212;from the Barnes and Noble on Rittenhouse Square), he's learning how to jump (he hasn't quite got the action of bending his knees and lifting both feet at once; instead he either scissor-leaps, or he free-falls with both legs together like he's participating in a trust exercise), and he's also learning how to drive (well, steer). And though he hasn't quite outgrown the <a href="http://www.pleasetouchmuseum.org/">Please Touch Museum</a> yet, he's just as interested in the science exhibits at the <a href="http://www2.fi.edu/">Franklin Institute</a>. 
</p>
<p>
We learned last month that there are a few things he actively dislikes (and that totally freak him out), like the creepy Humpty Dumpty that appeared in a Sesame Street segment one morning, and anything else with a smile that seems overly large, fake, and slightly predatory, but for the most part he's pretty fearless at this stage. He can go up or down two flights of stairs without assistance (and he often does; I pretty much let him wander around the house as he pleases and only follow after he's had a few minutes on his own). He regularly climbs onto couches, chairs, stepstools, and ladders, too.
</p>

<br />
Al's actually trying to get him to come down, not helping him up.<br /> 
Believe it or not, he climbed all of those rungs himself.
</p>
<p>
As I write this I'm realizing all the ways the Beaner is  like a sponge these days, and it's impossible to chronicle them all. The other problem (compounded by the fact that I skipped last month's entry) is that his skills are getting so deep and multilayered now it's hard to tell exactly when something started. We've been, consciously or unconsciously, showing him how to do things for months; when he noticed the patterns, and when he started repeating them, isn't always easy to distinguish. It's also true that he often makes a huge leap forward and then reverts to his old behavior for days or weeks before repeating the new behavior again. I intend to press on, however, and cover a few more anecdotes and milestones before I post and go to sleep.

<br />
The Beaner's two favorite activities: reading and watching Sesame Street 
</p>
<p>
Last night after bathtime, we were watching Sesame Street while lying on our bed as we normally do. Al laid down next to us and started talking to me about our budget and finances, and he and I started having a pretty serious discussion. Prairie Dawn and Cookie Monster were shrieking at each other about cookies in the background, and it all got a bit too noisy for me&#8212;I felt like Al and I had to shout at each other to be heard, and I didn't want the shouting to accidentally turn into a fight, so I grabbed the TiVo remote and hit the pause button so Al and I could try to keep a conversation about a touchy subject (for me, anyway) calm and reasonable. I only got about two words into my next sentence before the Beaner had retrieved the remote and resumed playing Sesame Street. We stopped our conversation for a moment, congratulated him for navigating the complex TiVo remote correctly, and then just turned the volume down.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Last month the Beaner inherited a push trike from his cousin Henry, but he wasn't interested in riding it until recently. I'm not sure whether he's just more interested in wheeled things now, or whether he likes the idea of steering (though, thankfully, the front wheel locks, so it only requires minor adjustments to keep him moving forward without crashing), or whether he wants to show that he's a Big Boy, but he now enjoys taking the bike with us occasionally when we go on evening walks. He has a word for it that we understand as &quot;bicycle&quot; (he uses the same word when pointing at Hannah's bike, for example), but I'm not sure I could spell it phonetically right now. Too tired.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

</p>
<p>
Speaking of wheeled things, the Beaner has learned to recognize a bunch of new car models since I last wrote about <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/08/brand_recogniti.html">his auto obsession</a>,  including Hyundai, Kia, Pontiac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Cadillac, Mini (&quot;mi-mee&quot;), Lexus, GMC (&quot;abc&quot;), Subaru, and probably a few others I'm not remembering now. Al taught him to call a Mercedes a &quot;benz&quot; (easier to say than Mercedes), and he now refers to Mitsubishis by their full names rather than by &quot;mitsu&quot; or &quot;bishi&quot;. Oh, and he calls Volkswagens &quot;VW&quot; instead of just &quot;W&quot;... though I fear we may have been too insistent on correcting him there: He now says &quot;VW&quot; for every letter W he sees.  At first I thought the proximity of V and W in the alphabet might be confusing him, but he proved me wrong when my favorite Seattle alphabet segment came on Sesame Street, and he repeated the letters as T! U! V! VW! X! Y! Z! We're still working on separating V and W for him; I think the fact that W also appears in BMW with no V sound in sight is helping.
</p>

<br />
Pointing out cars on 21st Street 
</p>
<p>
The Beaner isn't just into cars and letters, by the way: He also loves to count. He pulled on the doors of the Please Touch Museum when we passed by on a family walk one night, and I said, &quot;they closed at 4:30, honey, and it's 7.&quot; The Beaner responded, &quot;8! 9! 10!&quot; He does this pretty much any time a number comes up in conversation these days&#8212;he'll give the next three or four numbers after the one you mentioned, and then say &quot;ah, ah, ah!&quot; in a Transylvanian accent. It's pretty cute when he says &quot;one Volvo! Two Volvos! Ah, ah, ah!&quot; I think the modifying with numbers has helped him learn to modify with other adjectives as well; for example, he now identifies the black stroller (his favorite), says he wants a juicy peach, points out orange taxis, differentiates between the green watering can and the orange one, and knows that mangos and watermelon make him sticky. I guess most of his adjectives are colors (&quot;purple Jeep! red Jeep! black Jeep!&quot;) or numbers, but he seems to delight in learning new ones like juicy, sticky, crunchy, and messy.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and one last thing: He knows his name now. Al told me he'd said it out loud a couple times this week, but today I heard it for myself. He pointed to me and said, &quot;Mommy&quot; (something he started calling me yesterday, in addition to the usual &quot;Mom&quot; or &quot;Ma&quot;), and then he pointed to Hannah and said, &quot;Ann-nah&quot;, and then he pointed to himself and said, &quot;Awh-toon&quot;.

<h3 class="title">Thursday Miscellany</h3>

<p>
I may be adding to this post as the day goes on; random thoughts that aren't worthy of entire blog posts keep popping into my brain.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Al's back has been killing him from lifting/carrying the Beaner so much, to the point where he was barely able to hobble back and forth to work yesterday. Consequently, I did all the lifting/carrying yesterday (well, the parts that happen before and after Hannah arrives, anyway). Guess whose back is hurting today?</li>
<li>Last night I had a dream where two different children approached me and acted as if they were mine. They weren't really talking yet, but all their grunts and gestures indicated familiarity. It was clear they were claiming me. Both times, the parents of the child came up to me a few minutes later and explained that their babies had been switched at birth (not with each other&#8212;the two families were totally separate and unrelated), and that ever since, the child had instinctively been searching out its "real" mom. After the second set of parents told me this story, I remarked, "I had no idea baby switching was so common!" Both families were East Asian or possibly Northern African, and both children were girls.</li>
<li>It drives me totally nuts that you can't search your Movable Type entries based on whether comments are open or closed. Ideally, I'd like a way to turn off comments on posts as a batch operation, but failing that, I'd at least like to search for posts on which comments are open. (I seem to remember that there was an MT plugin that automatically turned off comments on older posts; I should see if anything like that exists for MT3.2.)</li>
<li>Even if you don't care about Seattle parks at all, it's worth reading Matthew Baldwin's piece on the subject at the <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/a_walk_in_the_park/seattle.php">Morning News</a> for the section on Ravenna &amp; Cowen Parks, which contains this little snort-inducing gem:
<blockquote>
Occasionally we would round a bend in the trail and find a full-scale melee in progress around the running path. Upon seeing us, one of the combatants would shout “Reality!” and everyone would lower their weapons and step aside, allowing us to pass. (The idea of shouting “Reality!” during one of our staff meetings at work has occurred to me more than once.)
</blockquote></li>
<li>Since our lives are so fully integrated now, I find that I don't post separately at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/">lori-and-al</a> anymore. (Would this have happened had we not had a kid, I wonder? Probably.) I'm trying to decide whether to shut down that blog and redesign the lori-and-al site so that it's just an archive of all the old stuff, or whether to import all the lori-and-al posts into avocado8. It's hard to think through all the consequences of integration ahead of time; I remember at one point I thought it was a good idea to put all the old hockey blog entries into Movable Type, but in the end it didn't feel right at all. For the sake of simplicity, I'll probably just go the archive route.</li>
<li>Via Sweetney: <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/08/30/keith-olbermann-delivers-one-hell-of-a-commentary-on-rumsfeld/">Keith Olbermann Delivers One Hell Of a Commentary on Rumsfeld</a>. The audio on the WMV version I watched sucked, but the commentary was nothing if not forceful and well-argued. It's also very dense, so it bears watching a second time.</li>
</ul>
