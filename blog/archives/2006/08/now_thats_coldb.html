<h3 class="title">Now *That's* Cold-Blooded</h3>

<p>
From Al: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/tech/D8JQS4L01.htm?sub=apn_tech_down&chan=tc">RadioShack lays off employees via e-mail</a>
</p>

<p>
Am I also cold-blooded for considering doing the same to the financial planner at Fidelity who didn't call me back after I left a message on Thursday, and who then called last night to berate me for choosing to deal with someone else at Fidelity's Philadelphia investor center instead? He actually said to me, about the colleague, "she <em>claimed</em> [emphasis his] that you said I never called you back." Me: "Uh, yeah. That's EXACTLY what I told her. Because you DIDN'T." He then <em>claimed</em> that he left not one but TWO messages for me, and that he didn't know how I couldn't have gotten them. I can't imagine where he left them, as I was home all day Thursday and Friday, was here until 3pm on Monday, there were no messages on our machine between Thursday and Tuesday, and we never once lost power during the entire span. Also, I'm fairly certain the Beaner never answered the phone and just forgot to give me the message.
</p>

<p>
All that would have been bad enough, but then he tried to just take over the account right there. "So what else can I help you with? I know [colleague] did a <em>basic</em> portfolio review, but I'm sure I could [blah blah blah something or other]." At this point I held the phone away from my ear and just stared at it for a second. Dude, is your pride that wounded? After the big speech about how you don't work on commission yadda yadda yadda, it's that big a deal that I pressed 0 and asked to work with the person who answered when I got your voicemail again on Tuesday? And hello, did you think to ask me if this was even a good time to talk? No! And by the way, IT'S NOT.
</p>

<p>
When I finally stopped staring at the phone in disbelief and returned it to my ear, I said, "listen, I'm actively trying to fix a bug with someone at this very minute, and it's extremely complicated, and I can't focus any attention on my IRA right now." What I should have said is, "listen, I can't talk right now anyway, but even if I could, I think I'd like to keep dealing with your colleague." It's what I want to say today. Am I wrong to want to say it via e-mail, instead of being shouted at again on the phone? I'm thinking that even if I am, it's my style. I'd much rather answer a phone call with an e-mail any day of the week. It's partly what makes me an introvert. Maybe the CEO and head of HR at Radio Shack are introverts, too.

<p>My last company layed me off via Email. Perfect timing too. I'd just broken up with the woman I was living with. It was my first night in a new apartment with no phone or Intertubes access so I read my email on my Cel phone and was layed off.</p>

<p>The jerk in your story doesn't want your business, why extend him any courtesy at this point? I hope you've emailed him and moved on.</p>
