<p>Ugh.  We had that heat spell here in CA two weeks before.  It was unbearable!!  My house is so well insulated that once it got hot inside (100 degrees), it stayed hot even when it finally cooled off outside.  You have my sympathies.</p>

<p>The good news is that unlike our Moutain View house, our Philadelphia house has central air conditioning.  The bad news is it's a 3-story (4 if you count the basement) row house, which means the upstairs gets HOT when the temp outside is over 85.</p>

<p>Please send some of the heat our way!  It has been quite cool here, unusual for Victoria and I am in need of heat!  Rob brought home more holiday brochures this week as I think he is in need of heat as well.  Hard to believe that we were in Bali only a few months ago!  I think Mexico is on the books for early December though....that is unless you send the heat this way!  </p>

<p>Love reading your blog!</p>

<p>oooh, I envy you your cool. I loved the weather in San Jose (CA), which was about 55F and overcast in the morning, and then about 75F and sunny in the afternoon, though I could live -- and did, for the 5 years I lived in San Francisco -- with 50s and 60s in the summer.</p>

<p>will you be going to a new spot in Mexico, or an old haunt?<br />
