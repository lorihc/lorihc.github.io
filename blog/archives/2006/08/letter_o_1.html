<h3 class="title">Letter O</h3>

<p>
Here it is, my first attempt in years (seriously, like 10 years) to create multimedia. I used my cell phone to record a voice memo of the Beaner watching Prairie Dawn introduce the Letter of the Day to Cookie Monster (CM: &quot;Mmmm, cookie!&quot; PD: &quot;No, that is not a cookie, it's the letter of the day.&quot; CM: &quot;But that <em>look</em> like cookie.&quot; PD: &quot;Well, yes, yes it does.&quot; Prim Prairie Dawn is one of my favorite characters. :), and then I [a] e-mailed it to myself, [b] imported it into iMovie HD, [c] added titles so you'd know what the heck the Beaner was saying, and [d] exported it for the web. God knows if anyone will actually be able to see it. </p>

<p>Quite adorable, but...I have to say my favorite part is Austen's laugh. Hearing a child laugh reminds me it's not all that bad!</p>

<p>Aw, that's sweet. I actually started out by trying to record his laugh -- we'd been playing in the tub right before this, and he was laughing up a storm -- but this one had so many "clear" words on it I decided to convert this one to a movie first. I'll go back and re-listen to the tub recordings and see if I captured the laugh properly. If not, I'll get Al to tickle him and try again. :)</p>

<p>Hah!  So sweet.</p>

<p>The Toddler hates it when Cookie Monster eats the letter of the day, I think because it upsets Prairie Dawn.  So it's nice that more of whatever that day's letter is appear immediately afterward, in another sketch.</p>
