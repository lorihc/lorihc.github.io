<h3 class="title">Five Things</h3>

<p>
Just made my weekly visit to <a href="http://foggyknit.blogspot.com/2006/08/five-things_04.html">foggyknit's site</a> and realized I'd been tagged for this:
</p>
<p>
Five things in my freezer:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Three boxes of Morningstar Farms veggie sausages, which Austen and I love</li>
<li>Trader Joe's tropical fruit medley, for smoothies</li>
<li>A bazillion different kinds of frozen vegetables</li>
<li>Three ice packs and two First Aid Friends (small icepacks shaped like teddy bear faces), which Al and I call boo-boo buddies in violation of somebody's trademark</li>
<li>Four Smart Ones meals that I will probably never get around to eating.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Five things in my closet (my clothes closet in the bedroom):
</p>
<ol>
<li>A gorgeous new BCBG Max Azaria dress that made me feel SO PRETTY that I couldn't *not* buy it</li>
<li>A beautiful full-length satin purple skirt about which I said the same thing four years ago, and have yet to wear</li>
<li>My Starbucks card, $5 in cash, and my Metropolitan Bakery bread card, which I take with me on my morning walks</li>
<li>A bunch of baby sweaters on hangers that will probably be too small for Austen by the time it gets cold enough to wear them</li>
<li>5 pairs of pants that don't fit right, and 3 that do.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Five items in the car:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Three CDs labeled Austen Car II, Austen Car III Disc One, and Austen Car III Disc Two. We're still trying to figure out his musical tastes.</li>
<li>A compass, just in case.</li>
<li>An emergency diaper and wipes.</li>
<li>A box of Kleenex.</li>
<li>Four half-drunk water bottles.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Five items in my purse (I just cleaned it out, so these five items constitue almost its entire contents):
</p>
<ol>
<li>Visine Tears eye drops</li>
<li>$42 in cash</li>
<li>An Elexa condom purse that I got at BlogHer, and that I'm using for a change purse instead</li>
<li>My Adobe ID (and Juliana's, which I borrowed for its Caltrain sticker)</li>
<li>Natural Ice lip balm.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Tagging <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~vbg/blog/">Val</a> and <a href="http://ratphooey.livejournal.com/">ratphooey</a> (who probably already did this two years ago).

<p>See the next post for more on the dress. I do hope to get Al to take a few photos of me in it next time I put it on. If it's anytime soon, I'll probably convert the photos to black &amp; white or sepia rather than color, though. I tried it on for my sister on Sunday, and she declared that my purple hair clashes. Wouldn't want that to mess up anyone's impression of the dress. :)</p>
