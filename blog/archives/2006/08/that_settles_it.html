<h3 class="title">That Settles It</h3>

<p>
I was already pretty sure that I didn't want to drive down to North Carolina in what is already turning out to be an overscheduled October for my 20th high school reunion, but the invitation addressed to Lori Cho that arrived today cemented it for me. It just confirms that my classmates don't have any idea who I am.

<p>I considered that as a possibility. (Do mailmerges really not understand hyphens?) I still prefer to think of it as a sign. ;)<br />

<p>At least you get about two months notice! I received an e-mail about my 20th reunion two weeks prior. Your classmates may not know who you are, but I don't think mine even like me!</p>

<p>I'm going to go to mine (next summer) in part to see the monstrosity that is North Dakota hair. At the 10-year they were still doing the tsunami bangs. Zoicks.</p>
