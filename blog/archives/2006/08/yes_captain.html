<h3 class="title">Yes, Captain</h3>

<p>
As a kid, I was NOT a fan of Star Trek. I WAS a fan of Star Wars, and it used to bug me royally when people would confuse the two or mistake me for a Trekkie. After I married Al, however, Star Trek started to grow on me a little. It's still probably not a show I'd ever watch on my own, but I enjoy watching it with Al, who explains all the relationships between the characters and the significance of the plots, the gadgets, and the locations to me as we're watching. I like that <em>he</em> likes it, and that I can understand each episode without having to watch every other episode. His enthusiasm for it is contagious, at least for the duration of an episode.
</p>
<p>
So all that's by way of saying, if I'd come across this quiz on <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/ratphooey/">ratphooey's blog</a> before I met Al, I would have just moved on to the next blog in my RSS reader. But because I read it today, after almost 4 years of marriage to Al and a good number of Star Trek episodes from each generation, I clicked the link to take the quiz. Here are the results:

Interestingly, the first time I took it, it came up as a tie between completely expendable redshirt guy and Jean Luc Picard, but for some reason redshirt trumped Picard, and I only got to see the description of Mr. Expendable. After reading the description, however, I figured out which factor to adjust*, and I knocked it down a notch to get the Picard description, which actually sounds a bit more like me. :)
</p>

<p style="font-size:smaller">
*I'd put ABSOLUTELY YES for "Do you often go unnoticed?", which was probably a stretch. My reason for doing so was that people often bump into me&#8212;physically bump into me&#8212;and then seem startled, like they hadn't seen me walking down the street toward them until they ran right into me. However, I think it's not an ABSOLUTELY YES situation, since there are probably ten times as many people who *do* notice me as who slam into me as if I were invisible. Thus I think the Picard designation is probably the right one, and Expendable Guy probably shouldn't even be ranked as high as he is.

<p>You are tall and stunning and have purple hair.  Who on earth could possibly NOT notice you?</p>

<p>You're a total Picard.  :-)</p>

<p>Have you ever seen "Galaxy Quest"? The expendable guy's name really is Guy. So best.</p>

<p>I have seen Galaxy Quest, but I'd forgotten about Guy. Funny movie!</p>

<p>I remain, since 1980, strictly a Star Wars fan. Any talk about Star Trek ends up sounding like the adults in a Peanuts special.</p>

<p>Sorry.</p>

<p>No need to apologize. I still see Star Wars and Star Trek as totally and completely unrelated (and I confess I'm a bit unsure of who a few of the characters on the list are).</p>

<p>Oh fart, it looks like they've taken it down. (I got the link directly from the site -- it was in the "paste this into your website!" code they provided.)</p>
