<h3 class="title">Networking</h3>

<p>
I still haven't made my way to the sites of all the women I met at BlogHer, partly because my blog-reading time is limited by work and family obligations, and partly because as I read each woman's site, I end up getting sidetracked by her archives and photos and links to other sites. I'm finding myself down fascinating side roads this way.
</p>
<p>
Today I finally made it to <a href="http://electrolicious.com/">Ariel's site</a> and discovered that [a] she's probably the reason <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/201046027/">one of my Flickr photos</a> has over 600 views, about 6 times more than the rest of my "popular" photos, and [b] she came up with a great way to share details from all the interesting conversations she had at BlogHer without violating any confidences. Check out <a href="http://www.electrolicious.com/archives/2006/07/blogher_the_game_1.html">BlogHer, The game!</a>.

<p>I had a similarly weird moment when all of a sudden <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ariel/20308346">one of my BlogHer photos</a> had over FIVE THOUSAND hits. And it wasn't even an especially interesting photo! I was like "What in the holy hell...?" A quick technorati search revealed that Heather Armstrong had linked it. Dang. Crazy LinkHers.</p>

<p>Deeelicious to meet you at BlogHer. And thanks for the kudos on BlogHer, The Game. I'm a huge gossip and I just can't not spill my beans.</p>

<p>It was great to meet you, too -- you give good gab. ;) A few stories from BlogHer are still weighing on me, but there's just no way to share them without someone getting hurt (even if I disguised the participants), so for now -- and probably forever -- only Al and Hannah, our nanny, have heard them. </p>

<p>Congratulations on your second wedding anniversary, btw!</p>

<p>I was going to ask you about that, but I was one of the ones who'd clicked the link on Dooce's site, so I knew which one you meant. ;) </p>
