<h3 class="title">Terminology</h3>

<p>
Last Friday morning I stopped, as I sometimes do while out on my morning walk, at the Metropolitan Bakery. I noticed a small quiche in the 1/2 price basket, inspected it carefully to try to determine its exact ingredients, and finally decided I'd have to ask. <em>Hmmm,</em> I thought to myself, <em>what if they consider this a tart and not a quiche? Wouldn't want to offend anyone by using such a common term as </em>quiche.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>Excuse me, can you tell me what kind of tart this is?<br />
<strong>Nasty Young Gentleman Behind Counter: </strong>What kind of <em>quiche</em> is it? I think it's shittake mushroom, possibly with artichokes.

<p>You didn't need to, though -- linebreaks are added automatically. ;)</p>

<p>I think you're right that it's a guy thing. Shopping is much more purposeful with guys... and, for some reason, my mom&#8212;which is probably why I always say I hate shopping. She used to pick one day in August for us to go shopping for school clothes, and we had to get everything on THAT DAY. I came to dread being forced to disrobe and try things on over and over again, and I don't like it to this day. One visit to the dressing room per month is more than enough for me.</p>

<p>On a somewhat-related note, one of the biggest favors anyone ever did for me was when my good friend and roommate Pat Serino stuck me in a dressing room at Nordstrom and then brought in about 30 different articles of clothing for me to try on. It probably took less than an hour, I only had to take my shoes off once, and by the time we were done I had an excellent idea of what cuts worked on my body and how much I'd need to pay for clothes that were office-appropriate (this was back when I worked office jobs in Washington, DC). Pat had both good fashion sense and knowledge of the DC dress code, which of course helped tremendously, but any honest friend would do just as well.</p>

<p>I almost cannot shop with the spousage.  We have very different ideas about what this means.</p>

<p>I want to see pictures of your new dress and shoes!  Or even you in them, should you care to do a little recreational modeling.</p>

<p>*sigh*  I loved that building.  Or I did when it was  still Wanamaker's.  How is it these days?  Was the giant roach an aberation, or was the whole place crumbling?  It always seemed a shadow of its former self, but it had a grace about it, too.  Is the boar still there?  Does anyone play the organ?</p>
