<h3 class="title">The Return of the Pink</h3>

<p>
Ugh, it's that time of year again: The time when every building and fountain in Philadephia is lit up with pink. Stores sell bears in pink t-shirts (with a whole $4.50 from your purchase going toward breast cancer charities!) and tea with pink ribbons on the cannister and pink-enameled kitchen appliances. We're urged to <a href="http://www.thinkbeforeyoupink.org/Pages/ParadeOfPink.html">buy! buy! buy!</a> in the name of breast cancer.
</p>
<p>
Here's an idea: If you don't need the teddy bear or the pedicure slippers or the boxing gloves (!), why not make a direct donation to a <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?keyword_list=Breast+Cancer&bay=search.results&cgid=5&cuid=&location=2&stid=&city=&Submit=Submit&sortby=rtg">breast cancer charity</a>? (Link goes to a list of well-run breast cancer charities, as ranked by <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm">Charity Navigator</a>.) Even if you give a tiny amount&#8212;say, $10 or $20&#8212;you're still giving more than you would be by buying most pink-ribbon products. Instead of mailing four pink yogurt lids in to Yoplait (you'd be spending 39 cents on the stamp to give 40 cents to the <a href="http://www.komen.org/intradoc-cgi/idc_cgi_isapi.dll?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=307">Susan G. Komen foundation</a>), mail $5 directly to Komen... if Komen is the organization you want to support.
</p>

<p>
If you really would rather buy a breast health-related product than send money directly to a charity, please consider buying something that doesn't pander with pink. A <a href="http://www.breastofcanada.com/order.php">sepia-toned calendar</a> produced by <a href="http://www.breastofcanada.com/">Breast of Canada</a> is one option. Not a whit of pink in sight, and real, actual breasts on every page. (You'd be surprised how shocking it is to see REAL breasts, after what we're used to seeing in advertisements, on television, and in movies. Seriously: it's shocking. Sue Richards gave me a sample calendar when I met her at BlogHer, so I've seen all the images. <a href="http://www.breastofcanada.com/newsletter04Oct.html">This article</a> on the Breast of Canada website gives a good sense of how different this calendar is from the traditional pinup version you'd see in a gas station repair bay.) If nothing else, the calendar will make you appreciate the healthy breasts you have, and help you keep them healthy with reminders and instructions on how to do breast self-exams.
</p>

<p>
If all this pink makes you angry, as it does me; if all the sweetness and light and positive pinkness seems incongruous with the vomit-inducing toxicity of current cancer treatments; if you find it disconcerting that many breast cancer organizations are sponsored by chemical and pharmaceutical companies; if you want to find out what's CAUSING breast cancer and work to PREVENT it, not just detect and treat it, start by <a href="http://www.bcaction.org/Pages/GetInformed/Top10Myths.html">educating yourself</a>, and then <a href="http://www.bcaction.org/Pages/TakeAction/Campaigns.html">take action</a>. Give yourself a breast exam. Eliminate harmful chemicals from your household, and lobby for a cleaner environment for yourself and your children. Whatever you do, don't just shop.

<p>Amen, sister! I get fairly disgusted with the commercialization of causes anymore. I'm always reminded of the "Seinfeld" episode where Kramer signed up for the AIDS Walk but didn't want to wear a red ribbon. The woman at the sign-up table kept pushing him to wear it and he called her a Ribbon Nazi (ha! ha!). I certainly understand the need for funding to eradicate illness and disease, but I begin to wonder when corporate America seems a bit too interested in becoming involved. Cynical, I know, but that's the beauty of the circus that is my psyche!!</p>

<p>Cynical, maybe, but I think you've hit the nail on the head. For many companies, it's more about how pink-ribbon marketing can increase sales and brand-awareness than actually finding the causes and cure for breast cancer. Take this one example:</p>

<p>"In a 2005 PR Week article, 3M touted that its 2004 breast cancer awareness effort, involving a 70-foot-tall ribbon made of Post-it Notes in Times Square, reached more than 3 million people and increased sales 80% over expectations. The article reports that 3M spent $500,000 on the marketing campaign (no actual numbers on profits were released), but only gave a little over half of that amount ($300,000) to the cause."<br />
