<h3 class="title">3 Days</h3>

<p>
I left for <a href="http://www.adobe.com/events/max/">MAX</a>2006 in Las Vegas early Tuesday morning, before The Beaner woke up, and returned last night a little before midnight, long after he went to bed. While at the conference, I attended a few CSS sessions; talked to a lot of customers (something I realized I hadn't done&#8212;face-to-face, anyway&#8212;in three or four years); took lots of notes and filed a few bugs based on what I saw and heard; battled a cold, dehydration, and noxious clouds of cigarette smoke; saw the feature I've been working on get sneaked to a crowd of about 3500; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/279676853/">danced</a> the night (or at least the evening) away at the Palms; got to wear the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/279671234/in/photostream/">new shirt</a> I spent a fortune on (because Al convinced me that I needed one good shirt, and damned if he wasn't right&#8212;the thing fit really well and made me feel great); walked to the Bellagio to see all the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/chihuly/">Chihuly glass</a> and to Walgreen's to buy Airborne (both walks took waaaaay longer than I'd anticipated, due to map scale being nothing like reality and sidewalks being clogged with shuffling tourists); and got to see many <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/278868655/">old friends</a>, many of whom I didn't realize would be at the conference. (I wish I had more photos of all the old friends and cool customers I met, but I was so busy talking to them I kept forgetting to whip out the camera.)
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, at home, The Beaner was changing. When I called from the cab to the airport yesterday, he didn't want to sing the Happy Birthday song he'd been rehearsing with Hannah all day, but he was more than happy to tell me, "I painted choochoo train!" and "Bye bye, Mommy! I love you, Mommy!"
</p>

<p>
When I went to get him from his crib this morning (at 8:02am), he felt skinnier, and longer. He was even more talkative than when I left, and his enunciation had improved. "What happened to Baab?" he asked me when I brought him downstairs. "What happened to Buick?" I said I didn't know, I'd been away. "Here ya go, mommy. It's Big Bird," he replied, handing me his Big Bird doll, perhaps as a welcome home gift.
</p>

<p>
He laughed and made little jokey references to a new book he and Hannah got at the library while I was gone (it involves sound effects, and he'd try one out and then smile slyly, waiting to see if we noticed and could identify it). He counted his shoes for me. He yelled, "yaaay! chocolate!" when I unwrapped the 88% cacao chocolate bar that Hannah got me for my birthday (she also got me a cool mug with caricatures of women authors&#8212;including Jane Austen&#8212;on it, and some decaf Kona coffee beans). He kissed me and said, "bye, Mommy" when I left at 9am for a massage, and he gave me hugs and asked to be picked up whenever I came down to the kitchen throughout the day, seemingly more to make sure that I knew he loved me than the other way around.
</p>

<p>
It's been an amazing three days. It's good to be home.

<p>Sound like you had a great time. What a gas to have your work shown in a big crowd like that. You're just like a rock star.</p>

<p>Happy belated birthday.</p>
