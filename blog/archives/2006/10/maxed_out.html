<h3 class="title">MAXed Out</h3>

<p>
Gah, I have SO MUCH to blog about, and no time to do it&#8212;maybe on the plane tomorrow. I'm leaving for <a href="http://www.adobe.com/events/max/">Adobe MAX</a> in Las Vegas tomorrow morning, and I'll be gone until late, late Thursday night (yes, I'll be spending half my birthday at a conference, and the other half on a plane). I want to write about the little point-and-shoot camera I just got (a <a href="http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital/lineup/f30/index.html">Finepix F30</a>) this morning so I could have something to carry around in my purse (and also something I could bring to events like MAX, where I don't want to lug around the 10D in addition to two laptops). I want to write about our TWO recent apple-picking outings. I have two hockey games to write about, plus a practice tonight.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and somewhere in there I need to pack... and work. Yikes!

<p>I've got a FinePix, and it does indeed take fine pics.  I keep it in my purse or my pocket.  Almost all of my Flickr photos were taken with it. (I feel sort of sheepish even mentioning Flickr--don't blame the camera; it's the nut behind the wheel.) </p>

<p>So, happy birthday! So many Scorpios! (Both my siblings and my son.)</p>
