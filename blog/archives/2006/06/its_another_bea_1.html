<h3 class="title">It's Another Beautiful Day in Philadelphia</h3>

<p>
As <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/archives/2003/09/beautiful_day_s.html">I wrote</a> back in 2003, shortly before moving to Philadelphia, I used to welcome each amazingly beautiful day that occurred between May and November in the Bay Area (and those beautiful days occurred, well, DAILY) with an exclamation of "it's another beautiful day in California!" as I pulled back the curtains in the morning. Believe it or not, I've had reason lately to do that here.
</p>
<p>
Philadelphia has experienced a positively <em>glorious</em> spring, a spring that every Bay Area friend and colleague would openly envy as they slogged through months of cold, driving rain. While spring has come late to San Francisco (it's just arriving now, a few short days before the start of summer), Philadelphia has been offering us crisp upper 60s and low 70s with little humidity and refreshing breezes day after day. OK, we've had a few bouts of heat and humidity&#8212;with more to come this weekend&#8212;but even an extra-warm, 87-degree day like today was made incredibly pleasant by a cooling breeze and fairly low humidity.
</p>

<p>
In short, for the past two-to-three months or so, we've been experiencing San Francisco weather&#8212;the kind of weather I've been pining for ever since we moved out here&#8212;while San Francisco's been getting shafted with storms. I'm not saying I don't still wish we could move back there sometimes (more on that in another post that I've been mulling over for a while but have yet to actually write), but for the moment I'm thrilled to be able to walk around the semi-quiet, semi-clean, mostly-hill-free city streets every morning and exclaim, "it's another beautiful day in Philadelphia!"

<p>We just got back from SF, and the weather was perfect.  No fog, no rain, just sun and warmth and breezes.</p>

<p>But oh, the hills!  They made me long for flat old Philadelphia.</p>

<p>I'd heard that spring had finally sprung in SF. (I get the weather report from the people I have phone meetings with there 3x a week. :) So glad you got to experience the area at its best!</p>
