Right as I was clicking the Save button on the Time Out post last night, Austen said the magic word. I went in and got him, and we sat together in the chair for a few minutes talking about what happened. I wanted to make sure he understood the reason for the time out, though who knows what actually sunk in on that front.
</p>
<p>
He'd been unsuccessful at vomiting, try as he might, but he'd filled his diaper with the biggest poop I've ever seen, so I took him downstairs, changed him, and then put him in his high chair for dinner. He melted down twice in the space of 5 minutes&#8212;once when I went to wash my hands after the diaper change, and again when I strapped him into the chair. I ended up getting him out when he wouldn't stop screaming and refused to eat, and we sat together for a little while on the stairs. Finally, he leaned in for not one, not two, but 6 "sorry" kisses in a row. There was a little murmuring back and forth about being nice and showing love, and then we moved back to the dining room. He ate a full dinner of watermelon, corn, and Trader Joe's asparagus-asiago cheese chicken sausage while sitting on my lap.
</p>

<p>
After dinner we had an uneventful bathtime, followed by the usual Sesame Street->kiss Daddy->go up to bed routine. He requested songs with "ummmm...", but he vetoed every one I tried, even the old standards, and conked out after about 5 minutes. He slept soundly until almost 7am, and gave me my usual morning snuggle. Hopefully we've reset now, and there will be no more hitting tonight.
