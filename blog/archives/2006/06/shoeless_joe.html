<h3 class="title">Shoeless Joe</h3>

<p>
Jess (the nanny who's watching Austen this week while Hannah's away) called yesterday afternoon with some bad news: apparently Austen had thrown a shoe overboard while they were walking back from Seeger playground, and she didn't notice until she pulled him out of the stroller near Fitler Square. It's not surprising that she didn't notice; I usually don't unless I hear the clunk of his sippy cup hitting the ground or I trip over whatever it is he's dropped, assuming he drops it directly in front of him. We've lost at least two hats and a couple toys over the side in the past year or so, and Austen knows how to get his shoes and socks off himself now, so they were the next logical thing to go.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the wisdom of buying two pairs of shoes in the same size when they were on sale for 2 pairs/$50 is clear to me.

<p>We double knot Alexander's little boots ($45 for the pair) for just that reason.  They are actually hard for us to remove once we get home, but at least I know they won't go missing en route.</p>

<p>But his summer beach sneaks have just one stip of velcro, and he needs barely any effort to kick them off.  I am certain we'll lose one sooner or later.</p>

<p>However, at $7 a pair, I don't care.</p>

<p>We double knotted Austen's NBs, too, though fingernails were required to do it -- on the list of things to buy were 31-32" navy laces, since the 30" ones that came with the shoes weren't long enough. Even with double knots, though, Austen could usually pull the sneakers off.</p>

<p>Kids Foot Locker at Cherry Hill was out of the NBs in his size, so we got him the pair of Pumas that I'd wanted him to try on last time. (He cried so when we put the NBs on that when we discovered that they fit and looked cute, we didn't want to push our luck by trying on a different pair of sneaks.) I'm going to look for another pair of NBs on eBay for backup.<br />
