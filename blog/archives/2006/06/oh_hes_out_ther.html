<h3 class="title">Oh, He's Out There, Alright</h3>

<p>
Representative Ralph Regula (R, Ohio), quoted in a <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/06/08/gop_takes_aim_at_pbs_funding/?page=1">Boston Globe</a> article about proposed cuts to Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding, regarding PBS and NPR supporters:
</p>
<blockquote>
"They've got a bigger megaphone than I do," he said. "They'll trot out Elmo and Mickey Mouse and Lord knows who else, and I'll be out there kind of by myself."
</blockquote>

<p>
What we'll be trotting out is certainly not Mickey Mouse (who's a registered trademark, I believe, among other things, of the Walt Disney Company), but the programming we depend upon&#8212;and support with both our tax dollars and regular donations&#8212;such as <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3">Morning Edition</a>, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/">NewsHour</a>, <a href="http://pbskids.org/lions/">Between the Lions</a>, and yes, <a href="http://pbskids.org/sesame/">the show that my son refers to as "Elmo"</a>. 
</p>

<p>
You can have your tax cut back&#8212;really! I never asked for one anyway&#8212;if it means we can't pay for Sesame Street. Somehow, however, I don't think that's the case. It's hard to believe that CPB is the reason for our huge federal deficits, and that it's really a choice between "giving a little more money to handicapped children versus providing appropriations for public broadcasting." It's about not even making a drop in the bucket when it comes to reducing the size of government while taking out what you perceive to be a bastion of liberal bias. Dorkwad.
