<h3 class="title">Cherry Bomb</h3>

<p>
I have a very strong craving for a Manhattan right now. Which is weird, because I've never had a Manhattan before. I can taste one in my memory so clearly, though.
</p>

<p>
 I suspect what I'm remembering is eating the cherries out of my dad's Manhattans when I was little. They tasted better than regular maraschino cherries (which I also loved), so I'd always beg my dad for his when we'd go out to dinner and he'd have a cocktail. I can't remember how old I was (7? 8? I remember the table we were sitting at, but not the restaurant or the occasion) when my mom caught on that I was enjoying the taste of the alcohol as much as the cherry, but when she did, she cut me off. I don't think I've had a Manhattan-soaked cherry since. And yet the memory&#8212;and the craving&#8212;lingers.
</p>

<p>
The craving is even odder when I consider that I don't really *have* cravings anymore. My close friends will be shocked to hear me say this&#8212;most know me as the Craving Queen&#8212;but since I gave up sugar in April (or rather, since I got used to not eating sugar, which was a couple weeks *after* I gave it up), I'm not only more even-keeled in general, but I'm also no longer ruled by my cravings. I can walk into a Metropolitan Bakery now and buy only the Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread. I feel no emotional attachment to the chocolate cream cheese brownies or the Metro cookies. I vaguely remember enjoying cupcakes at Starbucks, but I don't salivate when I see them (or any other baked good) in the case. Instead, I find myself inspecting the sandwiches.
</p>

<p>
It's a weird sensation, to be craving-free most of the time. I did notice that when I was under extreme work stress a couple weeks ago that my mind turned to thoughts of an incredibly dark, dense chocolate cake (though I wanted the chocolateyness more than the sweetness). Once the stress passed, the chocolate craving did, too. I've also noticed that if I eat popcorn, I'm more likely to want sweets the next day. I can't for the life of me imagine what brought on cravings for sweet vermouth, bourbon, and angastora bitters, though. Perhaps it was that I was just looking at photos of Austen and my parents, and it reminded me of when I was a child? Perhaps I am empathizing with my mom because I want to cut Austen off from sipping my decaf lattes before he forms a Starbucks habit? I'm not sure.
</p>

<p>
In any case, the bourbon-and-bitters craving is waning now, and I've no use for a maraschino cherry. A little snuggle from my kid, however, would totally hit the spot.
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Hug That Didn't Happen</h3>

<p>
We're visiting family this weekend; we drove here from Philly, and another part of the family drove from farther away. With our shorter drive and our earlier departure time, we arrived first, of course. When the rest of the family arrived a few hours later, Austen, who'd already been having a great time playing with the older relatives, was thrilled to see a playmate his size&#8212;his almost 4 year-old cousin, whom I'll call C&#8212;come through the door.
</p>  

<p>
Al and I were sitting on the bottom steps of the staircase, which starts its climb in the foyer, as C and his dad came in. Austen stood in the foyer and waited patiently while C removed his shoes, and as C entered Austen's orbit, Austen went in for the hug. He threw his arms open wide and leaned into C, who didn't respond in any way. He stayed half-turned away from Austen while Austen attempted the hug, and then he dashed back to the door. Austen lurched forward a bit, turned to follow C's path with his eyes, and scowled in obvious hurt and confusion. That's when I started to cry.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't a sobbing kind of cry; it was more a lump-in-the-throat-with-watery-eyes kind of cry, so Austen didn't seem to notice the tears when I scooped him up a few seconds later. I carried him into the kitchen, gave him a big hug, told him I loved him, and then kissed him and sent him back out to the foyer to attempt another greeting. Then Al had to hug *me* for a few seconds while I tried to get it together to go out and say hello to the rest of the clan.
</p>

<p>
To his credit and my pride, Austen didn't even glance in my and Al's direction when his hug was rebuffed, which I hope means that the indicident didn't immediately burn itself on his heart the way his scowl did on mine. I suspect for him it's just one of many experiences he's going to have as he develops and hones his social skills, and one he didn't take to heart. It certainly didn't stop him from trying to play with C (who finally acknowledged Austen's presence with a "stop touching my toy!" growl), or from trying to copy him (when C got a Yo Baby yogurt from the fridge and sat at the table to eat it, Austen did the same).
</p>

<p>
I firmly believe my job as a mother is to raise an independent child (who will become an indepdent adult), one who's equipped to handle any situation. I know it was probably smotherly rather than motherly to swoop in and snuggle Austen after the failed hug attempt, and I'm sure a better mother would have let him sort out what to do next on his own, but I couldn't do it. My heart broke a little in that moment, and I think I needed that snuggle more than Austen did.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Windfall</h3>

<p>
My mother-in-law was kind enough to give each of her daughters-in-law a bit of walking around money this weekend, and I've been trying to decide what to do with it. I need to decide soon, before the extra cash burns a hole in my pocket and encourages me to blow it all on extra decaf short lattes at Starbucks.
</p>

<p>
Al has suggested that I use the money to buy a new lens for my Canon 10D (something I've been talking about almost incessantly); I think the only reason I didn't think of this myself is that the lens I *really* want costs way more than I have to spend.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=avocado8&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00009R6WT%2F" class="noborder"><img src="/blog/images/28-70f2.8L.png" alt="24mm-70mm/f2.8L" width="154" height="104" style="border:0"/></a></p>

<p>
I'm considering two other options in lieu of my dream lens: A Speedlite flash and a less expensive lens. 
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=avocado8&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0002XQWCK%2F" class="noborder"><img style="margin-right:20px;border:0" src="/blog/images/speedlite580x.png" alt="speedlite 580x" width="115" height="150" /></a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=avocado8&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00006I53S%2F" class="noborder"><img style="margin-bottom:21px;border:0" src="/blog/images/28-135mmf3.5-5.6IS.png" alt="28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM" width="154" height="108" /></a>
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, I know I could get better photos with my current 50mm lens and the Speedlite because I'm often shooting Austen indoors, in low light conditions (or outdoors with harsh shadows, where a fill flash would help). On the other hand, I'm not really a giant fan of flash photography .This aversion is probably partly due to the practically-useless built-in flash on the Canon 10D, though even when I had a decent external flash for my Minolta x700, I preferred existing-light shots. Which brings me to the other dilemma: If I go with the less-expensive lens instead of the Speedlite, I'm giving up speed. (IOW, I won't be able to shoot lower than f/3.5&#8212;and sometimes f/5.6&#8212;which is necessary in low-light conditions.) What I'd hopefully get in return is  a closer focusing range and a wider angle, which would allow for better shots of Austen when we're playing in tight quarters (not to mention other, non-Austen shots where backing up is just not an option). The question is, am I giving up so much speed that the wider angle won't help any? That is, if I'm buying the lens so that I can get wide-angle shots of Austen indoors, am I also going to need the flash? If that's the case, maybe I'd better just put the windfall money in my savings account and hold out for the dream lens.
</p>

<p>
Any suggestions? Also, does anyone know of a camera store in the Philadelphia area that rents lenses (the way <a href="http://www.kspphoto.com/activepages/rental.html" target="a8_win">Keeble &amp; Shuchat</a>, where I bought my 10D and current lenses, does)?

<h3 class="title">Shoeless Joe</h3>

<p>
Jess (the nanny who's watching Austen this week while Hannah's away) called yesterday afternoon with some bad news: apparently Austen had thrown a shoe overboard while they were walking back from Seeger playground, and she didn't notice until she pulled him out of the stroller near Fitler Square. It's not surprising that she didn't notice; I usually don't unless I hear the clunk of his sippy cup hitting the ground or I trip over whatever it is he's dropped, assuming he drops it directly in front of him. We've lost at least two hats and a couple toys over the side in the past year or so, and Austen knows how to get his shoes and socks off himself now, so they were the next logical thing to go.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the wisdom of buying two pairs of shoes in the same size when they were on sale for 2 pairs/$50 is clear to me.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Swag</h3>

<p>
I made <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/avocado8.32230526">these bibs</a> on CafePress a long time ago, but every time I tried to order one, they were backordered. They're in stock now, so get 'em while they're hot! (Full disclosure: They're cotton and do not have a plastic backing, so for this cantaloupe-eating session I put a cheaper&#8212and shorter&#8212;plastic-backed bib underneath the <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/avocado8.32230526"><strong>blog fodder</strong></a> one. This bib would definitely be the one I'd choose for meals that involve avocados, chocolate chips, or anything else non-drippy that Austen tends to smear on his clothes, however. It's extra-long and provides great coverage.)

<h3 class="title">Oh, He's Out There, Alright</h3>

<p>
Representative Ralph Regula (R, Ohio), quoted in a <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/06/08/gop_takes_aim_at_pbs_funding/?page=1">Boston Globe</a> article about proposed cuts to Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding, regarding PBS and NPR supporters:
</p>

<blockquote>
"They've got a bigger megaphone than I do," he said. "They'll trot out Elmo and Mickey Mouse and Lord knows who else, and I'll be out there kind of by myself."
</blockquote>

<p>
What we'll be trotting out is certainly not Mickey Mouse (who's a registered trademark, I believe, among other things, of the Walt Disney Company), but the programming we depend upon&#8212;and support with both our tax dollars and regular donations&#8212;such as <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3">Morning Edition</a>, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/">NewsHour</a>, <a href="http://pbskids.org/lions/">Between the Lions</a>, and yes, <a href="http://pbskids.org/sesame/">the show that my son refers to as "Elmo"</a>. 
</p>

<p>
You can have your tax cut back&#8212;really! I never asked for one anyway&#8212;if it means we can't pay for Sesame Street. Somehow, however, I don't think that's the case. It's hard to believe that CPB is the reason for our huge federal deficits, and that it's really a choice between "giving a little more money to handicapped children versus providing appropriations for public broadcasting." It's about not even making a drop in the bucket when it comes to reducing the size of government while taking out what you perceive to be a bastion of liberal bias. Dorkwad.

<h3 class="title">Recent Developments</h3>

<p>
There's a lot going on in Austen's world, and I haven't written much about him in the past week, so I have some catching up to do. First, a recap of our two weeks with Jess and Mira. Overall, the experience was outstanding&#8212;about as good as you could hope for when your regular and beloved nanny goes on vacation. Al and I made a quick list of the pros and cons of the arrangement last night, and here's what we came up with:
</p>


<div class="tableCols">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Pros</th>
<th>Cons</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Jess</strong><br />
Jess is a great nanny: calm, soothing, sweet, and sensible. Never had a moment's worry leaving Austen in her care. </td>
<td><strong>Handoff</strong><br />
Having to take Austen over to Mira's house in the morning and having him make a grand entrance via our garage at 5:45pm cut into my work time a bit, but it wasn't too bad. The extra walk in the morning was nice, and it meant I could stop at Trader Joe's on the way back if I needed anything. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Mira</strong><br />
Austen and Mira play together regularly&#8212;maybe a couple times a week&#8212;but they both seemed to love hanging out together all day, every day. Jess said they really played <em>together</em>, and they looked out for each other on the playground. </td>
<td><strong>Cats</strong><br />
Ever since Annie died, I haven't been around cats much&#8212;which means my tolerance to cat dander went way down. Dropping Austen off at a house with two cats guaranteed me an asthma attack, itchy, swollen eyes, or both twice a day (he'd come home covered in cat hair). </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Diaper pail</strong><br />
This is one of Al's pros, since he's responsible for emptying the diaper pail&#8212;and it's something he had to do less often because Austen wasn't here for at least one or two diaper changes per day.  </td>
<td><strong>Lunch</strong><br />
Hannah feeds Austen lunch 14 days out of 15 (once in a while I come down and fix something for all of us, or order a pizza), so it was a new thing to try to come up with a portable lunch for Austen every morning. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Cleaner kitchen</strong><br />
Another one from Al (he cleans up the kitchen at night, too). Because Austen and Hannah weren't here to eat and drink, there were fewer dishes to do. </td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Paul and Tracy</strong><br />
Mira's parents are similar in age to me and Al, and they also have similar work routines (he works up on the third floor of their townhouse, as I do, and she walks to work, as Al does). They're also enthusiastic, super nice, and most importantly, totally behind the idea of sharing Jess (and their house) with us. The only strike against them is that they're Yankee fans. (Can you believe it???) </td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>
 I suspect I'll get the same late start at work on Monday even though Hannah comes at 8am, since I'll want to hear about all her adventures in Thailand, Hong Kong, and Bali over the past two weeks, and she'll want to hear about all the new stuff Austen's doing. Which brings me to my next topic....
</p>
<p>
Where to start here? Maybe with Austen learning to open doors with knobs on Wednesday evening. Shortly after Jess dropped him off with me upstairs, Austen dashed into his room, slammed the door, and then after a few rattlings of the knob, opened it himself. He was so freaking proud of himself that he ran out to my desk and babbled something like, &quot;let's do that again!&quot; We played knock-and-open&#8212;with Austen doing the opening&#8212;until Al came home from work about 10 minutes later.
</p>
<p>
The next day when Jess dropped him off, she said, &quot;did you know Austen can open doors?&quot; Me: &quot;Oh yeah, he learned that last night.&quot; Jess: &quot;Oh, because he opened the front door at Mira's house today.&quot; He'd never done that before, and Jess didn't know it was a possibility, so it startled her. Luckily, she caught him before he (or one of the cats) could escape. I actually suspect he'd been practicing on the front door knob at Mira's house, which is an old, old townhouse. The knob on the front door is lower than on modern doors and easier for Austen to grab.
</p>
<p>
I'm thinking he's also learning by watching; he's really interested in what we're doing and how. He also surprised the heck out of me when we were watching Sesame Street last night: The segment where Ernie teaches Bert how to pat his head and rub his tummy while singing came on, and Ernie said, &quot;can YOU pat your head and rub your tummy?&quot; I thought, &quot;oh, that must be for older kids.&quot; I was busy puzzling out what age group Ernie was talking to &#8212;3? 4?&#8212;when Austen started to pat his head. He turned and grinned at me with a look that said, &quot;hey look! I'm doing it!&quot; and then turned back to Ernie for further instructions.  The kid's a total sponge.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday Austen started saying Mo<em>M</em>, with an emphasis on the second M, as if to let me know that he knows that there are two Ms in Mom. Before yesterday he called me Ma (or, once in a while, Mama). He said Mo<em>M</em>, Mo<em>M</em>, Mo<em>M</em> over and over last night. So charming. 
</p>
<p>
Less charming was the off-and-on screaming at 12:40am and 5am, which is pretty unusual for him.  We assume it's due to teething, because he's got teeth coming in all over the place. Four molars have come up in the past month, and it looks like a bunch more bottom teeth are coming in now. Anyway, because he didn't go back to sleep&#8212;or even want to snuggle&#8212;after the 5am crying jag, both Al and I were exhausted this morning. After Al took him downstairs at about 5:30, I slept until 7 and then got up for my walk. Instead of going out by myself, though, I took Austen so that Al could get some sleep. 
</p>
<p>
It wasn't as bad  as I thought it would be to take Austen with me; I finally got around to washing the Zooper seat, and that stroller works surprisingly well as a walking/jogging stroller when the front wheels are locked. Austen was pretty chilled out for most of the ride, too, which meant I still got my quiet time&#8212;except when I ran across Spring Garden Street, and he got addicted to the speed. After that I had to run a lot more than walk. :) Luckily, Starbucks wasn't far away, and I was able to distract him by stopping in for a Horizon Vanilla Milk box. After that, I was allowed to walk. And when he finished with his milk, I got <em>my</em> treat&#8212;he handed me the milk box and said, &quot;thank you, Mama.&quot; Can you blame me for crying? 
</p>

<p>
And finally, Al and I realized today that we're no longer having "you take him! no, YOU take him!" arguments on the weekends. Instead, we're arguing over who <em>gets</em> him. Austen is so much fun to be around now, and so self-sufficient, that we find that we can get things done *and* have family time (usually at the same time, though sometimes we just screw the chores and play, play play). Plus, with both of us working, and especially with Austen being at Mira's house during the day for the past two weeks, we really value the time we have together. I know I've told Austen several times in the past week how glad I am that Daddy talked me into having him.

<h3 class="title">Old</h3>

<p>
I don't feel old. I'm 37 and a half, but I feel like I'm still in my late twenties, and I'm told I don't look older than 30. Every now and then, however, just how long I've actually been alive and <em>doing things</em> hits me. Like this morning, when I was searching for a t-shirt to wear on my morning walk, and I hit on my bright pink Rugby Ball shirt... from 1989.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/167088087/" title="Photo Sharing" class="special"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/69/167088087_28134af7ac_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="uga rugby ball 1989" /></a>
</p>

<p>
This is probably the only shirt I still have from college&#8212;it's held up *really* well, far better than <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2003/07/georgia_on_my_m.html">the other UGA rugby shirts</a> I talked about back in 2003&#8212;but I hadn't thought about how long ago college was until I was actually out walking. I tried to do the math: How many years ago was 1989? I kept coming up with 17, and that didn't seem right. Was I really old enough to have almost-adult memories from 17 years ago? No, definitely couldn't be right.
</p>

<p>
I did the math a few different ways ("let's see, 1996 was 10 years ago, and 1989 was seven years before that, so... hm, 17 again"), and then I considered my age. If I'm 37 now, how old would I have been in 1989? Yep, 20. College-age. Somehow, 20 just doesn't seem that long ago, and yet...when I was in college, the Web hadn't been invented yet. No one used cell phones. Only supergeeks used e-mail. I didn't work out or play sports. I was an English major who looked at people like they were crazy when they asked, "so, are you going to teach?", but who didn't have any other career ideas. I didn't want kids, and was ambivalent about marriage (the latter continued to be the case until a few months into my relationship with Al, and the former was true until about a year into our marriage).

<p>
It just seems odd now to be able to talk in terms of decades (or even scores!), to think that I was making decisions for myself, that I was running my own life, twenty years ago. Does this mean I am finally a grownup?

<h3 class="title">It's Another Beautiful Day in Philadelphia</h3>

<p>
As <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/archives/2003/09/beautiful_day_s.html">I wrote</a> back in 2003, shortly before moving to Philadelphia, I used to welcome each amazingly beautiful day that occurred between May and November in the Bay Area (and those beautiful days occurred, well, DAILY) with an exclamation of "it's another beautiful day in California!" as I pulled back the curtains in the morning. Believe it or not, I've had reason lately to do that here.
</p>

<p>
Philadelphia has experienced a positively <em>glorious</em> spring, a spring that every Bay Area friend and colleague would openly envy as they slogged through months of cold, driving rain. While spring has come late to San Francisco (it's just arriving now, a few short days before the start of summer), Philadelphia has been offering us crisp upper 60s and low 70s with little humidity and refreshing breezes day after day. OK, we've had a few bouts of heat and humidity&#8212;with more to come this weekend&#8212;but even an extra-warm, 87-degree day like today was made incredibly pleasant by a cooling breeze and fairly low humidity.
</p>

<p>
In short, for the past two-to-three months or so, we've been experiencing San Francisco weather&#8212;the kind of weather I've been pining for ever since we moved out here&#8212;while San Francisco's been getting shafted with storms. I'm not saying I don't still wish we could move back there sometimes (more on that in another post that I've been mulling over for a while but have yet to actually write), but for the moment I'm thrilled to be able to walk around the semi-quiet, semi-clean, mostly-hill-free city streets every morning and exclaim, "it's another beautiful day in Philadelphia!"

<h3 class="title">Eating Out</h3>

<p>
This morning Al and I had brunch at <a href="http://www.cafelift.com/" target="a8_win">Cafe Lift</a> for the second Saturday in a row. Al had stopped in for lunch there after a meeting in the warehouse district a couple weeks ago, and he fell in love. It reminded him of the kind of place that's common in South Park, San Francisco&#8212;in other words, an industrial, arty, high-ceilinged-yet-homey space where you can get upscale salads and panini&#8212;but much rarer  in Philadelphia. 
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/169165333/" title="Photo Sharing" class="special"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/72/169165333_50796f6ecf_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="@ cafe lift with sleeping boopster" /></a>
</p>

<p>
While I like the space a lot&#8212;it's roomy without feeling cavernous; has nice lighting, big windows with sheer, billowy curtains, and a variety of seating options; and offers artists wall space from which to display and sell their works&#8212;I'm still not completely sold on the food. The <a href="http://www.cafelift.com/menus/menu_brunch.php">brunch menu</a> has many options for a fishitarian like me, including several meat-free fritatas, salads, sandwiches, and specials, but I've yet to hit on something I can say I really enjoy.
</p>

<p>
The first time we went I was jonesing for protein, so I ordered the smoked salmon fritata. First problem: it was more like a souffl&eacute; or a french toast than the denser-than-a-quiche dish I think of when I think 'fritata'. Second problem: SALT. Oh my, was the smoked salmon salty, and the capers only made things worse. (Normally I'm a giant caper fan, especially with lox.) I'd thought that ricotta was a strange topper when I saw it listed on the menu&#8212;sour cream or cream cheese would have been more expected&#8212;but it turned out to be the one part of the dish I liked. I ended up scraping it off and eating it on the panino bread that was served as a side.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't stomach the fritata, but I did eat the potatoes that came with it. They were sort of a homefries version of the garlic fries we used to get at PacBell (now SBC) Park in San Francisco, only (of course) saltier. Aside from the extreme saltiness, they were pretty tasty. (I suspect the amount of salt is tuned to the Philadelphia palate, which is particularly desensitized to the stuff.) Another plus was Al's choice, the daily special salad of mixed greens, grilled shrimp, cranberries, goat cheese, and pine nuts in a balsamic dressing. I'd actually considered ordering the salad myself, but the NO SUBSTITUTIONS sign scared me off (I'm allergic to pine nuts). As it turned out, the waiter agreed, after a short pause and a glance at the specials board, to hold the pine nuts at Al's request. Because Al was willing to share, I didn't go entirely without protein at this meal.
</p>

<p>
This morning I decided I'd go with salad, since Al's had been a success. The shrimp and goat cheese was no longer on the board, so I got a Ni&ccedil;oise... even though the lack of potatoes, haricots verts, and even <em>ni&ccedil;oise olives</em> in the description gave me pause. (The salad was served with roasted red peppers&#8212;of which I'm not a giant fan&#8212;the ubiquitous capers, and gaeta olives instead.) The seared tuna and boiled eggs over mixed greens sounded nice, however, so the Ni&ccedil;oise got the nod over the spinach salad, which offered only gorgonzola and pistachios for protein. I ordered a side of the garlic homefries with the hope that they'd make up for the missing boiled new potatoes in the salad.
</p>

<p>
The mixed greens with balsamic part of the salad was very nice&#8212;just like the salad Al had last Saturday. The peppers, capers, and olives, luckily, were arranged around the outside of the plate, making them easy to avoid. The tuna wasn't what I'd pictured when I read "seared", though I may be the only customer who expected rare to medium-rare slices rather than a grilled slab of well-done fish. It was seasoned well (if a tad on the salty side), however, so I have no other complaints there. The eggs were poached rather than boiled (and therefore hot rather than cold); the yolks were runny enough that I ended up eating them on the panino bread that accompanied the meal (and which I otherwise would have left untouched).
</p>

<p>
The potatoes were, again, extremely salty, which suggests that this is their normal  state. I wish Lift would let diners salt to taste, as the potatoes are otherwise very good, and the side portion is large enough for two people to share. I shared them with Al, of course, who had the Grilled Chicken Panino (a repeat of the lunch that had captured his imagination). Three good meals on his part means, I suspect, that he'll suggest we go there again. Luckily, there are still a couple things on the menu that I'd be willing to try before I give up entirely. After all, the space is nice...

<h3 class="title">While We Were Sleeping</h3>

<p>
I got up with Austen this morning to give Al a chance to sleep in, so even though I'm not usually a napper, I felt the need to conk out while watching the U.S. Open on TV this afternoon. We were all watching in the living room (or rather, Al and I were watching, and Austen was alternately sitting with us on the couch and running around the room playing with various toys), so I announced my intentions, put my head in Al's lap, and was out cold until Austen felt the need to pinch my nostrils closed about 45 minutes later.
</p>

<p>
When I sat up, I immediately noticed that the storage dresser in the corner looked a little different:
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="dresser_full.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/dresser_full.jpg" width="320" height="480" /><br />
<img alt="dresser_closeup.jpg" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/dresser_closeup.jpg" width="480" height="320" />
</p>

<p>
Me: "Did you let Austen draw all over the dresser?"<br />
Al: "Oh, he must have done that when I was asleep."<br />
Me: "You were asleep, too?" I start scanning the room to see what else Austen might have done while both of his parents were out cold. Suddenly the nose pinch  makes sense; he was probably just checking to make sure I was still alive.<br />
Al: "Uh, yeah. He woke me up by trying to hand me the blue crayon. He was chewing, so my first thought was that he'd eaten part of the crayon, but his teeth weren't blue."<br />
Me: "What *was* he chewing?"<br />
Al: "Beats me."
</p>

<p>
Needless to say, Austen and I had a little talk about suitable drawing surfaces a few minutes later, though I think he knew that the dresser was off limits before he started scribbling. If he's not announcing that he's about to do something bad by saying "nooooooo" immediately before doing it, he's confessing the evil deed immediately after (hence the proffer of the blue crayon). Thank goodness for melamine and Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.
</p>

<p>
Happy Father's Day, everybody!
</p>

<h3 class="title">No More Homework</h3>

<p>
My mom didn't believe in homework. If I ever probed beyond this simple declaration to discover the reasons behind her belief, I don't remember it specifically, but I do seem to recall that she felt that reading and undirected play were hugely important.
</p>

<p>
Of course, as with so many of my mom's declarations, I took it as gospel&#8212;and license not to work very hard. I know that despite her disagreement with common educational practice, my mom did still inquire as to whether I had any homework; since I didn't like carrying books home from school, "don't you have any homework?" was actually a pretty common query, to which I always answered, "I did it at school." (Once in a while this was even true.) 
</p>

<p>
Unlike so many of my mom's declarations, I kept "I don't believe in homework" as my own. We are more unalike than similar now that we are both adults and mothers, but I think we're in agreement that homework is a soul killer, a stealer of childhood, and usually a waste of time. It is with great dismay that I've read over the years about the increasing homework burden on children as young as 5. I've seen with my own eyes second and third graders struggling home under the weight of a backpack bursting at the seams with books. It's just wrong for elementary school children to have back and shoulder pain&#8212;not to mention anxiety and depression&#8212;because we as parents want them to be able to compete in a global market. If that's what it takes, count me out. (Perhaps one of the reasons I've considered home schooling Austen is becoming clear, eh?)
</p>

<p>
Now I read that piling on the homework may *not* be what it takes. In an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/19/opinion/19bennett.html">op-ed piece in the New York Times</a> (free subscription required to view) this morning, co-authors of the forthcoming book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307340171/avocado8/">The Case Against Homework: How Homework Is Hurting Our Children and What We Can Do About It</a> write:
</p>

<blockquote>
In fact, there's serious doubt about whether homework has any benefit at all. Most studies have found little or no correlation between homework and achievement (meaning grades and test scores) in elementary school or middle school. According to Harris Cooper of Duke University, the nation's leading researcher on the subject, there is a clear correlation amoung high school students, but he warns that "overloading them with homework is not associated with higher grades."
</blockquote>

<p>
For the record, I did just fine without doing my homework. My grades suffered a bit when homework counted for a significant portion of the grade, of course, but I don't feel like my learning suffered. In fact, I think all that time *not* doing homework probably helped me, not least because I spent a good deal of it reading, writing letters and journals, and daydreaming. I'm all for reinforcing concepts, but I've found throughout my life&#8212;in school and especially beyond&#8212;that sometimes walking away from a problem is the best way to understand it (and, often, to come up with a solution for it). Let's give kids that same time to mull things over... and, more importantly, to just be kids.

<h3 class="title">Two Blue Shoes</h3>

<p>
Al asked me yesterday morning, "have you written in your blog that Austen picks his shoes out now?", which made me smile. Al has never really understood the desire (or need) to blog, though for the most part he's very supportive of mine. Over the past 12-18 months, however, he's started to see this site as an important record, if not of my growth and development, at least of Austen's.
</p>

<p>
Which brings me to the shoes. I think I mentioned that Austen seemed to understand the concept of "two", having once pointed out two buses to me with "two!" instead of his usual "ba!" I often say to him, "one shoe, two shoes. Two blue shoes," so now he knows to answer the question, "how many shoes are you holding?" with "two" (when he's holding both of them, of course). He also knows that the New Balance sneakers are blue, whereas the Pumas are black. Personally, I prefer the Pumas, but ever since we managed to find another pair of the NBs on sale, he's wanted to wear those almost every day.
</p>

<p>
Austen started picking out his shoes last month. He'd bring me his fish sandals when he wanted to wear those, and sneakers (and socks!) when he wanted something with a little more oomph. The NBs are definitely his favorite shoes now, though; if we try to hide them so we can impose a little variety, he searches for them and then screams "oh YEAH!" like a tiny little Kool-Aid man when he spots them. At that point, it's the NBs or nothing.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of the blue NBs, Austen accidentally peed on them last night. We'd undressed him in preparation for bath time, and he was sitting on the stepstool in front of the sink, holding the shoes, when he started to pee. We said, "oh no no no, honey, don't pee on your shoes!" and rescued them from him. He seemed to take this (correctly) as an indication that he should stop peeing, period, so he did.
</p>

<p>
Al remarked when I was finished wiping down the shoes that Austen still looked like he needed to pee, so we stood him on the stepstool in front of the toilet and told him to have at it. He seemed intimidated, however, so I just plopped him into the tub, kissed Al goodbye (he had a hockey game), and started bathtime.
</p>

<p>
Austen was poking his p____ a bit, so I said, "do you have to pee, sweetie?" Austen: "Yeah." Me: "It's OK, you can pee in the tub." At which point he bent his knees a bit, stared down at his p____, and visibly concentrated until he produced a stream. I said, "yay, you're peeing!," and he smiled at me briefly before returning his attention to his p____. It may sound like nothing, but I'm pretty proud of him. I think this is the first time he's ever peed on command (and obviously stopped on command as well, a few minutes earlier), which means he's learning that he can control when he goes. I imagine that potty training will be a two steps forward, one step (or perhaps three steps) back affair, but at least we've taken our first step.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Craaaaap</h3>

<p>
The vision in my left eye is so kaleidescopic right now that it's difficult to see to type this, so don't be surprised if there are many typos. I'm going mostly by feel and what I can see out of my right eye. I'm having a crazy migraine&#8212;one that so far has produced not one but <em>two</em> bouts of blurry vision.
</p>

<p>
The usual progression of a migraine for me is:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Notice missing pixel or two in my forward field of vision.</li>
<li>Notice whole sections of scene missing.</li>
<li>Vision becomes kaleidescopic, mostly on one side. (Sometimes it seems as if it's on both sides, but it's almost always really on one.)</li>
<li>Kaleidescopic vision becomes so bad that it's dangerous to drive, especially if peripheral vision also goes on that same side (rarer). Can also be dangerous to walk, and it's definitely impossible to work (as I mentioned, I'm not seeing most of my computer screen right now).</li>
<li>Vision clears.</li>
<li>Ten to twenty minutes pass with no pain or vision problems.</li>
<li>Headache and/or neckache hits.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are some variations, of course; with the last four or five migraines, for example, the blurry vision stage went so quickly I never had time to wonder if it *was* a migraine, and the headache never got bad enough to impair my normal routine (or make me want to sleep it off). Once after a hit to the chin that spun my head around in a hockey game, I got a migraine that was completely in my neck and shoulders (no headache at all, but really back neck and shoulder pain, preceeded by the blurry vision). This morning's double blurry vision session, however, is a new one on me. I got the headache/neckache as scheduled after the first blurry vision episode (which progressed so slowly&#8212;and coincided with my morning walk, when I was already squinting into the morning sun&#8212;that I didn't realize that I'd lost whole sections of my vision until someone greeted me with "good morning" and scared the heck out of me because I hadn't seen him coming), and then 90 minutes after the first episode started, the second launched. The first session included a loss of peripheral vision on the left, as evidenced by the fact that I knocked over a display of cookies on the Starbucks counter with my left hand when I reached for my coffee. I didn't even know what I'd hit until one of the packaged cookies rolled to my right.
</p>

<p>
I'm wondering if drinking caffeinated coffee&#8212;which I only do when I'm having a migraine because normally caffeine *produces* a headache&#8212;caused the second bout of blurriness? Or maybe it's just extra-raging hormones (the usual culprits in the migraine saga)? Whatever it is, it's a little scary.
</p>

<p>
Hm, interesting. The kaleidescopy has stopped now, but I see that I've still got a dark spot that's difficult to see through on the left. If I can't work through it, I may have to go back to bed for a while...
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update, 10:17am </strong>~ Headache/neckache still present, shoulders now aching, too. Vision is better. Still fairly functional.

<h3 class="title">Dark Side and Dark Circles</h3>

<p>
I think I'd be worn out from yesterday's migraine anyway, even if I hadn't stayed up until almost midnight for the past two nights to watch a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/" target="a8_win">Frontline</a> on Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, George Tenet, and the way the intelligence communities (not to mention a Secretary of State) were used and abused between 9/11 and the runup to the invasion of Iraq. I did stay up to watch that documentary, however, and now I'm exhausted&#8212;and fascinated.
</p>

<p>
I'm one of the few among my friends and acquaintences to have strongly disliked (nay, hated) <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/" target="a8_win">Farenheight 9/11</a>. It wasn't the subject matter so much as the way the movie was strung together with hyperbole, innuendo, overwrought emotion, and, in many spots, what looked to my narrowed eyes like half-truths. I'm not as well-read as many on the inner workings of the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/books/index.html?title=Price%20of%20Loyalty:%20George%20W.%20Bush,%20the%20White%20House,%20and%20the%20Education%20of%20Paul%20O'Neill">Bush administration</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=avocado8&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0743260244%2F">war on terror</a>, but I have done <em>some</em> reading, and I would have preferred to see a documentary that spoke to my head rather than trying to inflame my heart.
</p>

<p>
Frontline's The Dark Side was just what I was looking for. From a <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2006/06/20/dark_side_sheds_light_on_cheney/" target="a8_win">Boston Globe review of the episode</a>, forwarded to me from Al this morning:
</p>

<blockquote>
To many, Cheney is the dark side of the Bush administration, and this program will only cement that judgment. "Frontline" chronicles the brutal campaign by two consummate political in-fighters -- Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld -- to decimate the CIA, politically emasculate Secretary of State Colin Powell, and construct a near-limitless concept of executive power during war. While many of these strands are familiar, they have not been assembled as effectively before on television to present a coherent picture of what happened after 9/11.
</blockquote>

<p>
I highly recommend both the full Globe review and the Frontline documentary, which will be available for viewing on the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/" target="a8_win">Frontline website</a> at 5pm today.

<p>
Hannah and Austen are down in the basement playroom watching the U.S. play Ghana in World Cup soccer. I keep hearing Hannah gasping, "oooh! oh! errrg!" and both of them yelling "yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!" I see the score at the moment is 2-1 Ghana; I'm hoping the U.S. can score at least one more so I can hear Austen shout "gooooaaaaaaal"!
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update: </strong>No goal. Ghana won. :(

<h3 class="title">Time Out</h3>

<p>
I am listening to Austen scream and wretch through his first real time out right now, waiting for the magic word. An hour ago, that word would have been "sorry". He pinched my neck, hard&#8212;something he knows not to do&#8212;when I told him he couldn't have a second cookie, and when he refused to let go, I pried his fingers off. That's when he hit me.
</p>

<p>
Over the next 10 minutes I got avoidance, and then the toddler equivalent of a teenage "I'm SOR-<em>RY!</em>" in the form of a hard poke to the shoulder and then the chin. That's when Al and I agreed that he needed the time out. I'd have preferred not to use his crib as the time out area, since I don't want him to associate the place he sleeps with being punished, but when it came down to it, I couldn't think of anywhere else to put him that would communicate how serious we were (and that would keep him from tearing things up and/or just playing).
</p>

<p>
I can tell you that it fucking sucks to sit here listening to him scream and wretch and moan nononono, but I'm not going in there until he either gets control of himself or says the magic word&#8212;the word that would indicate that it's not all about him and the injustice of being plopped into his crib fully clothed, without any dinner or cuddling or singing. It's a word, unlike "sorry", that I know he knows how to say clearly and with full understanding of its meaning. (He usually expresses "sorry" by kissing or hugging, rather than saying the word.)
</p>

<p>
I hope I'm not waiting out here all night, and that he doesn't lose his voice from all the screaming before he has a chance to say it. I also wonder if he knows that it's in his power to end the ordeal right now. Come on, buddy, you can do it. All you have to say is "mommy."

<h3 class="title">Resume Play</h3>

<p>
Right as I was clicking the Save button on the Time Out post last night, Austen said the magic word. I went in and got him, and we sat together in the chair for a few minutes talking about what happened. I wanted to make sure he understood the reason for the time out, though who knows what actually sunk in on that front.
</p>

<p>
He'd been unsuccessful at vomiting, try as he might, but he'd filled his diaper with the biggest poop I've ever seen, so I took him downstairs, changed him, and then put him in his high chair for dinner. He melted down twice in the space of 5 minutes&#8212;once when I went to wash my hands after the diaper change, and again when I strapped him into the chair. I ended up getting him out when he wouldn't stop screaming and refused to eat, and we sat together for a little while on the stairs. Finally, he leaned in for not one, not two, but 6 "sorry" kisses in a row. There was a little murmuring back and forth about being nice and showing love, and then we moved back to the dining room. He ate a full dinner of watermelon, corn, and Trader Joe's asparagus-asiago cheese chicken sausage while sitting on my lap.
</p>

<p>
After dinner we had an uneventful bathtime, followed by the usual Sesame Street->kiss Daddy->go up to bed routine. He requested songs with "ummmm...", but he vetoed every one I tried, even the old standards, and conked out after about 5 minutes. He slept soundly until almost 7am, and gave me my usual morning snuggle. Hopefully we've reset now, and there will be no more hitting tonight.

<h3 class="title">Caffeine Headache</h3>

<p>
I mentioned in <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/06/craaaaap.html">the post about the migraine</a> that usually caffeine causes headaches (though not usually migraines) for me. It's why I'm a dedicated decaf drinker, though I do worry that lately I've been getting more caffeine than usual given my now daily Starbucks runs. (Even decaf coffee has a little caffeine in it.)
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, on Sunday I failed to double-check with the barista that the double-tall latte he handed to me was, indeed, decaf, and I didn't realize it wasn't until I was 4/5 of the way through the drink that it wasn't. When the headache hit, suddenly the reason for the oddly strong taste became clear. (I'd thought it was just too little milk, or that they'd brewed the espresso at too high a temperature.)
</p>

<p>
At first it just seemed like a normal headache, but by the time we got into the car to drive home from Maryland, it had all the hallmarks of a migraine except the blurry vision. In fact, the head and neck pain were worse than I had with the migraine on Wednesday, and the nausea was intense. Or rather, I should say that the head and neck pain *are* worse than I had with the migraine on Wednesday, because they haven't gone away. Yep, I've had a headache/neckache for three days now, and neither seem to respond to Tylenol or Advil (again, like a migraine).
</p>

<p>
I'm going to get a massage tomorrow morning to see if that will help, and I'm off caffeine of all kinds now (including decaf coffee and tea, since those cause a pain spike). I hope that one double-tall latte didn't ruin coffee for me forever.

<h3 class="title">Wal-Mart</h3>

<p>
Scene: Paper goods aisle. A woman leans langorously on her cart, shuffling forward one... step... every... 30... seconds. I zip into the aisle from the opposite direction, scanning the packages of toilet paper for my favorite brand as I move toward the woman. I can't see the Ultra version I prefer, so I grab the regular version of the same brand.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Woman, pointing at the package in my hands with her chin: </strong>"How much is that?"<br />
<strong>Me, tilting sideways to look at the shelf tag: </strong>"Um, 6.97."<br />
<strong>Woman: </strong>How many sheets?<br />
<strong>Me, after scanning the package for this information: </strong>"362."<br />
<strong>Woman: </strong>"See? Doesn't have 1000 sheets."<br />
<strong>Me: </strong>"No, but it's soft."<br />
<strong>Woman: </strong>"Oh, it's soft, eh?"<br />
<strong>Me: </strong>"I'm a sucker for softness."

<h3 class="title">Update Coming</h3>

<p>
It hasn't escaped my notice that Austen turned 19 months old today. Hopefully I'll have time to write an update later tonight (but first I need to collect all the little notes I've left around the house about what he's been up to for the past month&#8212;the ones that say things like "fork" and "highchair" and "talkative"). There'll be a whole mess of photos, too.
