<h3 class="title">Guess What a Dinner of Watermelon and Prunes Gets You?</h3>

<p>
We mostly let Austen choose what he wants to eat*, and last night he chose a jar of Earth's Best prunes and oatmeal (stocked in case of constipation, which is a rare but painful occurance for Austen) and half a large tub of watermelon from Whole Foods. Lest you think we don't feed him proper, balanced meals, he also ate some popcorn and half a piece of shrimp.
</p>
<p>
It probably isn't difficult to guess what happened today. Well, you might not have guessed that I'm behind on the laundry and that Austen only had one clean pair of pants this morning, or that we ran out of wipes last night. But you can probably guess the rest. Poor Austen.

*we do deny him unlimited supplies of whipped cream.

<p>Lucy will eat watermelon all day long if we let her.  Prunes, on the other hand, she has had once, in baby-food form, before day care specifically requested that we not do that to them any more.  :)  </p>

<p>What does Austen eat for breakfast these days?  First thing in the morning, Lucy turns her nose up at anything that isn't a piece of American cheese.  I guess she just isn't hungry when she wakes up, but we feel like bad parents if we don't send her off to start her day with a full tummy.</p>

<p>Austen likes just about anything, but Al usually feeds him Bear Naked berry oatmeal, bananas, Cheerios or Zoe-Os and milk, two-egg omelets (usually just plain, no cheese, though he liked my cheese version the other night), or Yo Baby for breakfast. He'll also have watermelon, if it's available. :)</p>
