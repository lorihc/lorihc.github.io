<h3 class="title">What Happened to the 16 Month Update?</h3>

<p>
I realized last week that Austen turned 16 months on March 30, and I let the milestone blow by without an update. Every day since then that I've failed to produce an update I've regretted it more, because the developments of last month are quickly being overwhelmed by current cirumstances. I can no longer remember what happened for the first time in March; I only know for sure what's happening now.
</p>
<p>
I'm *pretty* sure that Austen started making the Oh My! face for the first time in his 16th month; I only have one photograph of it, and in it he's facing mostly away from me, but basically it's his version of the face I've been making at him since he was a tiny baby. Emoticonically, it'd be represented by <strong>:o</strong>, or <img src="/blog/images/o_icon.gif" alt="o face" width="24" height="24" class="noborder" style="vertical-align:middle" /> if you use Trillian. In lieu of photos of the Oh My! face, I present Sly Eye and Mischievous Look. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
There's a big milestone that I want to record but that I'm reluctant to mention here because (a) it might attract purient Googlers, and (b) it would totally embarrass Austen later in life (not that all this other stuff won't), even though it's totally normal. I hope that's enough information that when I re-read this two years from now I'll go, "oh, right!" rather than, "what the hell was I referring to there?"
</p>
<p>
Last month was definitely the one in which Austen got practically <em>proficient</em> at walking up and down stairs. He's always been a big fan of climbing stairs one foot at a time&#8212;since before he could walk&#8212;but of course back then we had to hold him up, and the feat required him to lean practically horizontal. A couple weeks ago I caught him <em>holding the railing</em> and <em>walking up the steps himself.</em> He still requires some assistance going down, but he's pretty sharp about the adjustments necessary to descend while holding a sippy cup in one hand vs. when that same hand is free to hold the railing.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure exactly when Austen decided he must become a Big Boy&#8212;was it prior to March 30, or just after?&#8212;but I'm hoping that this DIY fervor will eventually lead to toilet training before age two. Currently it's leading to occasional moments of triumph and delight (look at me sitting in a chair at the table ALL BY MYSELF! if I stand on my tippy toes I can reach the handles of the stroller and push it JUST LIKE MOMMY! this milk tastes even better drunk from a REAL GLASS! <span style="font-size:smaller">oops.</span>), and, more often, to moments of extreme frustration when he can't reach, manipulate, carry, or balance what he wants. He knows how to screw the cap on a bottle, for example, but when he can't line up the threads just right, or he forgets that he has to turn the cap counterclockwise to get it off, he flips out and starts flailing.
</p>

</p>


<p>
Speaking of flipping out, it turns out that the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/02/chocolate_pretz.html">chocolate pretzel meldown</a> wasn't a one-time thing. When he sees me eating chocolate, he wants some too&#8212;but he wants to <em>hold</em> it rather than eat it. If I deny him this messy obsession, he goes nuts. We happened to be in the Mission Police Station in San Francisco a couple weeks ago when he caught me trying to eat a piece of See's candy and started gesticulating wildly. I said, "OK, you can have some, but mommy will hold it while you take a bite." This was NOT GOOD ENOUGH, so I caved a bit and said, "OK, you can hold it, but you have to eat it." He took the candy, held it in his hand until it melted, and then melted down himself. WTF?

</p>
<p>
There was one other development that occurred to me while we were out for a family walk tonight, but of course I've forgotten it now. Better just get this out before he turns 17 months, and I miss that update, too.

<p>He is SO CUTE.</p>

<p>I especially love the upper right hand shot.  He looks like such a little man there!</p>

<p>thanks! I agree about the shot on the upper right -- I wish it were sharper, because it's totally frameworthy. :)</p>

<p>Okay...I'm always SO amazed when a child looks and/or acts SO much like a parent?!? Duh! Austen has so much of your personality - independent, so focused, knows exactly what he wants and how he wants it! He is a doll! That sly look is quite cute...almost a "come hither" glance. Oh, he'll be a heartbreaker!</p>
