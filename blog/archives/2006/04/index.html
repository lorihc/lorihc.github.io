<h3 class="title">Pizza Boy</h3>

<p>
Al wanted a night off from cleaning the kitchen, so tonight we had dinner at King of Pizza in New Jersey. We left at 6:45pm, knowing that (a) Austen would probably not get to bed until after 8pm, and (b) that the clocks roll forward tonight, so 8pm really meant 9pm. As I buckled Austen into the car seat, I told him where we were going, as always. "We're going to eat pizza!" I said.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived at King of Pizza, Al whipped out the individual container of cottage cheese and the turkey slices he'd brought for Austen. I usually don't bother bringing food for Austen unless I know there's nothing on the menu that he'd like (a rarity), though I do usually have a fruit bar or some raisins in my purse in case of emergency. Having some Austen-friendly food on hand is never a bad idea, however, so I didn't think it odd that Al had brought some. Austen took a spoonful of cottage cheese and promptly spit it out, I assumed because he was expecting yogurt (the containers look the same). But when he rejected the turkey, the blueberry fruit bar (he *never* rejects fruit bars), and the cerignola olive (his favorite!) we offered him, we started to worry a bit. Then he started to cry.
</p>

<p>
Al and I immediately went into, "tell us what you want, sweetie" mode, trying to be both rational and calming. The snarky sideways look Austen gave me when I said, "how do we ask for what we want?" (the proper answer is to sign "please") totally made us bust out laughing even though we know we're not supposed to do that. Good parents remain stoic and firm in the face of inappropriate but hilarious behavior, but only Al was able to pull the poker face on command.
</p>

<p>
The crying continued until the waitress came over and offered him some Italian Wedding soup with pastini in it. "I don't know if he's crying because he's hungry, but I thought I'd bring him a little soup," she said. He stopped crying long enough to try to charm the waitress, but as soon as she left he clamped his lips shut and refused the soup. When he noticed that soup was all we had to offer, he started to wail again. The waitress returned and asked if she could bring him a taffy, which caused us to stare at her blankly. "You know, a lollipop," she said. We shrugged and said OK.
</p>

<p>
Austen's never had a lollipop before, so when the waitress brought him two DumDums, he promptly tried to stick them in his sippy cup (which he'd been playing with in between&#8212;and during&#8212;screaming fits). I caught them before the candy heads slid into the water and set them aside. We tried again with the soup, but nothing doing.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later the red clam pizza arrived, and Austen suddenly calmed. He opened his mouth willingly when I held out a forkfull of pizza (though it was a bit too hot, and his eyes watered as he swallowed; he took subsequent pieces in his hand so he could test their temperature first). He ate slowly but happily, to our amazement, and didn't fuss again until, at 7:45pm, we tried to pack up the four slices we couldn't finish. He gave an anguished squeal as Al slid the pizza into the box and closed the lid. "I think he wants more pizza," I said to Al. Austen nodded vigorously in agreement. "What do you want to do?" I asked Al. Al voted that we just head home, since it was late and it was already likely that we were going to have to skip bathtime. I told Austen we'd feed him some more pizza in the car. 
</p>

<p>
I ended up feeding Austen another half slice of clam pizza (which was studded with garlic, I might add) in the car on the way home. He conked out with a piece in his hand, and bathtime was indeed skipped, though I did wipe the tomato sauce off his face. I remarked to Al after Austen was safely down in his crib that it's easy to forget that Austen understands a huge amount of what we say, since he doesn't say much himself. He'd obviously understood me when I'd said we were going out for pizza, and he'd cried because he thought we were renegging on the offer. He'd been promised pizza, dammit, and he wasn't going to settle for cottage cheese, turkey, fruit bars, olives, lollipops, or soup.

<h3 class="title">Austen's First Bike Ride</h3>

<p>
Although I've taken my bike into the shop twice since moving to Philadelphia&#8212;once to get a tune-up and once to get a child-seat installed&#8212;up until yesterday I'd yet to actually ride my bike here. Consequently, Austen had never been on a bike ride, either. Yesterday that all changed when Al, Austen, and I braved the incredibly crowded bike path along Boathouse Row (hello, people: KEEP <strong>RIGHT</strong>!).
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26476067@N00/122627579/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/35/122627579_042ec67c5f_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="040206_11021.jpg" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26476067@N00/122621539/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/40/122621539_bca009b2ea_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="040206_11181.jpg" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Austen wasn't too crazy about the helmet or the foot straps, but he really seemed to enjoy the ride. (I tried to forego the footstraps, but he kept kicking my heels as I pedaled. Too bad there were no hand straps, as he also kept poking me in the butt.) His eyes watered from the wind, but he seemed to find the ride relaxing&#8212;in fact, he fell asleep on the return.
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Moral of the Story Is: Don't Whine</h3>

<p>
I am standing in the bathroom, dabbing Neosporin on the bloody patch where my teeth scraped a layer of skin off my lip. Miraculously, this is the first time Austen's managed to draw blood with one of his heat-butts; surprisingly, this is one of the few times he didn't draw tears. I knew the skin was gone immediately, and it hurt immediately&#8212;though the sting is just starting to build up steam now&#8212;and yet I calmly said to Al, seconds after it happened, &quot;I'm going downstairs to get some ice.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Austen is running around the bedroom with a piece of apple in his hand, and between Neosporin dabs I say, &quot;Austen!  Stop running around with that apple! You're going to choke!&quot;
</p>
<p>
It's been a trying day. I mentioned a couple months ago that I wasn't sure whether to wish that Austen would hurry up and start talking, or whether I should be grateful that he wasn't driving me nuts with chatter all day. I can now claim to be firmly in the HURRY UP AND START TALKING camp. I am sick to death of the whining and the gesturing and the melting down when I fail to guess what he wants in three tries or fewer. (I can also do without the tantrums when I guess what he wants right away, but there's no way in hell he's getting it, but that's not related to the not talking.) We all know now that when my patience wears thin it's not good for anyone in the household (or anyone within a 30-mile radius, for that matter); how this managed to remain a secret for so long, I'll never understand, but the point is that Al at least is now well aware of the consequences of wearing on my last nerve. Austen should know, too, and yet the whining continues. Yes, I see you signing &quot;please&quot;. Please WHAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT???
</p>
<p>
We were supposed to go see the Red Sox play the Orioles down at Camden Yards, but as it was pouring rain at 2pm (the game was scheduled for 4:35, and Baltimore is 2 hours away), and the temperature had dropped to 40 degrees, we decided to hope that our $120 worth of tickets would be redeemable on another day (although probably not for a Red Sox game). We were at the mall listening to Austen whine and cry and sign &quot;please&quot; and gesture vaguely when we heard that after a 90-minute rain delay, the game had started. The erosion of my patience had left a gaping wound into which this announcement was poured like a ton of salt.
</p>
<p>
It's 7:30pm now, and I have fed Austen dinner&#8212;or rather, he  fed himself a container of unsweetened strawberry applesauce, a Cerignola olive, and half of a cannoli. He  ignored the two pieces of pineapple he fished out of the container himself because I stuck a fork in one of them for him. He  refused milk because I poured it, and avocado because I handed it to him on a toothpick. These days, he wants nothing unless he can get it for himself without interference.
</p>
<p>
 I have also bathed Austen myself tonight because 
Al is out of commission
 with either food poisoning or the general malaise (fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, and nausea, on top of a lingering sinus infection) that has been plaguing me for the past week. The pre-bath routine involved more whining, crying, and vague gesturing on Austen's part and outright shouting on mine. I tried to be reasonable, to try to explain that all the whining was getting to me, and that I WANTED to get him what HE wanted, if he would only TELL me what he wanted, but of course it did no good. I finally managed to get him into the tub, calmed down, cleaned up, and out again, and after another short crying jag while I tried to get his pajama bottoms  on, we were finally playing happily on the bed. This was when he bashed me in the mouth with that enormous noggin of his.
</p>
<p>
So anyway, Al is flopped on the bed looking like death warmed over and handing a very hyper Austen pieces of apple. I am inspecting my wound (the physical one, not the psychic one) in the bathroom mirror. Austen is running around the room, shrieking through his mouthful of half-chewed apple,  even though I have explicitly shouted STOP RUNNING AROUND WITH THAT APPLE! more than once. Suddenly there is a crash and an apple-choked scream, followed by serious, &quot;I'm injured!&quot; crying. Al crawls out of the bed to pick Austen up off the floor, and I dash over and start fishing pieces of apple out of Austen's mouth so he doesn't inhale one of them. He reaches for me, of course, and I take him. I doubt he  understands why I'm unable to comfort him properly, or what I'm talking about when I mention the boy who whined wolf. He does, however, understand that it's time for bed. He kisses Daddy good night and waves goodbye, and we go upstairs to his room. I don't sing because of my raw and stinging lip and my just-under-the-surface irritation, but he falls asleep in my arms within 10 minutes anyway. 
Hopefully by the time Al brings him to me for his morning cuddle tomorrow, my patience will be full up again. 
</p>
<p>
It'll also help if he's learned a few words.

</p>

<h3 class="title">Neck Obsession</h3>

<p>
Austen is obsessed with my neck. I'm not sure why, but he loves to knead his fists in the little divot where my collarbones come together, and he loves to pat from my shoulders to my jaw with his palms. He gets upset if I have on a fleece that zips up to my chin, and of course lately upset = whine, then cry, then full-on meltdown. It feels almost cheap of me to unzip just to get him to stop fussing.
</p>

<h3 class="title">What Happened to the 16 Month Update?</h3>

<p>
I realized last week that Austen turned 16 months on March 30, and I let the milestone blow by without an update. Every day since then that I've failed to produce an update I've regretted it more, because the developments of last month are quickly being overwhelmed by current cirumstances. I can no longer remember what happened for the first time in March; I only know for sure what's happening now.
</p>

<p>
I'm *pretty* sure that Austen started making the Oh My! face for the first time in his 16th month; I only have one photograph of it, and in it he's facing mostly away from me, but basically it's his version of the face I've been making at him since he was a tiny baby. Emoticonically, it'd be represented by <strong>:o</strong>, or <img src="/blog/images/o_icon.gif" alt="o face" width="24" height="24" class="noborder" style="vertical-align:middle" /> if you use Trillian. In lieu of photos of the Oh My! face, I present Sly Eye and Mischievous Look. 
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/122653125/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/39/122653125_4c514ad647_m.jpg" alt="sly eye" width="160" height="240" /></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/125125694/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/38/125125694_9ff829d36f_m.jpg" alt="mischievous" width="160" height="240" /></a>
</p>
<p>
There's a big milestone that I want to record but that I'm reluctant to mention here because (a) it might attract purient Googlers, and (b) it would totally embarrass Austen later in life (not that all this other stuff won't), even though it's totally normal. I hope that's enough information that when I re-read this two years from now I'll go, "oh, right!" rather than, "what the hell was I referring to there?"
</p>
<p>
Last month was definitely the one in which Austen got practically <em>proficient</em> at walking up and down stairs. He's always been a big fan of climbing stairs one foot at a time&#8212;since before he could walk&#8212;but of course back then we had to hold him up, and the feat required him to lean practically horizontal. A couple weeks ago I caught him <em>holding the railing</em> and <em>walking up the steps himself.</em> He still requires some assistance going down, but he's pretty sharp about the adjustments necessary to descend while holding a sippy cup in one hand vs. when that same hand is free to hold the railing.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure exactly when Austen decided he must become a Big Boy&#8212;was it prior to March 30, or just after?&#8212;but I'm hoping that this DIY fervor will eventually lead to toilet training before age two. Currently it's leading to occasional moments of triumph and delight (look at me sitting in a chair at the table ALL BY MYSELF! if I stand on my tippy toes I can reach the handles of the stroller and push it JUST LIKE MOMMY! this milk tastes even better drunk from a REAL GLASS! <span style="font-size:smaller">oops.</span>), and, more often, to moments of extreme frustration when he can't reach, manipulate, carry, or balance what he wants. He knows how to screw the cap on a bottle, for example, but when he can't line up the threads just right, or he forgets that he has to turn the cap counterclockwise to get it off, he flips out and starts flailing.
</p>
<p class="pictureP"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/127136879/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/44/127136879_87eba499d9_m.jpg" width="240" height="192" alt="pushing stroller" /></a>
</p>


<p>
Speaking of flipping out, it turns out that the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/02/chocolate_pretz.html">chocolate pretzel meldown</a> wasn't a one-time thing. When he sees me eating chocolate, he wants some too&#8212;but he wants to <em>hold</em> it rather than eat it. If I deny him this messy obsession, he goes nuts. We happened to be in the Mission Police Station in San Francisco a couple weeks ago when he caught me trying to eat a piece of See's candy and started gesticulating wildly. I said, "OK, you can have some, but mommy will hold it while you take a bite." This was NOT GOOD ENOUGH, so I caved a bit and said, "OK, you can hold it, but you have to eat it." He took the candy, held it in his hand until it melted, and then melted down himself. WTF?
</p>

</p>
<p>
There was one other development that occurred to me while we were out for a family walk tonight, but of course I've forgotten it now. Better just get this out before he turns 17 months, and I miss that update, too.

<h3 class="title">The Bandolier Idea is Brilliant</h3>

<p>
From Al, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,70652-0.html?tw=wn_index_4">a Wired News article about practical options for carrying a bunch of different electronic devices at once</a>. Several LOL moments, including this one:
</p>

<blockquote>
The problem is that if you strap all of your devices to your belt you don't look a damned thing like Batman. You just look like yourself, only with lumps of plastic holding up your belly like little flying buttresses.

<h3 class="title">Another Checkup at CHOP</h3>

<p>
Austen went in for another well-baby visit today (I can't remember which one it was supposed to be&#8212;maybe 15 months?). Dr. Everly pronounced him "<em>still</em> perfect" and pretty much on target with all the milestones and growth charts. At 26 lbs. 14 oz. and 32 1/4", he's now in the 75th percentile for both weight and height (and head circumference, too, though I can't remember what that measurement was).
</p>

<p>
While Dr. Everly was gearing up to ask us all the milestone questions, Austen marched over to the door, pulled down on the handle (it was an L-shaped one), opened the door, and left. "Well, I guess he knows how to open doors," Dr. E said, "so that answers my first question." I clarified that he can't quite turn round knobs, but he tries. Al chased Austen around the hall while I answered the milestone questions... most of which I can't remember now.
</p>

<p>
I know she asked whether he puts two words together, and I said, "no, he doesn't really talk yet. He's more into signing." "Signing counts!" exclaimed Dr. E. "Oh, then yes, he's put two words together. He signs 'more, please'." He got full marks for that, which made me feel a bit better&#8212;not because he passed a test, but because it didn't seem to matter that he's not really <em>talking</em>.
</p>

<p>
We also talked a bit about the fact that Austen's been whining, crying, and melting down lately, and my best guess about what's going on. I came to the conclusion the other night that he's trying to determine what the appropriate response is to different situations&#8212;and to determine whether *our* response varies according to the situation, or just to how loud he cries/how much he fusses. "That's exactly what he's doing," said Dr. E. While the whining and crying is still extremely annoying, once I was able to break down what I thought he was up to, it became a little easier to deal with. I also made up my mind about <em>how</em> to deal with it&#8212;when I'd be solicitous and when I'd walk away&#8212;but I think Al had a slightly different approach in mind. I didn't mention this to Dr. E, but when Al came back into the room with Austen, she said to him, "you have to resolve to be firm, to stand your ground. If you cave once, it's all over." I wonder how she knew he'd be the most likely to cave? :-)
</p>
<p>
Austen took his last shot until age 4 like a man, ripping the Band-Aid off as soon as the nurse stuck it on, but he whimpered a little when he had his blood drawn for iron and lead levels. He ripped that Band-Aid off right away, too, but there was less bloody mess than there might have been because I was prepared for the move. I grabbed the gauze and applied pressure until the bleeding stopped. After the blood draw he wanted to be picked up&#8212;by Daddy, not by me, of course. I'm the one who'd held him during the draw, and I think he was a little mad about that. By the time we arrived home he'd forgiven me, though, and he helped me vacuum and mop while we waited for Hannah to arrive. Such a good kid.

<h3 class="title">Four Cute Things</h3>

<p>
1. One of Austen's favorite things to do is stand on the counter in front of the spice cabinet and shake the spice jars. On Sunday morning, Al was the one making sure he didn't fall off the counter when Austen leaned his head back to open the cabinet door... and bonked Al in the face. &quot;Uh oh!&quot; said Austen, and he turned to kiss Al and make it better. 
</p>

<p>
2. After breakfast we went out onto the back deck to plant the squash and tomato plants I'd bought, and Austen helped me turn the compost and shovel the dirt into the pots. He got *really* excited, however, when he saw me water the seedlings with the hose. He stuck his hands in front of it and squealed for more, even though he was getting wet. After a few minutes of on-off-on-off with the hose and more giddy squealing, I gave up on keeping him dry and let him have all the water he wanted. Al got some great snaps of the fun, including these (links are to the large versions, which show the best detail):

3. When we got done with the gardening, we decided to go out and try to get some errands done (forgetting it was Easter, of course; we quickly changed plans and went to Princeton for lunch instead). I brought Austen up to the bedroom for a wardrobe change, since he was totally soaked. That mission accomplished, I went into the bathroom to put on a little makeup. I dabbed some foundation under my eyes and then covered my blemishes (zits! yes, I still get zits at 37, sheesh!) with a salicylic acid concealer. Apply concealer, pat pat pat, apply concealer, pat pat pat, etc. I capped the concealer stick, set it aside, and reached for the loose powder. I was dusting my forehead when I noticed Austen to my right in the mirror, poking himself with the concealer stick and then pat pat patting his face with a fingertip. Poke poke, pat pat pat. Poke poke, pat pat pat.
</p>
<p>
4. I decided a few weeks ago that I wanted to introduce the concept of peeing in the toilet to Austen long before we actually expect him to  do it. I suggested that Al pee before getting into the tub with Austen each night, so Austen could see how it worked. After about a week of saying, &quot;look, Daddy's peeing before he gets in the tub!&quot;, we brought in a stepstool, put it in front of the toilet, and said, &quot;do you have to pee too?&quot; We'd lift Austen up onto the stepstool (for some reason, he usually lifts his feet; I think he thinks we're putting him into the toilet, like it's the tub), get him to stand on it, and then say, &quot;ok, your turn to pee!&quot; He never does, of course, but the ritual is fun. (He does know where his p____&#8212;I'm not using the actual word because I'm trying to avoid coming up as a Google result for it, not because I'm shy&#8212;is, btw; I asked him &quot;where's your p____?&quot; one night, and he bent over, spotted it, and pointed. I'm just not certain whether he knows how to use it to pee, consciously.) 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's probably a good thing that Austen hasn't tried to pee in the toilet yet, since there's still a large gap between his p____ and the bowl even when we push the stepstool as close to the toilet as possible. Because of this gap, Al decided to buy Austen his own potty on Saturday. We tried it out for the first time on Sunday night, when, after announcing, &quot;look, Daddy's peeing! Do you need to pee too?&quot;, Austen nodded vigorously. I turned him toward the potty, but he turned back, climbed over me, and ran out of the bathroom.  I poked my head out to see where he was going&#8212;I had visions of him trying to pee in the laundry basket or something&#8212;and I saw him heading for the stepstool, which we keep over by the closet when not in use. &quot;He's getting the stepstool!&quot; I whispered to Al. We giggled quietly and then straightened our faces as Austen marched into the bathroom with the stepstool and plunked it in front of the toilet. He still didn't pee, but hey, it's a start.

<h3 class="title">The Talking Has Begun</h3>

<p>
Austen's been saying&#8212;and, more often, signing&#8212;individual words for a long time now, but recently I've noticed him actively trying to acquire vocabulary. A couple weeks ago he started pointing out trees to me: He wouldn't say anything other than an "eh!" to get my attention, but he'd stand under a tree and point up. "Tree," I'd say. He'd nod thoughtfully; you could see him filing it away.
</p>

<p>
On Monday afternoon after Hannah left (she's only here from 8-3 on Mondays), I decided I was too lazy to walk down to the Old Navy at 11th and Market, so Austen and I took the bus. "We're waiting for the bus," I said to him as we hung out at the corner of 21st and Arch. He then pointed out every 48 bus that went by us on Arch Street (we needed a 48 heading south on 21st) and yelled "ba!" He did the same this morning when we went out for coffee at 8:30 and ran into a cordoned-off Market Street (rumor in the crowd of people milling about, waiting to get into their office buildings, was that there'd been a bomb threat). There were detoured buses stacked up amid all the other traffic, and Austen shouted gleefully, "ba! ba! ba! ba!," pointing at each one.
</p>

<p>
There've been other vocabulary improvements as well. His "no" is now much clearer&#8212;a real "no" instead of a "nah"&#8212;and yesterday when I tried to get his attention after he woke up kind of dazed from a nap by pressing his bellybutton and yelling, "BELLYBUTTON!," he gently pushed my hand away, shook his head, and said "no no do."

<h3 class="title">Blah Blah Blah</h3>

<p>
I was just sitting down to write this post when I saw Josie had commented on the last one. Her comment is directly relevant to this post, so I'll quote part of it here. Regarding toddlers beginning to talk, she wrote:
</p>

<blockquote> ...it is so awesome when they begin repeating what you say and actually knowing what it means! And then they get that "oh look at me, I'm so smart" look on their face! </blockquote>
<p>
Austen did indeed get that "oh, look at me, I'm so smart!" look on his face this morning, when he realized he could TELL US WHAT HE WANTED and that WE COULD UNDERSTAND HIM. The floodgates opened while he was waiting for Al to use the bathroom this morning (it's usually Al who gets up with Austen and feeds him breakfast). He turned his head in my direction (though I don't think he looked at me directly, maybe in case he got his first attempt at using REAL WORDS wrong) and said "go...down...stairs." I couldn't believe my ears, and I shouted to Al, "he just said 'GO DOWNSTAIRS!!'"
</p>
<p>
Apparently encouraged by our enthusiasm, Austen didn't stop there. When I got up about an hour later and joined Al and Austen in the kitchen, he wowed me with the following short sentences: &quot;no, this one&quot; (referring to a box of veggie sausages), &quot;big one&quot; (referring to the one sausage we hadn't broken into little pieces), 
&quot;you eat that one&quot; (referring to that same sausage), &quot;I do&quot; (said several times, when&#8212;as is usual these days&#8212;he wanted to do something for himself instead of having help), &quot;pick up&quot; (when he wanted me to pick him up, obviously), and something that sounded like &quot;I want another piece [of watermelon].&quot; 
</p>
<p>
Of course, I'm not sure anyone other than I, Al, or Hannah could have understood him; it's not like all of his words were clear as a bell. His intent, however, was. It was so clear that he was trying out sounds that he'd heard before&#8212;sounds that he'd guessed had certain meanings&#8212;and that each time we seemed to understand him, he was emboldened to try out some more sounds. It reminded me of someone trying to learn a foreign language: I'm very tentative in Spanish, for example, even though I know quite a bit, and it takes some positive reinforcement in the form of a native speaker understanding me before I'll feel confident enough to utter more than the most rudimentary sentences. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking of foreign languages,  if I ask Austen where his <em>youngmal</em> and <em>kudu</em> are, he'll first turn his palms to the sky as if to say, &quot;how should I know?&quot;, but then he'll look around until he finds his socks and shoes. When  Al asks him &quot;<em>subop juseyo?</em>&quot; he'll nod vigorously; he knows he's being asked if he wants some watermelon. He's never used Korean words, however, even when he got on his talking tear this morning. I woudn't be surprised if he used <em>kudu</em> in a sentence in the near future, but I think he's still only guessing that <em>subop</em> means watermelon. I suspect he'll wait until he's sure what the words mean before he tries them out. (It's also possible that since we only sprinkle Korean words into our English sentences from time to time, he doesn't hear them in context enough to infer their meanings with any degree of certainty&#8212;or that he's unsure why we sometimes say shoes and sometimes <em>kudu</em>.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Austen was obviously very proud of himself this morning and was all, &quot;look at me! I can talk!&quot; He became very hyper when he realized he was being understood, and he started backing up (also a new thing; he's never taken more than a step or two backwards, and this morning he was walking several paces in reverse) and then sprinting forward in a mad dash, giggling like a maniac. He did realize later that there was a limit to what we could understand; he's apparently not getting all of the sounds right, or maybe the sounds don't mean what he thinks they mean. He didn't seem discouraged, however, so I fully expect to hear more talking tomorrow. I can't wait to hear what he says next.

<h3 class="title">Dumb</h3>

<p>
I just got a text message from Hannah:
</p>

<blockquote>
This is what it's coming to: A just turned around, pointed at me&amp; said "dumb." r we sure we want him2 "use his words"?
</blockquote>

<h3 class="title">The Potato Says...</h3>

<p>
I should preface this post by saying that I am more or less following a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345441338/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">plan</a> to get control of my mood swings, irritability, occasional bouts of depression, and generally erratic behavior, and that this plan involves eating a potato every night at bedtime. The potato is designed to boost my serotonin levels a bit&#8212;emphasis on <strong>a bit</strong>. Too much potato = too much serotonin = headaches and wild dreams. So this could all just be the potato talking.
</p>

<p>
Last night I dreamed I had breast cancer. I also dreamed that I went to visit my dear friend and former roommate Pat... who died of breast cancer in 1998. I can't remember if the two dreams were intertwined, or if one came before the other; I just know that both dreams were vivid and memorable.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pat Dream: </strong>I have no idea where we were, except that it was wherever Pat happened to be living (or not living, as the case may be). There was another woman there whom I know I should have recognized, but I can't think now who she could have been. Anyway, I remember that Pat proposed going on a bike ride, and I said, "I almost packed my biking shoes and clothes because I thought you'd want to go for a ride... but then I remembered that my bicycle isn't here, so having the right shoes and clothes wouldn't help." Pat and her friend rode their bikes, and I kind of tagged along on foot. I remember trying to catch up with Pat, both literally (I was obviously slower on foot that she was on a bike) and in the "what have you been up to?" sense.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Breast Cancer Dream: </strong>I was in a doctor's office or hospital (though the chair I was sitting in was more like a dentist's chair) getting some tests done. I remember the doctor being really nice and very professional, and I remember him telling me all kinds of things about the test results and going over "options." I remember looking at (and getting a copy of) the test results. As soon as I left the office, however, I realized that we'd talked a lot about what seemed like breast cancer treatment options... but that he'd never actually said I had breast cancer. Did I have breast cancer???
</p>

<p>
I went back to the office and asked to see the doctor again. He'd gone out or into surgery or something and wasn't available. I asked to see someone else, but I couldn't get anyone's attention. I remember looking at the nameplates that were hanging on the wall beyond the receptionist's desk to see how many doctors were in the office. 
</p>

<p>
The next major chunk of the dream was spent in trying to find someone, anyone, who could tell me whether I had breast cancer or not. It took a huge amount of time and effort on my part to find someone who wasn't busy&#8212;or who would even look at me. Finally I found a nurse practitioner who would give me the time of day. I remember she was blond, with a bob haircut (and now that I think of it, this archetypal woman has been in several of my dreams lately). I said, "I had a, um," and I totally couldn't remember the name of the test, so I waved my hand in front of my chest as I "ummmed".
</p>
<p>
"Mammogram?" she supplied.<br />
"No, it wasn't a mammogram," I said. "There was no squishing involved."<br />
"Oh, I know the test you mean," she said. I couldn't remember if she told me the name of it or not; if she did, I can't remember it now. I just remember that it involved lasers.<br />
"Right, well, these are my results," I said, indicating a sheet with two lines on it, one much longer than the other. "Does this mean I have breast cancer?"<br />
"Yes," she replied.<br />
</p>

<p>
Oddly, I felt a little relieved&#8212;finally, I knew for sure. "Is it bad that my line [on the results] is so much longer than the normal, reference line?" I asked. The nurse rubbed her forehead with her hand, and I knew it *was* bad. "Jeez," I muttered. "Now everyone's going to blame me for not getting a mammogram. I'm 37, for chrissakes! How many mammograms do you really need in your life? And what do they do for you, anyway, besides scare the crap out of you?" [Aside: Pat got regular mammograms, and she had to go through several scares over what turned out to be fibroids... and they didn't catch what did turn out to be cancer until it was too late. She had some weird inflammation that the doctors wrote off as a 'systemic infection', but we suspect it was her lymph nodes getting attacked/trying to fight off cancer.]
</p>

<p>
The nurse replied, "mammograms are good for finding masses, but that's not what you have. I don't think a mammogram would have found anything for you." Just then a bell rang, like a school bell at the end of a period. The nurse said, "oh, 6:00, gotta go," and like everyone else pouring out of their offices at that moment, she turned and ran for the elevator. I was left standing there, wondering how the hell I was going to get down from the 39th floor with the elevators so jammed with people.
</p>

<p>
Of course, that wasn't the only thing I was wondering. As I made my way to the stairs with an idea of walking down to my office on the 37th floor (hello? I work at home) and working a while&#8212;at least until the elevators were clear&#8212;I started thinking about what my plan should be. Should I bother with chemo and radiation in an attempt to prolong my life, when those treatments were so likely to drastically impact the *quality* of my life? Or should I just try to live the best life I could for the next year or year and a half that I had left? I was leaning toward the latter when I slipped on some files someone had left on the stairs, landed at the bottom next to Jack Herrington's (my old cubemate's) cube, said hi to Jack, and then got lost looking for my cube because I didn't recognize the office at all after the Macromedia-Adobe merger.
</p>

<p>
I don't remember whether I woke up because I was lost, or because I heard Austen wake up in his crib upstairs. I just know that I heard Austen give his "I'm UP" squeak shortly after realizing I was awake. Both dreams were vivid and immediate in my head, as if I'd dreamed them simultaneously.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Guess What a Dinner of Watermelon and Prunes Gets You?</h3>

<p>
We mostly let Austen choose what he wants to eat*, and last night he chose a jar of Earth's Best prunes and oatmeal (stocked in case of constipation, which is a rare but painful occurance for Austen) and half a large tub of watermelon from Whole Foods. Lest you think we don't feed him proper, balanced meals, he also ate some popcorn and half a piece of shrimp.
</p>

<p>
It probably isn't difficult to guess what happened today. Well, you might not have guessed that I'm behind on the laundry and that Austen only had one clean pair of pants this morning, or that we ran out of wipes last night. But you can probably guess the rest. Poor Austen.
</p>
<p style="font-size:smaller">
*we do deny him unlimited supplies of whipped cream.
