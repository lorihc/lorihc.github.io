<h3 class="title">Kneebouncers</h3>

<p>
Ann, the babysitter who worked with us this summer (and who was filling in with us yesterday), noticed that Austen was a BIG fan of typing on my laptop (and of prying off the keys&#8212;yesterday he got the F key, and on Friday he'd gotten the spacebar) and recommended <a href="http://www.kneebouncers.com/" target="a8_win">kneebouncers.com</a> as a site Austen might like to visit. It's a site designed by a group of creative dads who noticed that there's not much on the web for really little kids and decided to do something about it. They created a bunch of Flash games that respond to any key press (and often in a different way to multiple keys pressed at once). Don't worry if the games don't seem to make any sense; your toddler will still be mesmerized. Oh, and be sure to turn on the sound!

<p>This is a great idea.  I'd been thinking for awhile that it would be cool to write some kid's software that responded to random key presses, but didn't have the Flash/design skills to come up with anything neat.</p>

<p>Thanks!  The kneebouncers site is great.  My 8 month old is very interested in the computer (I'm trying to work part-time from home) but I hadn't found anything suitable for him.</p>

<p>I've been reading for just about a year and can't even remember now how I found your site. We used to live out near Valley Forge Park and so enjoy hearing you talk about Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Austen sure is cute!   </p>

<p>Hi, Lara -- thanks for reading! My friend Shannon lives out in West Chester, and she recommended Valley Forge Park as a fun place to go when the weather is nice, but we've yet to actually meet up there. Perhaps in the spring!</p>
