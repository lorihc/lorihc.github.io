<h3 class="title">Happy New Year!</h3>

<p>
It's just starting to sink in that it's 2006 already, and especially that it's January now, not December. We returned from a family-friendly New Year's Eve gathering at Matt and Shannon's house at around 10pm last night and were in bed, asleep, by 11:20pm, which is probably why we failed to notice the turn of the year. Today we drove down to Maryland for the day to play a game of Trivial Pursuit with my parents and our good friends Anne and Peggy (a New Year's Day tradition) and to eat a huge spread of food prepared by Anne and my dad. (Back when I was in college and later when I would visit as a singleton, I was part of the buffet preparations, too, but now I'm just an Eater of the Bounty.) Both nights we changed Austen into his jammies before heading for home, and both nights he did not wake when we transferred him from the car to his crib. 
</p>
<p>
As I write this the Mac screensaver is showing me my favorite photos from the past year on the TV (which we use as the monitor); it's so weird seeing Austen grow from tiny baby to active toddler. There's the one where he first learned to stand, the one where Alexander is looking on as Austen sticks out his tongue, the one where he's bald and beautiful at the Philadelphia Flower Show. There's his first experience in an Exersaucer, the days when he fit on a forearm, the messy first feedings, his first pair of shoes. Oh wow, I'd forgotten about his frog hat, and the early post-partum days when I'd dyed my hair purple. It's been quite a year here at Casa Hylan-Cho.
</p>

<p>
Hope 2006 brings all of us peace, prosperity, and perhaps a little adventure. If you want it, that is.

<p>I'm a bit late, but the happiest of new years to the Hylan-Cho family! I have been keeping up with you, but even though I'm on break it doesn't really feel like a break. Must be my age...UGH! I can't stop DOING things around the house. I loved the photos of Austen's birthday party. What a fabulous tradition! Hope all is well...hi to Al!</p>
