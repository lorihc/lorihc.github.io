Al is standing right in front of the little TV in the kitchen, eating cereal. I am in the dining room, falling asleep in front of the computer.

<p>
Me: "What was that? President Bush just walked into the end zone?"
</p>

<p>

<p>That was an AWESOME championship game last night... you can't beat watching a football game with two teams that you don't really care about (so you're not concerned with WHO wins) that goes down to the wire with lead changes and a thrilling finish.</p>

<p>I think leaving the "l" out of "ly" qualifies as a typo, not a misspelling. :) It's fixed.</p>
