<h3 class="title">An Interesting Idea From Derek</h3>

<p>
I love visiting Derek's site because in addition to great writing, great photographs, and great links, <a href="http://www.powazek.com/" target="a8_win">This Is Powazek</a> is also full of great ideas. Today's interesting idea: create a <a href="http://flagrantdisregard.com/flickr/mosaic.php">mosaic</a> of photos from your Flickr stream (or your favorites list, or any other photos on the web). I've used Picasa2's Collage feature to create mosaics before (most notably <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/68708919/">the one commemorating Austen's first year</a>), so the mosaic part isn't the great idea. It's that Derek chose to make a mosaic of the <a href="http://www.powazek.com/2006/01/000558.html" target="a8_win">top 20 photos</a> from his Flickr stream, as determined by the number of people "favoriting" them.
</p>
<p>
This seemed like a really interesting idea&#8212;one so interesting that I decided to create a mosaic of my most interesting photos of 2005. "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/" target="a8_win">Interestingness</a>" takes account of a bunch of factors, not just whether someone has clicked the Favorite button. (While I do have 20 photos in my Flickr stream that people have marked favorites, I don't have the kind of traffic Derek does&#8212;and thus "most-favorited" seems a vast overstatement.) The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/60183194/">photo of Austen watching Valerie play the violin</a>, for example, is #17 among my most interesting photos even though no one has marked it a favorite. (How no one could mark this a favorite I'll never understand, since it's definitely one of mine.) The fact that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/60183194/">small audience</a> is my most-viewed photo certainly is a contributing factor to its interestingness, but it can't be the only one; none of my other top 20 most-viewed photos made the top 20 most interesting. 
</p>

<p>
So anyway, here's to interestingness&#8212;and to being more interesting in 2006.
