<h3 class="title">Happy New Year!</h3>

<p>
It's just starting to sink in that it's 2006 already, and especially that it's January now, not December. We returned from a family-friendly New Year's Eve gathering at Matt and Shannon's house at around 10pm last night and were in bed, asleep, by 11:20pm, which is probably why we failed to notice the turn of the year. Today we drove down to Maryland for the day to play a game of Trivial Pursuit with my parents and our good friends Anne and Peggy (a New Year's Day tradition) and to eat a huge spread of food prepared by Anne and my dad. (Back when I was in college and later when I would visit as a singleton, I was part of the buffet preparations, too, but now I'm just an Eater of the Bounty.) Both nights we changed Austen into his jammies before heading for home, and both nights he did not wake when we transferred him from the car to his crib. 
</p>

<p>
As I write this the Mac screensaver is showing me my favorite photos from the past year on the TV (which we use as the monitor); it's so weird seeing Austen grow from tiny baby to active toddler. There's the one where he first learned to stand, the one where Alexander is looking on as Austen sticks out his tongue, the one where he's bald and beautiful at the Philadelphia Flower Show. There's his first experience in an Exersaucer, the days when he fit on a forearm, the messy first feedings, his first pair of shoes. Oh wow, I'd forgotten about his frog hat, and the early post-partum days when I'd dyed my hair purple. It's been quite a year here at Casa Hylan-Cho.
</p>

<p>
Hope 2006 brings all of us peace, prosperity, and perhaps a little adventure. If you want it, that is.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Austen Has a Long-Lost Twin Named Charlie</h3>

<p>
I got hooked on <a href="http://alittlepregnant.typepad.com/" target="a8_win">a little pregnant</a> back when I was, well, pregnant. Julie was due exactly two months after me, and it was fun and interesting to follow her pregnancy as I lived and wrote about my own. Needless to say, I was shocked when her son Charlie was born three days before Austen instead of two months after him.
</p>

<p>
I've been amazed to discover, despite Charlie's prematurity and attendant health issues, how much the two kids have in common. Although Austen doesn't eat at Friendly's regularly (it was one of our first meals out after he was born, but the service at the Friendly restaurants in our area is so abysmal that we don't bother anymore), almost everything in <a href="http://alittlepregnant.typepad.com/alittlepregnant/2005/12/friendly.html" target="a8_win">this post</a> could be said of Austen as well. He is SO much more outgoing than either Al or I. It's one of the things I love about him, one of the ways in which he's made my life better&#8212;I'd be far more surly, far less interactive, far more awkward and fumbling if Austen weren't by my side, trying to engage every single person he sees.
</p>

<p>
I know it's New Year's, not Thanksgiving, but I just want to say how thankful I am that I got such a wonderful kid for a son&#8212;and how thankful I am that Julie did, too.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Apparently Our President Plays Football</h3>

<p>
Al is standing right in front of the little TV in the kitchen, eating cereal. I am in the dining room, falling asleep in front of the computer. 
</p>



<p>
Me: "What was that? President Bush just walked into the end zone?"
</p>

<p>
Yes indeed, it is time for bed. (And apparently it wasn't President Bush who walked into the end zone, it was <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls05/bowls?game=rose" target="a8_win">LenDale White</a>.)

<h3 class="title">An Interesting Idea From Derek</h3>

<p>
I love visiting Derek's site because in addition to great writing, great photographs, and great links, <a href="http://www.powazek.com/" target="a8_win">This Is Powazek</a> is also full of great ideas. Today's interesting idea: create a <a href="http://flagrantdisregard.com/flickr/mosaic.php">mosaic</a> of photos from your Flickr stream (or your favorites list, or any other photos on the web). I've used Picasa2's Collage feature to create mosaics before (most notably <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/68708919/">the one commemorating Austen's first year</a>), so the mosaic part isn't the great idea. It's that Derek chose to make a mosaic of the <a href="http://www.powazek.com/2006/01/000558.html" target="a8_win">top 20 photos</a> from his Flickr stream, as determined by the number of people "favoriting" them.
</p>

<p>
This seemed like a really interesting idea&#8212;one so interesting that I decided to create a mosaic of my most interesting photos of 2005. "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/" target="a8_win">Interestingness</a>" takes account of a bunch of factors, not just whether someone has clicked the Favorite button. (While I do have 20 photos in my Flickr stream that people have marked favorites, I don't have the kind of traffic Derek does&#8212;and thus "most-favorited" seems a vast overstatement.) The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/60183194/">photo of Austen watching Valerie play the violin</a>, for example, is #17 among my most interesting photos even though no one has marked it a favorite. (How no one could mark this a favorite I'll never understand, since it's definitely one of mine.) The fact that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/60183194/">small audience</a> is my most-viewed photo certainly is a contributing factor to its interestingness, but it can't be the only one; none of my other top 20 most-viewed photos made the top 20 most interesting. 
</p>

<p>
So anyway, here's to interestingness&#8212;and to being more interesting in 2006.

<p>
I've been complaining off and on for years now that I get mail/calls for Lori H. Cho when that's not me, but now I'm starting to wonder if there *is* a Lori H. Cho somewhere&#8212;one who's over the age of 55&#8212;and whether my records have somehow gotten mixed up with hers. I should check my credit report just to make sure nothing funny is going on.

<h3 class="title">Excellent Interview About Reconstruction</h3>

<p>
I'm listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5133942" target="a8_win">a Fresh Air program on Reconstruction</a> at the moment, and it's fascinating. Great review of this period in history, as well as Constitutional issues in general.  <a href="http://www.ericfoner.com/" target="a8_win">Eric Foner</a> is surprisingly mesmerizing. [Downloadable audio should be available on the WHYY site shortly.]

<h3 class="title">Mmmm, Mmmm Good</h3>

<p>
I feel like monthly updates are just not frequent enough to document Austen's development anymore. Perhaps they never have been, and I've just convinced myself over the past few months that I have to save everything up for the end of the month. Well, no more: I can't let another minute go by without detailing some of the amazing things I've seen in the past couple days. (Of course, they will be amazing to no one else, but I will relate them anyway.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mmmmmmmmmmm ~ </strong>When Austen started playing with pots, I would occasionally stir the pot for him and bring the spoon or spatula to my mouth, pretend to taste what was on it, and then say, "mmmmm, good!" He thought this was SO COOL and would occasionally poke me in the mouth with the spatula to get me to make the slurpy tasting sound. Within a few days, he was tasting the contents of the pot himself. When I said to him, "what are you cooking? Can Mommy have a taste?", he'd bring the spatula to his own mouth, chew on it for a second, and then say, "Mmmmmmmmmmm".  It was a short leap from that to saying "Mmmmmmmmmmm" every time he ever ate or drank anything (and sometimes even just when sitting in his car seat, in an effort to engage me). 
</p>

<p>
Tonight, Austen graduated from "Mmmmmmmmmmm" to "&aacute;hh!", which he correctly identified as the appropriate noise to make after taking a sip of a particularly refreshing drink. It's not that "Mmmmmmmmmmm" is <em>wrong</em> after taking a swig of milk or fizzy water or homemade chai eggnog latte (which we shared while playing on the floor after dinner tonight); it's that "&aacute;hh!" is more specific.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Bottle skillz ~ </strong>Remember how <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/11/twelve_months.html">I said</a> we weren't sure whether Austen could hold a bottle by himself, and how relieved we were when he finally figured out how to use a sippy cup? Well, he's now drinking out of 25 oz. sport-top water bottles all by himself. He even knows how to close the tops so they don't spill (though he doesn't always do it). It's a sight to behold... which of course means I don't have a photo of him doing it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Push-ups ~ </strong>I noticed yesterday that Austen is finally using the technique I saw <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/mirandatime/" target="a8_win">Miranda</a> employ way back in <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/04/morrisa_miranda_1.html">early April last year</a> when he falls and needs to get back up: Namely, he pushes himself up into a sort of downward dog pose and then stands from there. Previously he'd been shuffling over on his butt or knees to the nearest wall, toilet, bed, or other stationary object and using that as leverage to pull himself up. This, it strikes me, is progress.
</p>

<p>
It was interesting just now to read the first paragraph of the April post I linked to in the previous paragraph and realize that Austen is now the same age Miranda was then. At the time, I hadn't wanted to think of Austen at this age; now it's hard to remember a time when he wasn't walking and babbling and telling me in his own version of sign language and grunts that he's hungry or thirsty, that he wants a different pot, or that he's ready for bed.
</p>

<p>
He actually did this on Saturday night, incidentally: He ASKED to go to bed. He got Al to pick him up and then led Al, by swaying his body, to the stairs, where he rubbed his eyes and reached upward with both arms. The signal was unmistakable&#8212;as unmistakable as when he clapped his hands and then rubbed his eyes, clapped his hands and then rubbed his eyes again as I finished changing a poopy diaper at 11:15am yesterday. He'd obviously been postponing nap time&#8212;which is usually between 9:30am and 11:00am&#8212;until he could get a poop in, and now that the poopy diaper was taken care of, he wanted to go down asap. "MORE SLEEP, Mommy! MORE SLEEP!" (He was out cold by the time we got to the end of the block in the stroller a few minutes later.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>I'M <em>FRUSTRATED!!</em> ~ </strong>One of the other unmistakable non-verbal communiqu&eacute;s Austen's been sending us lately is the one that means, "I'M <em><strong>FRUSTRATED!!</strong></em>" (It can also mean "I'M ANGRY!!") He squats, balls his hands into fists and shakes them, and grunt-screams. He'll sometimes do it repeatedly, turning redder and redder each time. We're trying various methods to break him of this habit, including ignoring him, asking him to tell us what he wants, explaining that temper tantrums are not acceptable, or whatever seems appropriate at the time. We're hoping that as he acquires more vocabulary (currently we're still on "mama", "dada", "uh-oh", and an occasional "Hannah" and "nana"), he'll also have less need for such a simultaneously hilarious and annoying gesture. [I just totally cracked Al up by imitating the "frustrated" gesture in an attempt to accurately describe it.]

<h3 class="title">6.50</h3>

<p>
I had a dream last night that the plan to hire me back full-time at my old company had been delayed, and that in the meantime I was going to contract for them. My boss' boss asked me what I proposed for an hourly rate. After doing some quick math in my head that involved my old salary*, I came up with $6.50 an hour.
</p>



<p>
It was only after I got my first paycheck and saw how small it was that I realized I'd made a mistake with the decimal point&#8212;I should have proposed $65 an hour, not $6.50! This stupid math error haunted the rest of my dreams, even after my fast-asleep mind moved on to unrelated topics. How was I going to pay the babysitter on only $6.50 an hour? How was I going to support my family?  The undercurrent of "6.50... 6.50... 6.50" kept niggling at me until it finally woke me up.
</p>

<p>
*Neither $6.50 or $65 have any relation to my old salary. Obviously my sleep mind can't do math.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Surprise!</h3>

<p>
I remember being in the car with my mom one time, back when I was in college, when she expressed surprise at some detail or other I'd just related about my life. This intrigued me, and I asked her what else about me surprised her. She responded, "well, if the list were very long I'd have to say I didn't know you very well." I wonder if more about me would surprise her now, or whether I've become more predictable over time. I certainly suspect that in the early days of parenthood the surprises came fast and furious.
</p>

<p>
This is my experience, in any case; as well as I think I know Austen, he's developing so fast that there are times when he'll do something that just makes my jaw drop. There are other parenting surprises as well&#8212;perhaps the biggest one of all being that I actually have a parenting instinct&#8212;ranging from things we thought we knew but didn't to things we thought would never change but did. Some recent surprises:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Austen is watching. </strong>I knew that I could demonstrate behaviors and eventually Austen would learn to repeat them, but I didn't realize how closely he was watching me when my intention was not to model behavior. For example, last week I noticed that when he's "cooking" on his ottoman, Austen will tap the spatula on the edge of the pot when he's done stirring and then move the spatula to another pot. I do this when I'm cooking: I tap the excess food off my spatula, and then stand it up in an empty can or measuring cup. I've also noticed that he's picked up my stirring and scraping techniques. [This reminds me of the time my sister and I were in a supermarket with her two year-old son, chatting while we inspected the mangoes. We would sniff each one to see if it was ripe, and if it passed muster, we'd put it in our cart. The next thing we knew, J, who had his own little kid-sized cart, picked up a mango, jammed it up his nose, and then tossed it into his cart. My sister and I looked at each other with our eyes bugged out for a second, and then we CRACKED UP.]
</p>

<p>
<strong>Austen is expected to drink two cups of milk a day. </strong>I remember reading somewhere the question, "how much milk should I give my baby?", but I don't remember the entire answer. I only remember that there was an admonishment not to give too much, since cow's milk is designed for the nutritional needs of fast-growing calves, not slower-growing human babies. I found out at our doctor's visit on Friday that the cup to a cup-and-a-half that I rather guiltily admitted to giving Austen was actually insufficient. Apparently he needs at least two cups a day, unless he's eating two or three yogurts a day. (Luckily, most days he *is* eating two yogurts a day.) I realized I'm sort of winging it on the nutritional front, figuring that if Austen eats better than I do, he's ahead of the game. Honestly, though, I should never be anyone's nutritional standard, much less a growing child's. I'd say it's probably time to read up on child nutrition, but my instinct says to just keep feeding him a wide variety of stuff, and he'll probably turn out OK.
</p>

<p>
<strong>My, that's SALTY. </strong>I've definitely experienced the increased sensitivity to sugar that comes from not eating sweets, but I've never really believed&#8212;or had the opportunity to experience for myself&#8212;an increased sensitivity to salt. Compared to Al and his family, I'm a saltaholic... though compared to my own family, I eat hardly any. (My mom instituted the policy of "separate salt and pepper shakers for each person," probably because she could never wrest the salt shaker away from my dad. Mom salts EVERYTHING from cantaloupe to ice cream, and my dad can't eat anything unless it's covered in a crust of salt and pepper. For the record, all three of us have blood pressure that's normal to low.)
</p>

<p>
I've never been a big fan of salt *in* food, but I do love big, crunchy kosher or sea salt crystals on top of pasta, lentil stew, soft pretzels, eggs, and more. Since Austen started eating off my plate a few months ago, however, I not only stopped adding any salt to foods I was cooking (any recipe that said "salt to taste" or "season well with salt and pepper" got none), but I also stopped adding so much salt on top of the food. Sometimes I add a bit to half the plate, but more often than not I just don't add any. As a consequence, when we stopped at Tampopo for sushi a couple weeks ago, I said to Al, "something's wrong with this soy sauce. It's SUPER salty." Al laughed and said that that's the way it'd always been&#8212;I'd just never noticed before. Needless to say, it's now almost impossible for me to eat my parents' cooking, and I was a bit sad to discover that the two potato knishes I bought at Artie's in NYC on Friday were much saltier than I'd remembered. They were still the best knishes I've ever had, but so, so salty.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Austen can reach doorknobs, tabletops, and cooktops now. </strong>I should have known this day was coming, but it still caught me by surprise. I think what changed&#8212;in addition to Austen growing about an inch in the past three months&#8212;is that he's become very proficient at standing on his tippytoes and reaching. He's also become quite a climber (he tries to climb into the tub himself now), and he'll stand on anything that will help him reach his goal, from pillows and boxes to my laptop. =:o This new reach combined with his love of pots has required me to emphasize that he should NEVER, EVER grab a pot off the stove. I've also tried to teach him that the red lights mean that the cooktop is HOT. I hope he's soaking in this information.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Kneebouncers</h3>

<p>
Ann, the babysitter who worked with us this summer (and who was filling in with us yesterday), noticed that Austen was a BIG fan of typing on my laptop (and of prying off the keys&#8212;yesterday he got the F key, and on Friday he'd gotten the spacebar) and recommended <a href="http://www.kneebouncers.com/" target="a8_win">kneebouncers.com</a> as a site Austen might like to visit. It's a site designed by a group of creative dads who noticed that there's not much on the web for really little kids and decided to do something about it. They created a bunch of Flash games that respond to any key press (and often in a different way to multiple keys pressed at once). Don't worry if the games don't seem to make any sense; your toddler will still be mesmerized. Oh, and be sure to turn on the sound!

<h3 class="title">Sick</h3>

<p>
We are all sick here at Casa Hylan-Cho. Austen has been sick almost continuously since he caught the cold I had at Christmas, and I have been sick off and on with various chest and sinus afflictions since before that. At the moment, Al's the sickest of us all; he's been home from work for a couple days now. I've been washing my hands like a maniac, but as I've said to Al, that doesn't help so much when your infant son is sticking his boogers up your nose&#8212;booger-to-booger contact being the #1 method of disease transmission. I'm hoping that since we all seem to have the same thing now that we'll all get better at the same time, and that we'll stop giving this virus a chance to mutate and attack again.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, we're going through Kleenex (both the Lotion and Anti-Viral varieties) at an alarming rate, especially since Austen finds great joy in pulling as many of them out of the box as he can at one sitting. The other night I found him in the linen closet, attempting to pry great wads of tissue from under the plastic wrapping that covered one of the stand-up boxes. This morning he seemed to get the hang of the whole Kleenex Conservation thing, though: He pulled one out of the box, held it up to his face,  made a noise that sounded like &quot;ahroooooo&quot;, and  then held the tissue to my face and gestured as if to say, &quot;now you!&quot; I guess it's better than having the boogers shoved directly up my nose. 
</p>
<p>
As much icky goo as is coming out of Austen's nose, I think more of it's going down his throat and into his stomach. Yesterday morning, after waking up at the completely normal time of 6:10am, he rather <em>ab</em>normally screamed for 20 minutes and then conked out again on his sheepskin rug in the basement 'til 9:30. Al watched him sleep for two hours, but I only lasted 30 minutes before I had to get things done up in the kitchen. When I finally heard him stir, I called, "good morning, sleepyhead!" and headed down to get him. As I reached the gate at the bottom of the basement stairs, he said, "Uh oh! Uh oh!" and then horked all over the sheepskin rug.
I quickly climbed over the gate, at which point he started to say "uh oh!" again but was interrupted by a heave. It was so cute how he was obviously fighting the urge to vomit (and he was largely successful&#8212;although he heaved a bit more, only a little dribble came out). Luckily, he held his breakfast of milk and Bear Naked Triple Berry Oatmeal down just fine.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow we are all driving down to Wheaton, MD so Austen and I can get our hair cut by my favorite stylist, Toni at HUGO Salon. We're both looking rather shaggy these days; Austen hasn't had a proper haircut since I cut off his Gollum strands back when he was seven months old (which I guess means he's never had a proper haircut), and I haven't had one since my hair was purple back in May. I have some nostalgia for both that cut and the purple color, but I'm reluctant to dye it when we're about to take a vacation that will involve lots of swimming and sweating, and I'm not sure Toni will feel as inspired by my plain white hair as she was by the purple. I guess we'll see... I'll hopefully have some before and after photos of us to post tomorrow night.

<h3 class="title">Haircuts</h3>

<p>
As promised, here are the before and after photos from Austen and Lori's Haircut Adventure. The cut I got is very similar to the one I got in May, only with shorter bangs and the part on the opposite side. (I kinda wish she'd left the bangs a bit longer, but I think she did it this way to even them up&#8212;they were shorter on the right than the left.) Austen got his cut while sitting on my lap (good thing we brought a spare shirt for him to change into, because we didn't bother with a drape). We distracted him with a cell phone while Toni made a few strategic snips.

<h3 class="title">And More Sick</h3>

<p>
From about 9pm to 1am last night, I was plagued with what I can only assume was food poisoning. I'm guessing&#8212;but cannot prove&#8212;that the culprit was a Brazilian Shrimp Burrito from Whole Foods; I got a bad one once before and almost swore off them completely back then. I *will* be swearing off them completely from now on. I was worried that I might never be able to eat another orange as well after last night's drama&#8212;an orange being the last thing I ate, in an attempt to soothe myself, before the vomiting started&#8212;but I don't feel the same aversion to them that I did at midnight, thank goodness. California navels are in season right now (for east-coasters who are used to getting California oranges year-round and were unaware that there *was* a season, it usually runs from late January through March), which means they're cheaper, sweeter, and more abundant than usual. I've been known to subsist entirely on oranges when the CA navel season and a particularly stressful period at work coincided, so giving them up would have been so, so sad.
</p>


<p>
 Although I find myself with no particular aversion to oranges this morning, I don't think it would be in my best interest to eat one for breakfast. I seem to be done with the vomiting, and I *am* starving, but it's hard to imagine actually eating any of the foods we have in the house at the moment. Maybe if I hunt around a bit more, I'll locate some saltines.
</p>
<p>
I think one thing that's adding to the lingering nausea is the fact that we have a temporary babysitter today; Hannah doesn't start full-time with us until next week, and I'm already working, so we needed to cover today and Thursday of this week. The temp sitter is totally fine, but as I hadn't met her before today, I have more butterflies than usual when Austen's out of my sight (as he is now&#8212;they're out with the stroller). I'm sure everything's OK, but I'm still fighting the urge to call her cell and tell her to COME BACK RIGHT NOW so I can hug my kid.

<h3 class="title">Fill in the Blank</h3>

<p>
I was just reading Saturday's washingtonpost.com news summary, which was topped by the following entry:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/20/AR2006012001853.html" target="a8_win">Rove Offers Republicans A Battle Plan For Elections</a><br />
White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove offered a biting preview of the 2006 midterm elections yesterday, drawing sharp distinctions with the Democrats over the campaign against terrorism, tax cuts and judicial philosophy, and describing the opposition party as backward-looking and bereft of... 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It was easy to guess what word the ellipses replaced&#8212;I'm familiar with Republican talking points by now&#8212;but it amused me to come up with possible alternatives to the obvious. Some <strong>ideas</strong> that maybe Karl can use next time, if he wants to shake things up a bit:
</p>

<p>
style<br />
fashion sense<br />
anything remotely resembling a sense of humor<br />
a spine<br />
a game plan for invading Iran<br />
friends at Halliburton<br />
Bush baggage (bonus: this one's alliterative!)
</p>

<h3 class="title">Whom Do We Have to Petition To Get A Stop Sign?</h3>

<p>
As I walked up 21st Street this morning on my way back from a doctor's appointment, I could see a Streets Department truck parked at our intersection. Two workers were straightening out the Stop sign on Cherry, which had apparently been run down by a driver eager to get his accident over with. (The guy who hit the owner of this grille on Friday evening around 7:30  was probably the impatient motorist in question.)
</p>


<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/91071690/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/43/91071690_e0a9525875_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="debris from the latest accident at our intersection" /></a>
</p>
<p>
 I hurried to catch the workers before they could jump back into the truck, and asked one of them if their appearance meant that we'd FINALLY be getting a Stop sign on 21st.
</p>
<p>
"No," said my informant, "but you need one."<br />
"Yes, we do," I replied. "We have an accident here at least once a month."<br />
"Yeah, when I worked sanitation we used to hate this corner. People use this street like a drag strip."<br />
"And because of that, the drivers trying to cross 21st feel the need to floor it at the first break in traffic. We've been taking photos of the accidents and sending them to the Streets Department and our city councilman," I added, "but we've gotten no response."<br />
The worker raised his eyebrows and shook his head in simultaneous gestures of surprise and resignation.<br />
"Oh well," I said. "Bummer we're not getting a sign today. We'll keep sending the photos, I guess. Have a nice day."<br />
"You, too!" he said.

<h3 class="title">Stories from the Street</h3>

<p>
Recently I ordered Austen a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C05MP/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Songs from the Street</a>, and it arrived yesterday. I popped Disc One into the Mac and pressed play in iTunes... and Austen kinda freaked out. He knows that when he sees the iTunes interface that he's about to hear some music, but <em>this</em> music usually means that there's a big yellow bird, some kids, some blocks, and Central Park up on the screen. WHERE THE HELL WAS BIG BIRD?
</p>

<p>
Austen looked stricken for a few seconds, and then he ran over to the table where I'd left the CD box&#8212;a table that's above his eye level&#8212;and started fishing around with his arm until he hit the box cover. He pulled it down, recognized his friends Big Bird, Ernie and Bert, Oscar, Elmo, and Cookie Monster, and he sighed with relief. He then brought the box cover over to the ottoman and pointed to each of the characters lovingly. All was suddenly right with the world.

</p>

<p>
Austen, as you might have guessed, is a total Sesame Street addict. He now brings me the TiVo remote both in the morning and at bath time&#8212;basically whenever we're in the master bedroom for an extended period&#8212;and gestures for me to turn on Elmo. He knows that the TiVo remote in the living room (an older model that's a different size and color, but the same peanutty shape) does the same thing as the one in the bedroom, and he'll make the same "turn on Elmo!" gestures when he comes across it. He'll sometimes run to get his Elmo doll when Sesame Street comes on, so they can watch together. More often, he prefers to sit in my lap for at least a segment or two (he especially likes watching the Count reveal the Number of the Day this way, perhaps because I sing along as the Count serenades the Countess, or because I shout, "oh, the suspense is killing me!" when the Count plays the organ).
</p>

<p>
I loved Sesame Street when I was a kid, too, and I'm loving it now all over again. There are minor annoyances, of course&#8212;some of the human characters say their lines a little too exaggeratedly for me, and Baby Bear's baby voice and adult vocabulary used to unnerve me at first (though he's grown on me lately)&#8212;but mostly there's so much to enjoy and appreciate. Aside from the Count, I love the science experiments (seeing what items float or slide, playing the Grouch game "What Happens Next?"), Elmo's World ("it's Mr. Noodle's brother, Mr. Noodle!"), anything that happens in Gina the Vet's office, and the adventures of SUPer Grover. (I look forward to Journey to Ernie, but I wish that the segments were a little more consistent.)
</p>

<p>
This morning I got one of my favorite combinations: a scene in Gina's office that involved Grover. After watching for a few minutes, I realized that, skinny arms and blue fur aside, I AM GROVER. Whenever Grover gets something wrong, he says, "why did you not TELL me that this was so?", which my husband will tell you is exactly what I would do. It's not MY fault I got it wrong&#8212;in fact, I'm always right!&#8212;so it must be you. Good grief! Well, at least I don't have <s>Oscar's misanthropic attitude</s> <s>Elmo's self-centered worldview</s> <s>Bert's preference for reading over parties</s> Telly's obsession with triangles!

<h3 class="title">Courting Conservatives</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/politics/politicsspecial1/30alito.html?_r=1&th&emc=th" target="a8_win">This</a> makes my skin crawl and my heart ache. Oh, how those crafty conservatives must be doing a "you-liberals-think-you're-so-smart-but-WE-WIN!" dance right now, and justifiably so. I don't hate that they get to do that dance because they're conservatives; I hate it because they seem to take such ridiculous GLEE in chipping away at my personal freedoms.
</p>

<p>
I'm starting to realize how right <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/01/20/ivins.hillary/" target="a8_win">Molly Ivins</a> is when she complains about Democrats who try to walk the safe political line and thereby fail to take a stand on anything. OK, liberals (specifically Democrats in Congress): Enough caving. Enough compromising. Enough <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/27/politics/politicsspecial1/27alito.html?th&emc=th" target="a8_win">cringeing</a>. Decide what you stand for, what you believe, and then WORK TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. Do it out in the open, or take a page from the conservatives' book and plot, plan, and pull strings behind closed doors. Stop worrying that Republicans will make fun of you; it's time to stand up to that schoolyard bully and GET THINGS DONE.

<h3 class="title">Update Coming</h3>

<p>
Austen turns 14 months old today, but in the interest of being able to spend some quality time with my husband before we both collapse from exhaustion, I will be writing the update tomorrow. See you then.

<h3 class="title">Begin the Beguine</h3>

<p>
Avid fans of Sesame Street will recognize the title of this post as the line that the Count sings to the Countess after the number 14, which makes it appropriate for a summary of Austen's 14th month of being. (It's also, incidentally, the title of a Cole Porter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begin_the_Beguine" target="a8_win">song</a>.) 
</p>


<p>
This update is likely to be as much about me as about Austen, as this is the month I started working full-time again, under the best possible scenario: The team I worked on for almost 7 years when we lived in California had an opening right when I decided I wanted to work again. I get to work on a team I love, doing work I enjoy, creating a product I actually use (I'm using it right now, in fact)&#8212;and all from home, where I can take Austen breaks instead of coffee breaks.
It's taken a couple months to get all the paperwork processed, but that gave us time to sort out our nanny issues. I'm thrilled to say that after many frustrating weeks of combing <a href="http://philadelphia.craigslist.org/kid/" target="a8_win">craigslist</a> and being unable to find a good match for us, our current nanny decided to come on with us full-time. This is a good thing for me, of course, but it's also fantastic for Austen because Hannah and he have similar social-butterfly personalities. They're out right now playing with another nanny and her 16 month-old charge, in fact.
</p>

</p>
<p>
We also have Hannah to thank for the fact that Austen is now enrolled in a music class for toddlers; she did all the research, located a class near us, and called to see if we could come watch a sample class before deciding to enroll. I went to the first three or four classes, and they're really fun. We got a songbook and CD to play at home so Austen can become familiar with the songs, and now that he recognizes the tunes and the activities associated with them, he's TOTALLY INTO MUSIC CLASS. The great part is that even if I can't make it to any more classes, I can still sing and play with Austen in the evenings because I know the songs now, too.

In addition to the music and the activities&#8212;perhaps <em>more</em> than the music and the activities&#8212;Austen likes music class because it affords him the opportunity to hug and kiss other little kids. He's been hugging (and knocking down) other kids since before he could walk, and over the past month he's started trying to kiss them, too. He started by practicing on me a couple months ago, and once he got the hang of closing his mouth more and not probing with his tongue, he decided to spread the love around... which, now that I think of it, is probably why we've all been sick since Christmas. On Sunday he enountered an 8 or 9 year-old at the ice rink in Aston who crouched down and smiled at him, and Austen immediately moved in for the kiss. Unfortunately, the kid was wearing a skateboarding helmet on which Austen bonked his head every time he leaned in. Didn't stop him from trying five or six times before Al finally suggested to Austen that he give up.

After experimenting with a few different formats, we've settled into a regular routine around here now. Austen now gets a bath every night (unless we're out late) instead of every other night; Al gets in the tub with him and then takes a shower while I put Austen's jammies on. We watch a little Sesame Street together, and then between 7 and 8pm I say, &quot;ready for bed?&quot; Austen lifts his arms up in the &quot;pick me up!&quot; gesture, I say &quot;kiss Daddy good night!&quot;, Austen kisses Daddy, and I take him upstairs. On go the HEPA filter and the humidifier, and then I carry Austen around the room while singing a series of standards and lullabies. The last tune is always the classic lullaby, though I vary the lyrics from night to night. I've settled on these two verses at a minimum, however:
</p>
<p>
Lullaby, and good night<br />
In your crib you'll be sleeping<br />
With your eyes closed, fast asleep<br />
We'll be here when you wake up<br />
<br />
Close your eyes, little bean<br />
We'll be here in the morn<br />
Sleep 'til seven or eight<br />
And we'll come get you then.
</p>
<p>
The whole put-down routine takes from five to fifteen minutes, depending how ready for sleep (and how snarffly) Austen is. If he's especially resistent, I sing more animated songs first and then work my way to the slower ones. 
</p>
<p>
Despite the admonishment to sleep until 7 or 8, Austen's up between 6 and 6:30 most mornings. Al gets up with him, plays with him down in the basement, and feeds him breakfast while I sleep a while longer ('til 7:45 most mornings, 7 on Mondays) and then get dressed. We trade off at around 8 or 8:15, and Al gets ready for work while I get Austen dressed. (Mondays are a little trickier, because Hannah comes at 8 instead of 9.) So far it's working really well for us, though I'm sure Al could use more sleep than he's currently getting. He much prefers getting up with Austen to putting him down, however, so I think the division of labor suits us.
</p>
<p>
Austen seems to be adapting fairly well to the fact that I'm working and that Hannah is here more often, although I think he's a little sad that he doesn't get at least one day alone with me during the week. The other day I held him while Hannah got her coat on in preparation for taking Austen out in the stroller, and Austen waved bye-bye at her. I said, &quot;oh no, honey, she's not leaving yet. You're going out together.&quot; He waved again, more firmly this time, and both Hannah's and my hearts broke a little. He couldn't have been saying, &quot;Mommy's here now, you can go&quot; more clearly. I was secretly glad when we had an uncovered childcare day last week (Hannah wasn't full-time yet, and the temporary nanny got sick), so Austen and I could spend the day together running errands. I'm also making sure that I get down on the floor and play with him whenever I'm not working.

Of course, that means there's no time for chores. Obviously weekday baking has fallen by the wayside (though I can sometimes squeeze in a batch of muffins on the weekends), and the laundry tends to pile up now. I <em>have</em> figured out how to incorporate Austen into a couple chores, however; it started with stirring pots on the stove, and then progressed to unloading the dishwasher (perhaps because he realized that's where his beloved spatulas come from). I do all the dishes and glasses, and Austen unloads the silverware. He started by handing me one knife or fork or spoon at a time, which I would put away in the drawer while saying, &quot;thank you!&quot;, but the other day he carried several spoons in a row to the drawer and tossed them in himself.

<p>
Austen also likes it when I vacuum, though the appeal of the vacuum cleaner is the exhaust that blows out the front&#8212;which means he's constantly standing right where I need to vacuum. We've worked out a game where I chase him around with the vacuum cleaner, and in this way he gets his hair blown back as desired, and I eventually get the whole room cleaned.
