<h3 class="title">6.50</h3>

<p>
I had a dream last night that the plan to hire me back full-time at my old company had been delayed, and that in the meantime I was going to contract for them. My boss' boss asked me what I proposed for an hourly rate. After doing some quick math in my head that involved my old salary*, I came up with $6.50 an hour.
</p>


<p>
It was only after I got my first paycheck and saw how small it was that I realized I'd made a mistake with the decimal point&#8212;I should have proposed $65 an hour, not $6.50! This stupid math error haunted the rest of my dreams, even after my fast-asleep mind moved on to unrelated topics. How was I going to pay the babysitter on only $6.50 an hour? How was I going to support my family?  The undercurrent of "6.50... 6.50... 6.50" kept niggling at me until it finally woke me up.
</p>

<p>
*Neither $6.50 or $65 have any relation to my old salary. Obviously my sleep mind can't do math.
