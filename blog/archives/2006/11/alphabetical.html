<h3 class="title">Alphabetical</h3>

<p>
I know I'm totally getting ahead of myself here&#8212;I haven't even written the 23-month update yet&#8212;but I have to write this down before I forget that it happened today. In the car on the way back from King of Pizza tonight, The Beaner said the entire alphabet all at once.
</p>
<p>
He's been saying it in segments for a couple weeks now&#8212;singing it, really&#8212;starting mostly at Q or S and then singing "now I know ABC next time sing w' me" after he hit Z. Tonight, however, he sang it like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
A B C D E F G<br />
H I J K ELMO P<br />
Q R S <br />
T U V<br />
W X<br />
Y and Z<br />
Now I know ma ABC,<br />
next time wonchu sing wit me.
</blockquote>

<p>
That "ELMO" in the middle is what I was trying to prevent by enunciating carefully in the middle of every alphabet song I ever sang to The Beaner. Big Bird and Zoe and rest of the gang on Sesame Street&#8212;not to mention the singing ride-on toy my parents got him for his first birthday&#8212;have been undermining me, however, by pronouncing "L M N O" as "elemeno" when they say the alphabet. I found I didn't mind so much, though, when I heard my Beaner sing it all by himself tonight. ELMO P is fine by me.
