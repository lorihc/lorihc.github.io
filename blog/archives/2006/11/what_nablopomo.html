I was going to save a post on this topic for the last day of November, but as that is also the day The Beaner turns two years old, I'm sure I'll have the 24 month update/two year update (and possibly other things) to write about then. It also happens that today one of my work colleagues forwarded an article on <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/participation_inequality.html">Participation Inequality</a> by Jakob Neilsen that included the following tidbit:

There are about <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/internet_growth.html" title="Alertbox: One Billion Internet Users (note: the number has grown by 100 million since this article was written)">1.1 billion Internet users</a>, yet <strong>only 55 million users (5%) have weblogs</strong> according to Technorati. Worse, there are only <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000436.html" title="David Sifry: State of the Blogosphere, August 2006">1.6 million postings per day</a>; because some people post multiple times per day, <strong>only 0.1% of users post daily</strong>.

<p>
This bit seemed relevant to NaBloPoMo, which is all about posting daily. I wonder if we will throw off Technorati's numbers for November? I also wonder: <em>Should</em> we all be posting daily? I used the NaBloPoMo Randomizer to scan through the blogs of 10-20 NaBloPoMo participants a day, and for every gem I found, I found another 10 or so blogs that were Not For Me. Some just didn't cover a subject I was interested in reading about (religion, for example, or Everything You Never Wanted to Know About the Author's Nose Hair, for another), some were personal journals that I had trouble empathizing with, and others just didn't seem to have anything to say. (I have a years' worth of paper journals from my time as a shiftless temp worker in Washington, D.C. filled with similar ramblings... or rather, I did have; I think I burned them a while ago.) My overall impression: Many of us would benefit from having a couple days to mull things over and form coherent thoughts; forced daily postings for those of us in this category generally equals many posts of low quality that are more likely to discourage new readers than attract them.

<p>
One of the things that became obvious to me about halfway through the month is that I had plenty of things to write about. The main reason I don't post daily every month is that I don't have the time to develop each topic into a full-blown blog post. It's happened to me a few times this month: I wanted to write about something, but I didn't have the energy or time to do so, so I wrote a small "I'll write about it later" post to remain in compliance with NaBloPoMo. For every going-through-the-motions post, however, there was at least one other post that I probably wouldn't have gotten around to writing had it not been for NaBloPoMo (the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/11/toddler_time.html">Toddler Time</a> post is a good example). Since I often process what's going on around me by writing about it (see six years of <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">hockey blogging</a>, not to mention many of the entries here on avocado8, for evidence of this), the prompt to write daily has been extremely useful in what's turned out to be a difficult month of parenting. (I would rather have skipped the days when I did not have enough time to devote to the subject I really wanted to write about, however.)
