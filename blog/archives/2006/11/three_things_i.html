<h3 class="title">Three Things I Learned Today</h3>

<p>
We celebrated The Beaner's 2nd birthday with both sets of grandparents today. I'll have photos to post tomorrow (both of the cake eating/present opening and of other events of the past few days&#8212;I brought my work computer with me to my in-laws', and I can't download photos with it). In the meantime, I'll mention three things that occurred to me today:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Despite tales of terrible twos and willful guff, I have an awesome child.</li>
<li>I want to spend as much time with The Beaner as possible.</li>
<li>I want to spend a few days with my parents at Christmas, mainly to share the joy that is The Beaner with them.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now that we're back in our own house, I'd like to go spend some quality quiet time with my husband. More news tomorrow.
