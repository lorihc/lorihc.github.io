<h3 class="title">Back From the Big City</h3>

<p>
We're back from NYC; I only wish I had enough energy to write about what we did. Our dinner at Nobu was excellent (and I have been craving lychee martinis ever since), we got to SEE A MOVIE sans kid, I finally got a chance to wear my black suede boots, and The Beaner had an awesome time with his grandmother and great aunt.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow I'll write about what we ate at Nobu (I took photos of everything, but I'm not sure they captured the dishes very well&#8212;a point-and-shoot in macro mode with a flash in low light is less than ideal for capturing the beauty of well-plated yellowtail sashimi with jalape&ntilde;o), and if I have time I'll also add my thoughts on the new Bond movie.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, here's a self-portrait of us taken on 34th Street between 8th and 9th, I think.
