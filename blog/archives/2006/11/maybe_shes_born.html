<h3 class="title">Maybe She's Born With It</h3>

<p>
As I suspected would happen, I'm actually finding it harder to blog on the weekend, when I theoretically have no other obligations, than I do during the work week, when I'm supposed to be, well, working. I can think of plenty of things to write about on the weekends, but finding the time to actually write about them is difficult because I'm on parent duty, and I don't want to be too selfish with my personal time. I already take advantage of Al's goodwill by baking, cleaning, reading, or running quick errands whenever I can on weekends. At the moment we're all in the basement, watching Kipper the Dog and other PBS Kids Sprout shows On Demand while The Beaner plays at our feet. Earlier today we walked to Reading Terminal Market and then did some shopping on Walnut Street together; while we walked, I composed the review of my new Fuji Finepix F30 in my head and discussed the outline of it with Al. I hope to get that written up tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Today my post is about makeup. Because before we left for our walk this morning, I was standing in the bathroom, looking at the array of beauty products jumbled on the counter and wondering if anyone would care which products I used. Two things were running through my head simultaneously: (1) Such a topic sounds more like a LiveJournal meme than one of the writing prompts in <a href="http://mightygirl.net/shop">Maggie's book</a> (which I admit I've only read bits of; after this idea, it'd probably be a good thing if I won a copy of Maggie's book for participating in <a href="http://www.fussy.org/nablopomo.html">NaBloPoMo</a>, and if I don't, I'm going to buy one myself), and (2) I wonder if anyone would still say &quot;<a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/07/wardrobe_change.html">albino&#8212;needs to wear makeup or something</a>&quot; when I *am* wearing makeup, as happened to me in 11th grade.
</p>
<p>
So, without further ado, here's what's on my bathroom counter. What's on yours?
</p>
<p class="pictureP">

</p>
<p style="margin-right: 13%;margin-left: 15%;">
<strong>1. </strong>L'OREAL Visible Lift foundation in Soft Ivory (102).<br />
<strong>2. </strong>Tea tree oil from Trader Joe's (used on zits).<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Shiseido eye pencil in purple. I've been using this pencil (well, not this exact one; I've obviously bought replacements every couple years) since my mom got one for me for my birthday when I was in 8th grade.<br />
<strong>4. </strong>No-name brand eyelash curler. Should have stuck with Revlon.<br />
<strong>5. </strong>Neutrogena Rapid Clear salicylic acid acne treatment. I hate the smell of this stuff, but it's effective. Neutrogena stopped making the similarly-formulated but fragrance-free&#8212;and much larger&#8212;Clear Pore gel I used to use, and I'm allergic to benzoyl peroxide, so my options are limited. It royally pisses me off that I still get zits at age 38, especially with combination normal/dry skin.<br />
<strong>6. </strong>No-name large brush for dusting off extra loose powder.<br />
<strong>7. </strong>Neutrogena Skinclearing oil-free concealer. Another zit-fighter. It works to conceal zits for a couple days, and then my skin dries out so badly that it peels, and I'm left with a red mark that I can't quite cover up properly (though I try with #17).<br />
<strong>8. </strong>Maybelline Expertwear eyeshadow in Crown Jewels. I wear eyeshadow probably 4 or 5 days a week; this is my choice about 60% of the time.<br />
<strong>9. </strong>Maybelline Expertwear eyeshadow in Vanilla. I got this when I saw Carmandy on What Not to Wear repeatedly recommend brushing a sparkly white shadow just under your eyebrows and around your tear ducts to &quot;really open your eyes&quot;. I almost never use it. I use the tray of Champagne shadow that's in #21 more often, usually on days when I don't feel like doing my eyes up nicely but don't want to look tired.<br />
<strong>10. </strong>Maybelline Expertwear eyeshadow in Almond Truffles. This is the neutral shadow I wear 40% of the time that I do up my eyes nicely.<br />
<strong>11. </strong>Trish McEvoy Sheer Blush 3 from 11 or 12 years ago. My friend Stacia Lynds was a makeup artist working for Trish McEvoy back when we both lived in the Washington, DC area, and I happened to stop in to Nordstrom one day after work when she was there doing makeovers. There was a lull in the foot traffic because it was dinner time, so she asked if she could do me. I said yes. When she was finished I wanted to buy something because she'd spent so much time on my face, so I got the blush she'd used. I wasn't convinced it was the right color for me, however, so I didn't start using it until about 2002, as an experiment. (I'd pretty much gone blushless since high school because everything I tried looked garish on me.) The first day I wore it, two women at work asked me if I'd lost weight because my face looked thinner. I was a devotee from that day forward. As you can see if you look closely, however, it's almost gone.<br />
<strong>12. </strong>Trish McEvoy blush in Pick Me Up, bought about a month ago to replace the depleting Sheer Blush 3... which sadly (though not surprisingly), Trish doesn't make anymore. Pick Me Up is a little less sheer and a bit pinker, but Al says it looks great on me&#8212;very natural.<br />
<strong>13. </strong>Revlon powder brush, used to apply blush.<br />
<strong>14. </strong>Maybelline Great Lash mascara in Soft Black. I wear this non-waterproof mascara every few days, whenever I think it's unlikely that I'll cry, get wet, or play hockey.<br />
<strong>15. </strong>Maybelline Great Lash waterproof mascara in Soft Black. My standard mascara; it's pretty bulletproof, which also means it  doesn't come off all the way every night, and tends to accumulate. Hence the application of the non-waterproof variety, or no mascara at all, every few days.<br />
<strong>16. </strong>L'OREAL Translucide loose powder in Translucent (956).<br />
<strong>17. </strong>Almay Kinetin undereye concealer, used on zits when #7 causes major peeling. I never use it under my eyes.<br />
<strong>18. </strong>d:fi pliable molding cream (for my hair). Technically not makeup, I know, but if my husband ever uses this list to determine which items to pack for a surprise weekend away, I want him to include the d:fi. <br />
<strong>19. </strong>Cover Girl eye pencil in Midnight Black. Used when I'm not feeling the purple, or when I'm really angry. (I tend to go heavy on the eye makeup when I'm angry.)<br />
<strong>20. </strong>Neutrogena Active Copper 20 SPF moisturizer. On days when I'm too lazy to bother with applying foundation, I'll just mix a bit of foundation in with my moisturizer and distribute as evenly as possible.<br />
<strong>21. </strong>My makeup travel bag (a quart size Ziploc freezer bag). It's currently holding a small jar of foundation, a small jar of powder, a small Clinique sample jar into which I've put some Neutrogena Active Copper night cream, the Champagne eyeshadow, and a bottle of Optcon allergy eyedrops (never leave home without 'em). 
</p>
<p style="margin-right: 13%;margin-left: 15%;">
<strong>Not pictured: </strong>What I take all this crap off with; namely, Olay makeup-removing towelettes and a homemade version of Neutrogena's discontinued alcohol-free toner (I'm allergic to the fragrance in the line that replaced it). My version of the toner is witch hazel with some glycerin, some tea tree oil, a drop of peppermint oil, a drop of rosemary oil, and in winter, a bit of olive oil.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Edited to add: </strong>I don't carry a bit of this stuff in my purse, btw. I apply my makeup in the morning and then forget about it. The only makeup-related items you'll find in my purse or pocket are a Natural Ice Original Flavor SPF 15 lip balm and, if I'm going somewhere fancy, a Neutrogena lip gloss in Coy. (I actually have a lip balm in a pocket of every jacket, vest, purse, or bag I own. There's also one in the kitchen, on my desk, in my nightstand, and in the car. I can't live without it.)

<p>I don't wear makeup often enough to have much out on the counter.</p>

<p>However, I do have two makeup brushes living in the toothbrush holder.</p>

<p>Oh, wait.  One's a makeup brush (a sponge-tipped one for eyeshadow), and one's an actual paintbrush.</p>

<p>I've got a bunch of stuff in the medicine cabinet, though, and more in a drawer.  Including a three-year-old Stila lip gloss compact with four shades of excellent, emollient gloss.  Alas, I've lost the wee brushie that came with it, so I have to apply it with my fingers.  Which I hate to do.  So I rarely wear it.  Which is okay, because it's three years old, and I should throw it out already.  But I can't ever bring myself to do that, because it's such excellent, emollient gloss.</p>

<p>I'm a sad, sad woman.</p>

<p>You are a normal, normal woman. I still have a Dior eyeshadow that my roommate Pat gave me in 1993 because it didn't suit her. I can't bring myself to throw it away because it's the best eyeshadow I've ever owned (and its vibrant teal, purple, and blue are useful for when I need to apply Angry Eyes).</p>
