<h3 class="title">A Variation on Ratphooey Pumpkin Muffins</h3>

<p>
I have another post for today in the works, but right now I'm eating an *awesome* pumpkin chocolate muffin, and I have to share the recipe. It's based on the one <a href="http://ratphooey.livejournal.com/729702.html">Ratphooey posted in October</a>, which in turn was based on a Bon Appetit recipe from 1995. I tried the recipe once before, and it came out OK, but I made some notes about adjustments I wanted to make. This time I made them according to my notes&#8212;and I also ran out of whole wheat flour. Here's what I did:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ratphooey Pumpkin-Chocolate Muffins #2</strong>
</p>

<p>
2 cups + 1 tablesppon sugar<br />
2/3 cup grapeseed oil<br />
3 large eggs<br />
1 15-oz can of organic pumpkin from Trader Joe's<br />
1 large spoonful of mashed butternut squash, left over from Thanksgiving<br />
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour<br />
1/2 cup all purpose flour<br />
1 heaping teaspoon ground cloves<br />
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br />
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br />
dash ground ginger<br />
dash ground allspice<br />
1 teaspoon baking soda<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br />
1/3 cup golden flaxseed meal<br />
1/4 - 1/3 bag semi-sweet chocolate chunks (or chips)
</p>

<p>
Preheat oven to 350&deg;F. Beat sugar and oil in large bowl to blend. Mix in eggs, pumpkin, and butternut squash. Mix flour, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, baking soda, salt, baking powder, and flaxseed meal in another large bowl with a wire whisk. Stir into pumpkin mixture in 2 additions. Mix in chocolate.
</p>

<p>
Fill 12 panettone cups with batter and place on a cookie sheet. Bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 25-35 minutes (I think mine took 34 or 35). Transfer to racks to cool.
</p>

<p>
Serving suggestion: Slice in half and plaster with mascarpone. YUM!
</p>
