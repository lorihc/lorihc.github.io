<h3 class="title">NaBloPoMo</h3>

<p>
Ok, don't laugh, but I've finally signed up to participate in <a href="http://www.fussy.org/nablopomo.html" target="a8_win">NaBloPoMo</a> (nothing like waiting until the last minute, eh?). The reason I procrastinated for so long is that I wasn't sure I'd really be able to keep up the pace of 1 blog entry per day. Well, actually, that's not quite right. What I'm most worried about is being able to post every day here on avocado8 while also posting at least weekly on my <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">hockey blog</a> (I'm playing for a local women's team this season) *and* keeping my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/">Flickr photostream</a> up to date. Oh, yeah, and doing the job I'm paid to do during the day.
</p>
<p>
See? I'm already feeling overwhelmed again. The good news is that through <a href="http://www.fussy.org/2006/10/rules-prizes.html">Mrs. Kennedy's blog post about NaBloPoMo</a>, I discovered <a href="http://www.w98.us/ekd/archives/132">dinky</a>, who psyched herself up for a month of posting by formulating a plan&#8212;an editorial calendar, if you will. (Hmmm, seems to me that I mentioned months ago that I needed an editorial calendar, didn't I?) Well, here's my plan:
</p>

<ol>
<li>This post right here (it counts!)</li>
<li>Halloween</li>
<li>The Beaner's 3-days-overdue 23-month update.</li>
<li>That post about The Devil Wears Prada that I keep meaning to write.</li>
<li>A review of my new Fujifilm FinePix F30</li>
<li>Recipe of the week [I love this idea, because it can be repeated at least 4 times!]</li>
<li>Election day rants and endorsements</li>
<li>Book review of whatever was most interesting among my recent readings.</li>
<li>A review of a Philadelphia restaurant, park, or attraction.</li>
<li>Funny photo with caption/story.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>

<p>
This does not bode well.

<p>I'd like to see a post on your new camera as I'm also thinking of getting a small camera to stick in the diaper bag when I don't want to carry around the digital rebel. Other suggestions - posts on cooking/baking with recipies or book/movie reviews. </p>

<p>Great suggestions, Heidi! I've added them to the list (I definitely had in mind that I wanted to write about the Finepix, so thanks for the reminder). Anyone else?</p>

<p>I loved your post in reaction to the "buy pink" fad. Also, Philly stuff is always of interest to me.</p>
