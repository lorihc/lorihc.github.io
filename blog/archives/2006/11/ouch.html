<h3 class="title">Ouch</h3>

<p>
President Bush's press conference just started. Listening to him speak is like chewing hot food on the back left molar that desperately needs a root canal.

<p>True. On the other hand, I caught him actually correcting his own grammar--he said something like "the [Baker Hamilton] group are going to--is going to have recommendations".</p>

<p>Also, I thought overall he was properly conciliatory. Whether he'll actually act reasonably is, of course, doubtful.</p>

<p>It's his folksy-belligerent speaking style that makes me wince. And did you catch him telling a reporter that he lied when he told said reporter that Rumsfeld would be staying? I definitely heard that grammar correction, but I also heard a lot more self-correction (or rather, self-contradiction -- "the reason I did that was [what sounded like an honest an overly candid reason]..." followed by "but I also did it because [scripted reason, which contradicted/conflicted with first reason]"). It was just weird.</p>

<p>I also noted, btw, the difference between this speech and the post-election/inaugural (can't remember which) address he gave a few years ago. In that prior one, he claimed a mandate he didn't have, and did not speak of compromise and common ground -- he only spoke of working with Democrats who agreed with him. This one was much more about working together, and he used the term "common ground" a couple times. Not sure what to make of it; just noticed, is all.</p>

<p>Yup, he sounded very defensive in this press conference.  I actually thought he was being pretty candid when discussing the Rumsfeld resignation; not having listened to many prior press conferences where he took questions directly, I don't know whether this was unusual, but to me it signalled that he knows his style has to change a little.</p>

<p>That's what I meant: he was being shockingly candid on the one hand, and then remembering the script on the other. It was very strange indeed. :)<br />
