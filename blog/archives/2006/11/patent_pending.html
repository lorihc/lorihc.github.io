<p>
I just got word that the patent my colleague and I submitted for some work we did recently has been filed with the U.S. Patent Office. It'll probably be 2-3 years before it's approved or rejected, but in the meantime, I HAVE A PATENT PENDING. How cool is that?

<p>It'll probably (if it's computery) be 3 years before the first response of any kind, but longer still until it issues.  However, in most cases (this is a decision that was made by whomever filed it, usually the decision is to publish) it will be published in 18 months, so you'll pop up in the database then.  Yay, progress of science and the useful arts!</p>
