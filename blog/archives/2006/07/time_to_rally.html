<h3 class="title">Time to Rally</h3>

<p>
I rallied for a little bit during the Q &amp; A part of the podcast session to chat with Mrs. Kennedy about ice hockey and haircuts and our living/working arrangements, but now I'm taking a break in my room. I'm hoping that Al and Austen get back from the King of Pizza in the next 10 minutes, so I'll have time to video chat with them before going to the Design/Style/Customization session at 5:15.
</p>
<p>
 I'm also hoping that this little break will get me psyched for more schmoozing. If only I could nap and video chat at the same time! Actually, I probably could; all I'd have to do is leave the laptop on and let Austen watch me sleep. Of course, then I wouldn't see him.... Well, fart. 
</p>

<p>
By the way, I'm tagging all my BlogHer photos with both blogher and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/blogher06/">blogher06</a>, so if you search by tag you'll see the latest. The last couple sessions were fairly dimly lit, so I didn't get much worth seeing, but hopefully&#8212;if I rally successfully&#8212;I'll get some shots from the cocktail party by the pool.
