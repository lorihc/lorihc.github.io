<p>
I don't know how I'm going to make it to the cocktail party. I've spoken to about a dozen women so far (I know, I know&#8212;I haven't even made a dent, given that there are about 750 women here), and I'm already running out of steam. <a href="http://www.fussy.org/">Mrs. Kennedy</a> is sitting here with me now, listening to the podcasting presentation, but we're both mostly blogging and having a bit of quiet time. I'm finding that I don't want to have to think about things to say anymore.

<p>I reached my real limit about 10 minutes after I got there! Man, it was intense to talk with so many people.  I wish I'd gotten to hang out with you some in a quiet hangy-outy way!</p>

<p>Intense is a good word for it. I'd love to talk to you more, especially since I have a feeling we've met before -- maybe in the late 90s? In any case, I'm sure our paths will cross again.</p>
