<h3 class="title">Wardrobe Change</h3>

<p>
I almost got all freaked out over possibly being the worst-dressed person at BlogHer (you mean my purple Adidas sneakers are too schleppy? a fitted t-shirt from REI is too casual?), but you know what? I'm not going to suddenly get a fabulous wardrobe in the next 5 hours, and I refuse to pack 5 pairs of shoes and every Prada shirt that Al's brother ever handed down to me just in case. (I'm already packing my walking sneakers and my Keen mary janes and wearing the aforementioned Adidas&#8212;or perhaps packing the Adidas and wearing the mary janes for airport security purposes&#8212;because I can't function without my morning walk, and the Adidas sneakers are more for moseying than for serious exercise-walking.)
</p>
<p>
I'm a frickin' jeans-and-t-shirt-wearing software engineer/mommy blogger, damn it. And I'm packing light!*
</p>

<p style="font-size:smaller;">
*Well, light for me. Backpack with two laptops, camera, and snacks plus carryon with various chargers, a few articles of clothing, two pairs of shoes, toiletries, meds, and makeup (DUDE! I wear makeup 9 days out of 10, even though I work at home, and this weekend I'll be OUT IN PUBLIC).

<p>From what pictures I've seen, you dress pretty cool looking to me. ;-)  Comfort is the way to go.</p>

<p>I hear you on the makeup.  I wear it probably 364 days a year even when I am gonna be home.  I am so fair that I look completely washed out without it. Yikes.</p>

<p>Thanks, Gail! I'm with you on being so fair I'd practically disappear without makeup. While we're on that subject, want to hear a story? When I was in 11th grade I took a sociology class, and once a quarter we'd spend an entire period passing around pieces of paper with our names on it every 2 minutes or so. IOW, you'd start by writing your name on a sheet of paper, and then pass it to the next person. They'd write something about you on the paper, and pass it on. Eventually the paper with your name on it would get back to you, and you could see what everyone thought of you. One time I my piece of paper said, "Albino -- needs to wear makeup or something." And I happened to be wearing full makeup that day!</p>

<p>That was cold-blooded!  That comment must have stung, given that you were wearing makeup.  Long before I started wearing makeup, I got kidded for having red hair, freckles, glasses and being a bit pudgy (I guess adding to those facts that I looked washed out didn't help).  </p>

<p>Good thing I have never been kidded about wearing makeup when I play hockey!!</p>
