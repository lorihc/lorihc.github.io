<h3 class="title">19 Months</h3>

<p>
My friend Jean, who has a daughter three months older than Austen, and I were talking recently about how much fun our kids have become as they've gotten older. <a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/001707.html">Matthew Baldwin</a> described this stage as going from pet to person, and I think that's about right. It's a battle of wills sometimes (especially now that Austen has a very clear will and is not shy about exerting it), but the fact that he understands so much more means he can enjoy so much more&#8212;and we can enjoy him.
</p>


<p class="pictureP"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/173604035/" title="Photo Sharing" class="special"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/61/173604035_4106023b2d.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="cool, daddy-o" /></a>
</p>
<p>
The only problems arise when we take him out in public, especially to a venue that isn't particularly kid-oriented. We got a taste of this when we brought him out to dinner with us at the new Goji Japanese restaurant up on Hamilton between 20th and 21st. We loved the food&#8212;and so did he!&#8212;but for most of the meal he refused to sit in his high chair, he squealed loudly (too loudly for the subdued venue) in both excitement and dismay, and he dumped about 12 ounces of orange juice all over me and himself. It wasn't until we were out with my friend Valerie yesterday, however, and I saw her look of slight exasperation at having to move at toddler speed (and according to toddler whims) that I realized that this is the age where Austen's becoming more fun for us and more annoying for everyone else. (Both Al and Val laughed and agreed this was probably true.)

</p>
<p>
As for developments this month, there were so many that I'm not sure I'm remembering them all. Here are the highlights: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Austenglish</strong><br />
I think I've mentioned before that Austen <em>can</em> enunciate&#8212;we've heard him say &quot;go down stairs&quot;, &quot;shoes&quot;, &quot;hot dog&quot;, and other words and phrases really clearly once or twice&#8212;but most of the time he sounds like he's trying to invent a language with as few letters as possible. I don't know whether Al and I mumble and he's learning by example, or whether he's just lazy, but once he learns a word, he immediately sets about shortening it. A few of the words in Austen's vocabulary:
</p>
<div class="listTable">
<table>
<tr>
<th>Austenglish</th>
<th>English</th>
<th>Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>klopelope</td>
<td>cantaloupe</td>
<td>sometimes shortened to just &quot;lope&quot; </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>yoo</td>
<td>shoe</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>llor</td>
<td>stroller</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>bapba</td>
<td>grandpa, grandma </td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tyacha</td>
<td>cherry</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dit-dit</td>
<td>cookie</td>
<td>*see below for what Al and I call them</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>boofboo</td>
<td>blueberries</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dat dyoo </td>
<td>thank you </td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mo</td>
<td>more</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>go</td>
<td>car</td>
<td>no matter how many times we say &quot;car&quot;, Austen still calls it a &quot;go&quot; </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mama</td>
<td>milk </td>
<td>I find this association interesting </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>whoa</td>
<td>horse</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>choo-choo</td>
<td>train</td>
<td>also used for toy cars and toy buses </td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>
Among the words he says clearly are &quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;,  &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;hi!&quot; and &quot;bye!&quot;, and he points out every cat, dog, horse,  cow, train, and bus he sees. (He's been seeing quite a lot of trains lately, too, as Hannah's been taking him to 30th Street station to watch the commuter trains come in.) He also enjoys chatting with other kids, especially older kids. He often approaches groups of teenagers and just starts gabbling away, and his body language says, &quot;hey, yeah, I'm one of y'all. Let's hang!&quot; He'll lean against a wall or a railing if one is handy, trying to look casual.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Voldemort in the pantry</strong><br />
One of the words in Austen's vocabulary is so loaded that we try to avoid saying it around him at all. That word is &quot;cookie&quot;, and it can make him forget any other word he knows (except &quot;YAY!&quot;), including &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot;. I made the mistake of buying Earth's Best Organic Letter of the Day Cookies (in the convenient 4-pack) 
at Costco after he recognized the box and started pointing and saying &quot;dit-dit! dit-dit!&quot; frantically. (He learned about these cookies at Mira's house last month.) On the plus side, the cookies are small and not too sweet, so I can give him two or three at a time without feeling too guilty (a serving size is  9, believe it or not). On the minus side, no matter how many cookies I give him, he always throws a fit when I tell him he can't have any more. 
</p>
<p class="pictureP">

</p>
<p>
I've taken to calling cookies &quot;those which must not be named&quot;; Al has no patience for that many words (suddenly where Austen gets it from is becoming clear...) and just calls them Voldemorts. I'm trying to stick to &quot;those which must not be named,&quot; as I think it'll take longer for him to catch on to what we're talking about. I'm debating about whether to just throw them out before they work any more dark magic on my kid.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Table for one </strong><br />
We have no idea how much Austen weighs, nor do we know how tall he is, but he's obviously growing. He moved  to size 5 Huggies this month after about a week of leaking through every size 4 diaper we put on him. He's definitely sturdy, and with the size 5 diapers on, he just barely squeezes in behind the post in his high chair. We had planned on getting him a booster seat and giving the high chair away, but before we could find a booster we liked, we spent a weekend at my parents' house, where my mom set up a little wicker chair and table for him. Austen LOVED this arrangement, so when we got home we put our matching wicker chair in front of the cherry table that came with our couch, and he's been eating his meals there ever since.
</p>
<p class="pictureP">

</p>
<p>
Also on the food front, Austen learned how to use a fork this month. It's now his favorite utensil. He still eats just about everything, from chicken satay and turkey jerky to cantaloupe (his new favorite fruit) and clam pizza, but he's decided he no longer likes cottage cheese.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Veto power</strong><br />
Austen has very definite opinions about what constitutes good music, and like most teenagers, he will listen to a song ad nauseum for a while before deciding that it totally sucks. I've been trying to broaden his musical horizons a bit by introducing him to some of my favorite songs in between his Music Class tunes, but most haven't stuck. When we're in the car he routinely vetoes   a selection with  &quot;no, no, no!&quot; while pointing a finger imperiously at the radio. If we don't act quickly enough to advance to the next song, he can become hysterical. Also, even though he's been listening to iTunes on the Mac since he was tiny tiny tiny, he now associates listening to the music he likes with riding in the car. He'll often point to the garage door and shout &quot;GO! GO!&quot; to let us know that he'd like to go out to the car and listen to music.
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<img src="/blog/images/parenthood/summer2006/veto_power.jpg" alt="veto power" width="333" height="499" class="special" />
</p>
<p>
<strong>New nap routine</strong><br />
Thanks to the two-week stint at Mira's house&#8212;during which it wasn't feasible for Austen to sleep in the stroller&#8212;Austen has finally learned how to have a normal naptime. After lunch each day, Hannah removes his shoes and shorts and changes his diaper, and then she puts him down on a soft blanket in the basement playroom. She tells him it's naptime, and she waits. He'll usually talk to himself or flibble his lips for a few minutes, and then he'll conk out. It's the bedtime/naptime routine we'd always heard about, but never experienced ourselves. Now, if it would only work at bedtime.... (Actually, it almost does; I usually sing and snuggle Austen because I like the bonding time, not because it's absolutely required. When I tell him it's time to go to sleep now, he's usually out within 5 minutes.) 
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/179960850/" title="Photo Sharing" class="special"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/67/179960850_39e2eba999.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="nap time" /></a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who's number one?</strong><br />
One night when we were giving Austen a bath, he threw one of his toys in the water, splashing both of us, and then threw his hands over his head and pointed to the sky in an unmistakable gesture of victory. I tried to scold him for the toy throwing, but Al couldn't stop laughing. He went, &quot;who's number one?&quot;, and Austen responded by repeating the gesture and sticking his tongue out, Ozzy Osbourne-style. We were like, where the hell did he get <em>that</em> from? It occurred to me later that it was probably from watching World Cup soccer with Hannah, an idea that was confirmed by Hannah when she came the next day.  
</p>
<p>
Ever since that bath, all we have to do is say &quot;number one&quot;, and Austen shoots a finger into the air. He'll even do it when the context is wrong (as when I was relating a story to Al the other day, and I finished the first point with, &quot;so the fact that she even considered it is number one&quot;).
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/180001925/" title="Photo Sharing" class="special"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/63/180001925_ef48986795.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="number one" /></a>
</p>
<p>
There's probably more that I'm forgetting, like the fact that Austen seems to have all his teeth now (though not all of them are in all the way), and the fact that though he likes all of his grandparents, he's partial to his grandfathers, but I don't want to keep this blog entry from getting posted any longer. As Austen would say, &quot;bye bye, blog post!&quot;

<h3 class="title">From Away to Down East and Back Again</h3>

<p>
Al, Austen, and I just returned from a lovely road trip to Maine. We took our time (a trick I learned when Austen and I traveled alone to Maine in November), spending a night in Springfield, Mass on the way up and one in Norwood, Mass (near my best friend Sandra's place in Canton) on the way back.
</p>

<p>
We watched a bunch of Red Sox games ("behball" is now part of Austen's vocabulary) on NESN, got to spend some quality time with <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~vbg/blog/">Val</a>, ate great seafood, walked the Eastern Prom Trail, hiked on Mackworth Island, rode in a narrow gauge railroad car, visited two lighthouses, explored the Old Port, and still had plenty of time for naps and relaxing and swimming in the hotel pools. Oh! And on our first night in Maine, Val and Matthew cooked us an awesome dinner of grilled salmon, dilly beans, amazing potato salad, shrimp and brown rice pasta salad, and a really neat coconut milk ice cream. I have already bought some brown rice pasta so I can try out the shrimp salad at home (it was a simple preparation with a bit of sesame oil and garlic oil), and I need to get Val to send me the potato salad and dilly bean recipes. (Al was dreaming about the potato salad on the way home.)
</p>

</p>

<p>
A few photos from our trip are up on Flickr now, but I still have a bunch more to post, so stay tuned. I'm already missing Val (and probably will even more when I head out for my morning walk alone tomorrow), and I'm wishing Sandra, Austen, and I could've spent more time at Millenium Park in West Roxbury (man, that park is gorgeous&#8212;and HUGE!), but I'm also glad to be home. Everything about this vacation turned out great, from the planned Monday departure and Saturday return (so we'd have a couple days to chill out at home before and after the trip) to the unplanned minivan rental and hotel stay in Old Port. What a fun week!

<h3 class="title">BlogHer Panic Sets In</h3>

<p>
As I was getting dressed for my walk this morning, it occurred to me that <a href="http://blogher.org/about-blogher-conference-06" target="a8_win">BlogHer</a> is only three weekends away... and I totally panicked. My first thought was, "I DON'T WANT TO GO," and then the following internal conversation ensued:
</p>

<p>
<strong>me: </strong>You <em>do too</em> want to go.<br />
<strong>me: </strong>No, really, I don't. We just got back from Maine! That's enough traveling.<br />
<strong>me: </strong>You're just chicken. You don't want to meet new people, you big pussy.<br />
<strong>me: </strong>It's true, I'm chicken. I don't want to meet new people. I like the people I already know just fine; why complicate things? I object to the 'pussy' characterization, however.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure I'm not the only introvert who signed up for BlogHer in a moment of self-delusion. There are probably plenty of women who feel very confident when they're writing from behind a computer screen, plenty of women who feel like they know the bloggers whose names they regularly drop in conversation ("Mrs. Kennedy had this really interesting <a href="http://www.fussy.org/2006/06/sugar-shock.html">post on sugar</a> the other day... Alice&#8212;you know, Finslippy&#8212;had a <a href="http://finslippy.typepad.com/finslippy/2006/06/and_here_i_thou.html">nightmare experience with her babysitter</a> that totally brought back <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/06/i_want_to_vomit_1.html">bad</a> <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/06/antidote_1.html">memories</a>...Oh, no! Mainely Madge <a href="http://mainelymadge.typepad.com/mainely_madge/2006/06/fixation_follie.html">isn't going to make it to BlogHer!</a>..."), plenty of women who feel that blogs and blogging have saved their lives, plenty of women who are now scared shitless that no one will really like the not-as-funny, not-as-skinny, not-as-hip, not-as-connected, not-as-extroverted, and still-somewhat-acne-prone real person behind the keyboard. In fact, we might actually outnumber the blog celebrities at the conference. We'll probably never know the power of our numbers, however, because we'll each be hiding behind a different potted plant.

<h3 class="title">Yoooos! Yooooos!</h3>

<p>
I'm feeling a little guilty today because I hid the loves of Austen's life: his two blue shoes. He walked around the bedroom this morning calling "yoooos! yoooooos!", and he removed every single item from the white wire basket into which we usually toss the shoes at night, saying "no yooo" as each item was laid aside. It about broke my heart, and more than once I considered retrieving the blue shoes from the top of my closet, but I stuck it out.
</p>

<p>
His toes appeared to be bumping the end of those shoes, and he was starting to walk funny again&#8212;the way he did when his last pair of shoes became too tight&#8212;so taking them away seemed like the only thing to do. Luckily, although he answered "no" when I held up the black Pumas and said, "don't you want to wear these?", he did not object when Al put those same black Pumas on his feet. (Ironically, the infant-sized Pumas seem to run a little big, whereas the adult versions run at least a half size small.) I figure we can get a couple more weeks out of the black Pumas, at least, before we have to move to the size 7 green ones. Al is lobbying for a replacement pair of blue NBs, but the current pair was tough enough to find. I'll try, though.
</p>

<h3 class="title">More Iced Coffee, Please</h3>

<p>
[Yes, I'm drinking decaf again, though I'm back to the 3 or 4 parts milk:1 part coffee ratio I thought I'd evolved from when I went to short decaf lattes*.] I love my cozy little nook of an office in what I call the gallery, a 100" x 75" (yes, ", not ') space with a window at the top of the stairs, but god<em>damn</em> is it hot up here. There's an air conditioning vent just to the right of my desk, and Austen's room (the doorway of which forms the boundary of my space), with its two vents, is bearable, but I think the three laptop computers + external monitor plus whatever physical law it is that makes heat rise are working against me. Oh yeah, and did I mention that the gallery is on the south side of the house? Phe-yew!
</p>

<p>
Speaking of my office and my oodles of hardware and wiring, I'm finding it hard to get back into the grind after our vacation to Maine. I'm fixing bugs and participating in meetings and all that, but I find myself daydreaming about what life was like before I went back to work. I suspect I'm thinking more of the year I took off before Austen was born (when I did a bit of contracting, a lot of housework, and whatever else I wanted to do, whenever I wanted to do it) rather than the 13 months of SAHMhood that directly preceeded my current full-time employment, though it'd be fun to go to the playground or music class or the pool with Austen, too.
</p>

<p>
I almost think that what would suit me best in the summer is working San Francisco hours. By that I don't mean working 10am to 7pm, as I did when I lived out there, but rather hours that coincide with when my San Francisco colleagues are in the office&#8212;roughly 12:30pm to 9:30pm EST. That would give me mornings free to tool around with Austen, run errands, etc., and it would mean that I'd be in front of my computer at the time of day when I feel most productive (usually from 5pm-8pm or so). Unfortunately, those hours conflict with dinner, bathtime, and Austen's bedtime, not to mention husband and wife time. Hrrm.
</p>

<p>
*When we were in Norwood, Mass. recently, I ordered an iced decaf tall latte at the Starbucks down the street from our hotel, and the employee who took my order called it out to the barista as an "iced decaf tall lotty." I haven't been able to get that particular Bostonardization out of my head ever since.**
</p>

<p>
**I think the urge to write randomly and with even-more-random footnotes comes from catching up with <a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/" target="a8_win">Mimi Smartypants</a>, whom I only read a few times a year, yesterday.

<h3 class="title">I'm Just Antisocial</h3>

<p>
Eson asked in a comment on the shoes post, "what is this BlogHer that you and others talk so much about, and why not want to go?", and I was in the middle of replying to the comment when I decided that really, this demanded an entire post.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://blogher.org/about-blogher-conference-06">BlogHer</a> is a conference for women bloggers (though men are of course invited, too). The idea is to get together and talk about blogging, learn from each other's experiences, get some technical tips, and, probably most importantly, meet the bloggers we read. I obviously do want to go&#8212;I signed up and paid for the conference, after all&#8212;but I'm just feeling a little freaked about about having to socialize. I usually manage OK when I get out in social situations (well, most of the time), but I get all angsty and stressed out ahead of any social event, and I usually have to be shoved out the door and locked out of the house so I don't just put on my jammies and crawl into bed.
</p>

<p>
If my dear friend and former roommate of five years, Pat, were still alive, she could testify to how many times she put a boot to my back and forced me out of our Arlington, VA apartment (and also how many times she heard me whine from the other side of the door, "oh, <em>ohkaaaay.</em> I guess I'll go <em>have a good time.</em>") For the record, I usually *did* have a good time, but that fact never decreased my anxiety or reluctance to leave the house. Heck, half the time I didn't socialize at all while out; I'd just listen to the band and try to preserve a bubble of personal space around me. Knowing that I didn't really <em>have</em> to talk to anyone also didn't decrease the anxiety, though, so you can imagine what knowing that I really <em>do</em> have to talk to people (if I want to get my money's worth, and if my stated main reason for wanting to go to BlogHer&#8212;to meet the bloggers I read&#8212;is really true) at BlogHer is doing to me.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't kidding when I said that there were probably zillions of other introverts who signed up for BlogHer in a moment of self-delusion. I actually think there are tons of us. In fact, I think that blogging probably appeals most to people who have an internal monologue going all the time, but who don't necessarily want to talk to other people (or who don't particularly <em>like</em> other people most of the time). I bet I'm not the only one who'd rather send an e-mail than pick up the phone (and who answers phone messages with e-mails whenever possible). 
</p>

<p>
Also, I think that even many of the blog celebrities wonder whether anyone will really like them in person (or, if they're at least sure of their audience's adoration, they may wonder *why* everyone really likes them). I don't know if this is a woman thing or a blogger thing, or whether it's neither, or perhaps both (maybe this is something we can talk about while drinking around the hotel pool), but I suspect we're all of us a bit nervous. Maybe everyone else is nervous for different reasons than I am, but I suspect they're nervous nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
Me, I'm nervous for all the reasons I outlined in the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/07/blogher_panic_s.html">BlogHer Panic Sets In</a> post (though to be honest, I've been feeling pretty good in the body image department lately, and anyone who thinks my ass is fat or my hair is dorky can go to hell <span style="font-size:smaller">but please don't stare at the zits adjacent to my approaching-middle-age wrinkles</span>), and for a few that I didn't mention in that post, namely:
</p>

<ol>
<li>If I drink at the evening cocktail parties, will I get drunk and feel crappy and then waste an entire day of the conference with day-after depression? (This is one of the reasons I rarely drink anymore: the next day depression can be CRUSHING.)</li>
<li>If I just have a glass of wine or a foofoo cocktail, will it throw my body into sugar shock and make me irritable (and once again a slave to sugar cravings)? I don't want to go back to that.</li>
<li>Will the cocktail parties by the pool be any fun if I don't drink?</li>
<li>Will I spend the cocktail parties by the pool fruitlessly trying to chat up people who look more lonely and lost than I do, being shrugged off by interesting people, and then just going back to my room to call Al, as I did at DevCon in 2002?</li>
<li>Will I be able to glean any useful information for a project at work/take any useful notes for said project and still be able to interact with other BlogHers? This worries me because I want to strike the right balance between work and play. What if I spend so much time taking notes that I don't actually <em>participate</em>? (This is my usual MO: Blog about or photograph the proceedings rather than participate in them.) Or, less likely, what if I'm having such a good time whooping it up with my new BlogHer friends that I don't collect any useful info for work?</li>
<li>Is the 6:30am flight to SFO, followed by a full day in the office, followed by a two-hour Caltrain ride to San Jose, followed by two days of BlogHer, followed by a 7:30am flight from SJC back to Philadelphia (via Denver, I think) overambitious? Am I going to be too exhausted to do anything fun while I'm at the conference, or worse, to handle work/home responsibilities when I get back?</li>
<li>Am I going to miss anything fun on Thursday night, while I'm riding the Caltrain down to SJC? (This concern is probably laughable, given all my other concerns about being social. :)</li>
</ol>

<p>
So there they are: my anxieties laid bare. Incidentally, I think this will be the first conference I've attended in a long, long time where I was not speaking in at least one session. Although I've gotten quite good at giving technical presentations on subjects I'm passionate about, I'm glad I don't have to deal with the feedback from the audience, both immediate (I had a woman cry in a JavaScript course I was giving once) and after the fact (I tend to take the comment forms to heart). I do feel like something's missing, however, knowing I don't have to get all my PowerPoint slides (or, more likely, my HTML facsimilies of PowerPoint slides) and handouts in order before I go. I just have to make sure I have all the computer equipment I need for that day in the office, plus my camera, memory cards, power cables, extra batteries, etc. Egads, add another anxiety: how am I going to fit all that crap into my backpack?

<h3 class="title">Deangstified</h3>

<p>
For anyone who's been following along with my tales of BlogHer anxiety, I have an update: I think talking about them here has really helped (hey, maybe that's why therapy works? hmmmm). That, and looking at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/blogher/clusters/fussy-mightygirl/">photos of last year's BlogHer</a> on Flickr. Doesn't look so intimidating.
</p> 

<p>
So anyway, I am once again looking forward to going.
</p>

<p>
In other news, it is so freakin' muggy here today! We're having the kind of weather New Orleans is famous for&#8212;and can I just say that the weather is probably the #1 reason I don't live in New Orleans? Yuck.

When does "escalating violence" become war? I wouldn't necessarily say that the use of missles, warplanes, and ground troops alone constitutes war, since the U.S. has been known to use all three in numerous non-war contexts over the past 20 years, but the fact that both sides in this conflict are using them makes me think WAR.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/15/education/15report.html" target="a8_win">Public Schools Perform Near Private Ones in Study</a><br />
Don't be fooled by the headline: The body of the article reveals that public school students did as well as or <em>better than</em> their private school counterparts except in eighth-grade reading. For whatever it's worth... (and it's worth reading the whole article).

<h3 class="title">Potato, Potahto</h3>

<p>
One of Austen's favorite songs (or rather, one of my favorite songs to sing to Austen, and one which he tolerates) is Let's Call The Whole Thing Off. You know, the "you say eether, I say iither" song. This weekend Al suggested that we could make up new lyrics to it based on Austen's current manglings of the English language, and I related this suggestion to Hannah this morning. The version we came up with went something like this:
</p>

<p>
I say water and you say li'lo<br />
I say stroller and you say llor<br/ >
Water, li'lo, stroller, llor<br />
Let's call the whole thing off
</p>

<p>
I say cantaloupe and you say lopelope<br />
I say car and you say go<br />
Cantaloupe, lopelope, car, go<br />
Let's call the whole thing off.
</p>

<p>
I could go on, of course. After weeks of Austen saying "ahdjuwah," I finally said to Al in exasperation this morning, "what the heck is 'ahdjuwah'? Do you know what 'ahdjuwah' means?" He did not. Hannah figured it out from the context when we were serving up melon in the kitchen later, though. Apparently she often asks him, "do you want another one?", so we now think that "ahdjuwah" means "another one." Austen nodded when we proposed this, so I think she's right.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and did I mention that Austen knows what a Saab is? Austen has been pointing out "go"s for weeks, but while we were on vacation in Maine we realized that he was pointing out <em>very specific</em> gos. It's uncanny that he can pick out 9-3 hatchbacks (like our 1999 model), 9-3 sedans, 9-5 sedans and wagons, even 9000s. Al said, "those are Saabs!", so now Austen will yell "ba!" (also the word for "bus", though "bus" is starting to have an "esh" sound on the end&#8212;all words that end in s end in esh for Austen, including eish, yesh, and reish) every time he spots a Saab. Occasionally he'll confuse a VW Jetta or a Mazda 6 for a Saab, but more often than not if he yells "ba!", there's a Saab nearby.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Another Heat Generator Arrives on My Desk</h3>

<p>
My new MacBook actually arrived last week, but as I haven't had to do a Mac build until today, I didn't bother setting it up. Now it's up and running, and man, is it FAST! It's quite a thrill to see two files compiling at the same time in XCode. I kinda want to stay up to see how long it takes to do a clean build so I can compare to the regular PowerBook, but I also want to get to bed so I can read. (I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=avocado8&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0767914767%2F">The Devil Wears Prada</a>, a book I'd never had any desire to read until I saw the movie this weekend and liked it. It made me curious about the book.)
</p>

<p>
Oh, right, I was talking about the MacBook. After a few hours of having it on my desk, I can already say I love it; it has all the great features of the PowerBook plus a built-in camera, fun PhotoBooth software, and did I mention the speed? I'm sure there's a bunch of other features I haven't discovered yet, too. The only downside I've found is that the thing runs HOT. Super HOT. So hot that it's uncomfortable to rest your wrists on it while typing (is this a ploy by Apple to get us to keep our hands in a non-carpal-tunnel-inducing position?). At the moment I've got it propped up on a little plastic container of Q-Tips, and the hotter left side is hanging off of its cardboard pedestal to allow for more air circulation on that side, but it's still super hot. I'm actually worried that the Q-Tip container might melt (another good reason to stay up and see the build finish).
</p>

<p>
UPDATE: The build just finished&#8212;<em><strong>in 28 minutes</strong></em>. That is 107 minutes faster than the best clean build time on the PowerBook. Woo FREAKIN' hoo!!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Wasp!</h3>

<p>
So I'm sitting here at my desk on the top floor of our house, quietly fixing bugs, when a bug of the actual insect variety suddenly FLIES RIGHT AT ME, out of nowhere. I shrieked, of course, especially when I realized it was a WASP. I finally got him with a rolled-up stack of source code printouts, but not before several misses that really seemed to piss him off. I'm still kind of freaked out. Where the hell did a WASP come from?

<h3 class="title">Busy Weekend Update Coming</h3>

<p>
I wish Mondays weren't my short days (Hannah's here from 8am-3pm, and then I work again for a couple hours after Al gets home at 6pm) because inevitably I have weekend news to share, and no time to blog. Hopefully I'll hit a good breaking point at bathtime and use the time between when Austen goes to sleep and I do to blog instead of work.
</p>

<p>
Short synopsis: On Saturday I got a new haircut, and we went to our first <a href="http://www.rocknrompbaltimore.com/">Rock 'n Romp</a> afterwards in Baltimore. On Sunday Austen and I spent the day riding the subway, learning to share at the playground, eating pizza, and walking around NYC with Tris and Henry. Tons of photos and a few stories to come, hopefully tonight!
</p>

<h3 class="title">D:fiance</h3>

<p>
None of the hair products I currently own work <em>quite right</em> with my new haircut, so I decided to try <strong>d:fi</strong>, a product that a good friend's (ex-)girlfriend and <a href="http://www.fussy.org/2006/03/okay-so-i-guess-this-is-second.html">Mrs. Kennedy</a> happened to recommended in the same week back in March. I'm allergic to the vast majority of hair products, but tales of a pi&ntilde;a colada scent sounded appealing (one of the few products I can tolerate smells like pineapple Life Savers, and in my mind pi&ntilde;a colada = pineapple = no problem!), so I went in search of the stuff.
</p>

<p>
I finally located a salon in Philly that sells it last night, but it was closed, so I made another trip at lunchtime today (after using a standard three-weeks-plus-past-bleaching mix of the old Phyto Pro 8 gel&#8212;why, oh why, did they change the formula on this orange-rosemary-scented wonder?&#8212;and Laminates gel and letting my hair air-dry). When I returned with a jar of d:fi d:struct pliable molding creme (and some tuna salad, tomato and mozzarella salad, and an olive roll from DiBruno Bros.), I promptly stuck my finger into the pot.
</p>

<p>
I was expecting something hard and waxy, but my finger sunk all the way to the bottom of the jar; the consistency was more like warm canned frosting. I rubbed what clung to my finger as I removed it into the palm of my other hand and proceeded to smash it into my head. It's now 30 minutes later, and I have no hair product headache, I smell delicious, and my hair looks the way I want it to (really!). Mrs. Kennedy is right: shit is miraculous.

<h3 class="title">News From Our Busy Weekend</h3>

<p>So as I mentioned in the previous post, we had a busy weekend. I probably should have spent the weekend doing laundry and cleaning the house and bleaching my hair and making packing lists in preparation for BlogHer (I only remembered last night that I'd be IN THE OFFICE on Thursday and not calling into meetings, and that I'd need to have everything washed and ready to be packed on Wednesday in preparation for the 6:20am flight on Thursday), but instead I spent it getting my hair cut in the suburbs of DC, <a href="http://www.rocknrompbaltimore.com/">rocking and romping</a> in Baltimore, and riding the subways and running around the West Village in NYC.</p>


<p>First, the new haircut. (This isn't really news anymore, since I jumped ahead and posted about <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/07/defiance.html">d:fi</a>, but anyway...) <a href="http://www.hugosalon.com/">Toni</a> always does an amazing job, but I've noticed that the less guidance I give her, the more likely I am to get what I want. This time I just said, &quot;I like it pretty short, except in front&#8212;I need something to hang some color on there.&quot; What I got was this really cool &quot;pinwheel&quot; cut that two other stylists came over to ask about. It's exactly as requested&#8212;short everywhere except in front&#8212;plus it's spiky, asymetrical, and interesting, three other things I love.</p>

<p>After the haircut we made a mad dash up traffic-choked I-95 to Baltimore for our first-ever <a href="http://www.rocknrompbaltimore.com/">Rock 'n Romp</a>. I'd read about it on <a href="http://www.sweetney.com/">Tracey's site</a>, and after clicking through to the sound clip of the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sicksickbirds">Sick Sick Birds</a> (who were scheduled to play on Saturday), I'd decided I wanted to go. The only thing that remained was convincing Al. He finally bent to my will when his brother proposed that they play golf together on Sunday; I think knowing that he could have a day to do what <em>he</em> wanted to do made a day of running around and being <em>social</em> bearable.  </p>

Sarah White | Sick Sick Birds<br />
Danny</p>
<p>
I think Al even had a good time playing with Austen and listening to the music. I really dug the Sick Sick Birds, as expected, and the lyrics to Danny's songs were hi-fucking-larious. I think even better than the music was meeting other alternaparents&#8212;though of  course alternamusic was the reason for the plethora of alternaparents. I spent quite a while talking to a woman named Maryann (MaryAnn? Marianne? I should see if Tracey has her e-mail address...) who looked like a normal mom on the outside, but who turned out to be super cool. Her current haircut was deceiving; apparently, she used to have a bleached-white spiky do like mine. We also had our kids in common&#8212;or rather, the fact that we had to be talked into having them. For her, it took 7 years of convincing before she finally caved. We were also together in the &quot;one and done&quot; camp. I wish now that I'd introduced myself properly and gotten some contact info from her, even though she lives down near Annapolis (too far for regular schmoozing, sadly). </p>

That's Maryann in the blue sleeveless top (top left), and her son is in the blue Hawaiian shirt (bottom right). </p>
<p>Austen's favorite thing in the back yard was the giant, three-wand, no-spill bucket of bubbles. Actually, now that I think about it (and look at the photos), this was almost every kid's favorite thing. Another big hit was the super-cool slide, though the platform at the top was rather narrow and pitched slightly away from the slide. After racing down a couple times, Austen climbed to the top again with Al's help&#8212;and then promptly lost his balance, stepped back to right himself, and found his foot striking thin air. He disappeared off the platform rather suddenly (I was standing at the bottom of the slide, waiting to take his photo as he came down), and for a moment, I froze. I think I instinctively knew I couldn't get there in time to catch him, so I stayed exactly where I was, trying to see what, if anything, he hit on the way down. Luckily Al had ahold of an arm, which slowed his progress until Al had to let go (the post was between them), and another mom broke his fall slightly (enough to keep him from getting tangled in a swing or striking his head, anyway). Still, it TOTALLY freaked Austen out, and after that the only word he said for a long time was &quot;go&quot;. As in &quot;let's leave,&quot; rather than &quot;there's a car!&quot; It was a little heartbreaking the way he pointed to the gate.</p>

<p>I finally convinced Austen that there was enough fun still to be had to make it worth staying for a little while longer (I *really* wanted to see the Sick Sick Birds, and Austen fell as Sarah White's band was breaking down). The butterfly bushes and other wonderful flowering plants in Tracey's yard really helped, as they attracted actual butterflies. Austen was enchanted by them, calling them &quot;whys&quot; and pointing whenever he spotted one. And of course, there was the big bucket of bubbles.</p>
<p class="pictureP"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/197083031/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/69/197083031_f0359e9e5b_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="bubbles!" /></a></p>
<p>We left (after listening to a couple wonderful songs from Danny, his computer, and his accordian) when it became obvious that Austen was really done for the day. Quite honestly, we were too&#8212;the heat and humidity were tiring, and we still had a two-hour drive back to Philadelphia (in what turned out to be a scary series of thunderstorms).  The triumph of the day for me was hearing Al say that he'd go to another Rock n' Romp event in the future.</p>
<p>On Sunday we all got up early (earlier than we usually do on weekdays) to drive up to NYC so Al could meet his brother for golf. My sister-in-law Tris, her son Henry, Austen, and I hung out and played in the apartment for a while&#8212;Austen and Henry had great fun chasing each other up and down the long hallway&#8212;and then we took the C train down to the West Village to visit Henry's favorite playground. We stayed there for at least an hour, maybe more; long enough, at least, for Austen to have several meltdowns every time he wanted to play with a toy that someone else was using (or vice versa). I literally had to pry him out of the extremely popular bug car a couple times, while he screamed and cried like he was being tortured. Several parents looked horrified and tried to interest their children in another toy, saying, &quot;oh, no, it's OK, he can keep playing with it,&quot; but I just said, &quot;he's got to learn how to share sometime!&quot; while trying to fish him out.</p>
<p class="pictureP">

<p>Each time we gave another kid a turn, I'd have to hold Austen on my lap for a little while and talk him down. I explained about sharing, and how the toy wasn't his, it was for everybody to use, and that he could have another turn when the other kids were done with it. He finally sort of chilled out when I gave him a half a peanut butter sandwich (talk about weapons on the playground!) and he got interested in chasing Henry up and down the ramp and around the sandpit.</p>
<p>From the playground we walked over to John's Pizza for lunch. We ordered two small pizzas (one cheese, one mushroom), but when it came time to actually eat them, Austen refused to wear his bib. (Al later correctly identified the problem: Henry wasn't wearing a bib&#8212;he's 4, and much less messy&#8212;and Austen loves to copy Henry.) I insisted that he wear the bib if he wanted to eat pizza, and once I took that stand, I kind of wished I hadn't. It would have been so much easier to cave and just let him eat&#8212;we were in a public place, after all, with company, and he was totally making a scene&#8212;but once I pick a battle with my kid, I win it.   Tris confessed that it made her a little bit happy to see other kids act out in public, as it made her feel less bad about Henry's antics, but I wasn't amused. I finally just ate my own pizza and left Austen alone until he started saying &quot;UP! UP!&quot; and motioning that he wanted to get out of his high chair.</p>
<p>I brought him up onto the booth bench with me, where he noodled about for a bit and then reached for some pizza. I said, &quot;no, you have to wear your bib if you want some pizza,&quot; at which point he struggled and screamed and tried to twist away from me. I'd finally had enough, so I wrestled the bib onto him and then held it firmly in place so he couldn't yank it off, and then as he opened his mouth to wail&#8212;yes, there were actual tears rolling down his face&#8212;I shoved a little piece of pizza into his maw. He closed his mouth on it, sniffled, and then started to chew. &quot;It's good, huh?&quot; I said. He smiled sheepishly, and that was then end of the bib drama. He ended up eating two (small) pieces of pizza <em>with the bib on</em>.</p>

</p>
<p>After pizza we went next door to Cones, where Henry had a scoop of vanilla ice cream (his choice), and Austen had a scoop of watermelon sorbet (my choice). Since I wouldn't be eating the sorbet, I wasn't sure how to choose (usually Al and Austen share something, so Al chooses), so I just went with one of Austen's favorite fruits. He seemed to enjoy it well enough, though I could tell from the  measured way he ate the stuff that he didn't like it as much as gelato from Capogiro. From Cones we moseyed back to the Bleecker Playground so I could change Austen's diaper on a bench outside the play area. Austen didn't want to ride in the stroller, and after a couple blocks Tris and I got tired of carrying him, so we assigned Henry the task of holding Austen's hand. Henry took this job very seriously.</p>

</p>
<p>After the diaper change, the plan was for Austen to fall asleep in the stroller while we walked back to the subway via the meat-packing district, but Austen was in no mood to nap. I honestly think he was afraid he might miss something (especially an opportunity to mimic Henry). When we got back to the apartment Austen still refused to lie down, instead resuming the game of chase-Henry-up-and-down-the-hall that the boys had abandoned when we went out. I'd never heard Austen pant before, but he was puffing pretty loudly by the time we announced it was time to go home (Al and Carl came back from golfing about 15 minutes after we came in). We left with a giant bag of toys that Henry'd outgrown, plus a few items of clothing from Tris and Carl, plus Henry's push-tricycle. Total bonanza! The only thing we didn't leave with were bagels and lox; we were too tired to see if Barney Greengrass or H&amp;H were still open. I regretted that on Monday morning, but I was thrilled to have such a happy, eventful family weekend. Yay! </p>

<h3 class="title">Why I Will Not Be Real-Time Blogging Today</h3>

<p>
I will not be real-time blogging today, a la <a href="http://www.amalah.com/amalah/2006/07/packing_diary_i.html">amalah</a>, because, although real-time blogging is often hi-fucking-larious, it will in no way calm me down, help me pack, or prepare me for BlogHer. Trust me: Real-time blogging only <em>adds</em> to the stress. 
</p>

<p>
If I <em>were</em> real-time blogging, in this very space there would be a minute-by-minute account of how I:
</p>
<ul>
<li>tried to save myself time by printing out my United boarding pass</li>
<li>discovered that my printer is totally whacked and can only print crookedly</li>
<li>tried to print to the basement printer instead</li>
<li>got an error that the printer was "offline"</li>
<li>tromped down three flights of stairs to investigate</li>
<li>discovered that husband had unplugged printer from power and router in preparation for dismantling printer stand</li>
<li>heard "click" sound while reconnecting printer and realized I'd accidentally knocked the button that puts the cable modem on standby</li>
<li>re-engaged cable modem</li>
<li>tromped up three flights of stairs</li>
<li>tried to re-print</li>
<li>discovered that putting the cable modem on standby&#8212;however briefly&#8212;totally fucked up the router and the wireless network, knocking all three laptops off the network (not to mention VPN)</li>
<li>tromped back down three flights of stairs</li>
<li>re-started cable modem and router/print server</li>
<li>stomped up to kitchen for nuts to fuel my climb back up stairs</li>
<li>continued up to top floor</li>
<li>reconnected to networks and VPN</li>
<li>re-printed boarding pass, which I will probably leave sitting on the printer in the basement instead of folding neatly into my carry-on bag.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remember, the goal at the beginning of this scenario was to SAVE MYSELF TIME. God forbid I try to make up the time lost tromping up and down the stairs by MAKING A PACKING LIST or figuring out a minute-by-minute schedule of how I'm going to fix 17 bugs, paint my toenails, shave my legs, and pack my bags. Oh, hey look, my flight tomorrow morning leaves 20 minutes later than I thought. What WILL I do with all that extra time?

<h3 class="title">Wardrobe Change</h3>

<p>
I almost got all freaked out over possibly being the worst-dressed person at BlogHer (you mean my purple Adidas sneakers are too schleppy? a fitted t-shirt from REI is too casual?), but you know what? I'm not going to suddenly get a fabulous wardrobe in the next 5 hours, and I refuse to pack 5 pairs of shoes and every Prada shirt that Al's brother ever handed down to me just in case. (I'm already packing my walking sneakers and my Keen mary janes and wearing the aforementioned Adidas&#8212;or perhaps packing the Adidas and wearing the mary janes for airport security purposes&#8212;because I can't function without my morning walk, and the Adidas sneakers are more for moseying than for serious exercise-walking.)
</p>

<p>
I'm a frickin' jeans-and-t-shirt-wearing software engineer/mommy blogger, damn it. And I'm packing light!*
</p>

<p style="font-size:smaller;">
*Well, light for me. Backpack with two laptops, camera, and snacks plus carryon with various chargers, a few articles of clothing, two pairs of shoes, toiletries, meds, and makeup (DUDE! I wear makeup 9 days out of 10, even though I work at home, and this weekend I'll be OUT IN PUBLIC).

<h3 class="title">Home/Office</h3>

<p>
I can't believe I'm functional right now. I said to Al when I set my alarm for 4am last night, "watch, this'll be the night that the Boopster wakes up screaming in the middle of the night instead of sleeping until 6 or 7." Sure enough, at 3am, we heard him cry. Usually we let him settle down on his own, but within minutes his screams turned frantic, so Al went up and got him. The irony, of course, is that I'd just gotten to sleep myself when Austen woke up.
</p>

<p>
Usually I fall asleep easily and stay asleep until morning, but last night I slept lightly, if at all. Every time I could feel myself relaxing in preparation for a deeper sleep, Al would breathe funny or a car would zoom by, and I was wide awake again. Once Austen nuzzled into my shoulder I was able to fall asleep (and so was he), but of course by that time I only had an hour until the alarm went off.
</p>

<p>
My flight was uneventful, and I made it to the office in time to catch most of the weekly team meeting. I've got another meeting in 5 minutes, a code review to do for another engineer, and a bunch of bug fixes to check in (yes, I actually fixed bugs instead of sleeping for most of the 5 hr. 20 min. flight). I hope I can stay awake until at least 9pm, which is when I'm likely to arrive at the Hyatt San Jose. Unless there are some super-cool BlogHers ready to rally me when I walk in the door, I'm going straight to bed!

<h3 class="title">BlogHer Day 0</h3>

<p>
OK, I'm sitting in the lobby of the Hyatt San Jose, and there are women with laptops EVERYWHERE. And women eating. And women drinking. And women laughing. This woman is reading her e-mail and trying to decide if the nausea means I should eat something or that I'm just freaking EXHAUSTED. Probably both. I'm seriously fading, folks. The only reason I'm in the lobby is for wireless access, and so the room has time to cool down (the A/C wasn't on when I arrived). OK, a few more e-mails to read, and then I eat. Or sleep. Whichever comes first.

<p>
OK, it's almost 9pm, and I'm eating a room service caesar salad with shrimp. I'm stil exhausted, but I can now confirm that the nausea and headache were mostly due to hunger. The reason for having to re-type that last sentence four times? THAT'S due to the exhaustion.

I know nobody cares what I had for <s>lunch</s> dinner, but here it is anyway
</p>

<p>
The hotel room is fine, if a little dated/shabby. I can't decide if they're going for colonial, western rustic, or antique chic.

<p>
I'll be carrying the Mac around with me tomorrow and seeing how it works as an actual laptop rather than a source-code building workhorse. I've already had reason to be glad I brought it: At 3:45pm my time (6:45pm EDT), Austen, Al and I experienced our first video iChat. Al hooked up the iSight to the Mac mini, and I used the one built-in to the MacBook, and we could see and hear each other so well it was like we were in the same room. Several of my co-workers came over to wave at the camera and see Austen in person&#8212;suddenly all the recent photos I loaded onto the Mac in case anyone asked what he looked like seem so irrelevant&#8212;and Austen and I clapped and pointed and laughed and smooched. His laugh came through loud and clear, and it was so nice to share his normal personality with my colleagues (last time he visited the office he'd just woken from a nap and wouldn't stop crying). 
</p>

<p>
The main reason I brought the Mac was so I could verify builds before checking in, of course, but it'll also be handy for downloading BlogHer photos (iPhoto will do the trick just fine, no proprietary camera software necessary), taking fun PhotoBooth shots, and now that I've had a taste of heaven and know what I've been missing, video chatting with Austen. I can't wait to wave at him again tomorrow!

<h3 class="title">Let the Men Pee</h3>

<p>
Yes, there are men here at BlogHer, and one of the first announcements of the day was that there were only two bathrooms in this building&#8212;one for men, and one for women&#8212;and that while it may occasionally be OK to guard the men's room door so a gaggle of women can avoid the line at the women's room, we can't completely commandeer the place. LET THE MEN PEE was the plea.
</p>



<p>
Now that the first session has started and everyone's blogging and uploading photos, network connectivity has ground to an absolute halt, so I'm making notes in TextEdit and uploading whenever the network comes alive. I'm posting photos to Flickr occasionally on the same basis.
</p>

<p>
I've already run into a couple famous bloggers&#8212;Tracey from <a href="http://www.sweetney.com/">sweetney</a>, in whose backyard we were rocking and romping last weekend; and Alice from <a href="http://finslippy.typepad.com/">finslippy</a>, whom I met in the bathroom&#8212;but for the most part it's the somewhat-less-famous bloggers I'm enjoying chatting with most. I was talking with Amy Muller this morning about work and kids this morning when I realized I'd read one of her posts once (randomly, by following a link on another blog). I was like, wait, are you the woman who had an opportunity to get your kid into the dream school a year earlier than anticipated, and were agonizing over whether you should grab it or not? And yes! <a href="http://mommybrain.net/2006/03/22/and-i-didnt-even-volunteer-at-a-bake-sale/">Yes, she was.</a> So that was neat.

Amy, out of focus (der, yeah, I know how to use a camera)
</p>

<p>
I also chatted with Ani and Heather (mostly Heather) about deciding you need a change and then moving to a new place to start over. Heather did that a couple years ago when she quit her Bay Area job and moved from Berkeley to Santa Monica, and I've done it a couple times (DC -> NY/CT, CT -> CA, and CA -> PA) myself.

At the moment I'm sharing a table with <a href="http://www.cussandotherrants.com/">Suzanne</a>, <a href="http://princessbookworm.blogspot.com/">Jeanne</a>, <a href="http://slolane.org">Angela</a>, and <a href="http://megonian.wordpress.com/">Megan</a>, and we're sort of half-listening to the speakers and half-being silly, taking photos of each other and everyone else. (Oh, and Suzanne's busy fixing her RSS feed.) Meanwhile, Marc Canter is being part facilitator, part instigator/heckler by shouting obvious questions from the peanut gallery (q: "what's the difference between a widget, a module, and a plugin?" answer: "they're the same, really. it's just semantics." q: "does that have anything to do with the semantic web?" a: "ah, no." [much laughter from the in-the-knows]).

<h3 class="title">Whew, I May Have Reached My Daily Socializing Limit</h3>

<p>
I don't know how I'm going to make it to the cocktail party. I've spoken to about a dozen women so far (I know, I know&#8212;I haven't even made a dent, given that there are about 750 women here), and I'm already running out of steam. <a href="http://www.fussy.org/">Mrs. Kennedy</a> is sitting here with me now, listening to the podcasting presentation, but we're both mostly blogging and having a bit of quiet time. I'm finding that I don't want to have to think about things to say anymore.

<h3 class="title">Time to Rally</h3>

<p>
I rallied for a little bit during the Q &amp; A part of the podcast session to chat with Mrs. Kennedy about ice hockey and haircuts and our living/working arrangements, but now I'm taking a break in my room. I'm hoping that Al and Austen get back from the King of Pizza in the next 10 minutes, so I'll have time to video chat with them before going to the Design/Style/Customization session at 5:15.
</p>

<p>
 I'm also hoping that this little break will get me psyched for more schmoozing. If only I could nap and video chat at the same time! Actually, I probably could; all I'd have to do is leave the laptop on and let Austen watch me sleep. Of course, then I wouldn't see him.... Well, fart. 
</p>

<p>
By the way, I'm tagging all my BlogHer photos with both blogher and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/blogher06/">blogher06</a>, so if you search by tag you'll see the latest. The last couple sessions were fairly dimly lit, so I didn't get much worth seeing, but hopefully&#8212;if I rally successfully&#8212;I'll get some shots from the cocktail party by the pool.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Yeah, So, Day 2</h3>

<p>
I realized that I haven't blogged at all today, which is probably a good sign&#8212;it means that I'm actually out socializing and interacting and watching presentations rather than hiding behind my computer. This is really the first session that I've felt like I could listen partway while blogging at the same time.
</p>

<p>
I had a pretty nice time at the cocktail party last night, talking with old friends and making new ones. (For those of you who read about my anxiety over whether or not to drink, I ended up having half a glass of wine, followed by a glass of milk.) I also ended up staying up a bit too late, but whatever, I enjoyed all the conversation and I'm not sleeping well right now anyway.

</p>

<p>
This morning I'd intended to go to the Mommy Blogging session, even though that term is making me increasingly nauseous, but just as it was getting started Al called. I made my way outside to take the call, and when I poked my head back into the room afterwards, it was completely full. I figured I'd go see Maggie's session on Is the Next Martha Stewart a Blogger?, and boy, did that turn out to be cool. Maggie, who was moderating, made some fabulous points, as did the panelists. Maggie's got an idea that women need to talk more about money&#8212;how much they make, how much they charge for their services, how much they pay for help, etc.&#8212;and I really think she's right. So many women give their talents away for free because they either don't know what to charge or don't think their services are worth charging for. If we get together and talk about these things, we gain leverage. Think about it, my fellow women.
</p>

<p>
After Maggie I had lunch with Jeanne and Suzanne and met Suebob from <a href="http://redstapler23.blogspot.com/">red stapler</a>, and then Jeanne and I flipped a coin to decide whether to go to From Here to Autonomy or Let's Talk About Sex. It was heads, so we went to From Here to Autonomy. We were sitting in the back, so it took me a minute to realize that one of the speakers was the <a href="http://www.blogaholics.ca/">Arieanna</a> that I'd met at yesterday's keynote. When she explained that she had 17 blogs, including ones for Lindsay Lohan and Hillary Duff&#8212;both of whom she apparently <em>hates</em>&#8212;I realized why I might have detected a wry little twist of the eyebrow from her yesterday when it was clear that I'd never heard of her before.
</p>

<p>
We both rather enjoyed the session, especially Heather Armstrong's part, but we ended up leaving about 15 minutes early because the room got so freaking hot. Instead we risked getting serious sunburns by sitting by the pool and sticking our feet in the water.

Is it time for cocktails yet?

<h3 class="title">Eventually, There Will Be an Update</h3>

<p>
Hi, yes, I'm back from BlogHer (after a few flight delays in Denver that caused me to miss saying goodnight to Austen), and I hope to write up a postmortem in the next couple days. Austen also turned 20 months yesterday, so I need to summarize the past month in parenthood as well. Luckily, I've already sort of done all the photo bits with my recap of our busy pre-BlogHer weekend, so I'll just need to review the developmental milestones. (Which reminds me... weren't we due for another visit with the pediatrician about now?)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the updates will be a bit late because I'm (a) trying to get caught up on my buglist after missing a day of work on Friday, (b) sorting through my feelings about BlogHer, and (c) not sure I kept track of any of Austen's developments in the past month. In the meantime, here are my photos from BlogHer:
