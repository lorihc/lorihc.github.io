<h3 class="title">Eventually, There Will Be an Update</h3>

<p>
Hi, yes, I'm back from BlogHer (after a few flight delays in Denver that caused me to miss saying goodnight to Austen), and I hope to write up a postmortem in the next couple days. Austen also turned 20 months yesterday, so I need to summarize the past month in parenthood as well. Luckily, I've already sort of done all the photo bits with my recap of our busy pre-BlogHer weekend, so I'll just need to review the developmental milestones. (Which reminds me... weren't we due for another visit with the pediatrician about now?)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the updates will be a bit late because I'm (a) trying to get caught up on my buglist after missing a day of work on Friday, (b) sorting through my feelings about BlogHer, and (c) not sure I kept track of any of Austen's developments in the past month. In the meantime, here are my photos from BlogHer:

<p>Howdy. I enjoyed meeting you at BlogHer. I've been consuming your hockey journal (up to pg 54) and have occasionally recognized some people.</p>

<p>I have a few hockey photos up at my Flickr account (Karianna) but some of the best are in a physical journal filed in my living room. Perhaps I should digitize it... hmmmm...</p>

<p>Anyway - I look forward to continuing to read more!</p>

<p>It was great meeting you, too -- wish we'd had more time to talk about hockey. :) I also wish I'd printed more of my early hockey photos, as you did, since I lost so many in <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/02/my_entire_web_e.html">the great rm -r debacle</a>. I'm now more careful about backing up everything I put online.</p>

<p>If you ever get around to scanning your hockey journal, you should definitely post the photos to Flickr -- I'd love to see them.</p>

<p>Hope to cross paths with you again sometime (maybe you'd be interested in playing with us -- the Spitfire, I mean -- next time we go to Vancouver?).<br />

<p>Yes! If I am not too bad. </p>

<p>I've been playing since 1993, but it has been quite "off and on" because of pregnancies (2) and jobs and moving and stuff. So I don't play like someone who has been playing for 13 years!</p>

<p>I have never been to Vancouver, and would love to go. I went to the big Brampton Women's Tourney a few times; that was a blast.</p>

<p>As soon as I recover a bit more from BlogHer, I think I'll scan that hockey journal... :)</p>
