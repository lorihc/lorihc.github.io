<h3 class="title">Yeah, So, Day 2</h3>

<p>
I realized that I haven't blogged at all today, which is probably a good sign&#8212;it means that I'm actually out socializing and interacting and watching presentations rather than hiding behind my computer. This is really the first session that I've felt like I could listen partway while blogging at the same time.
</p>
<p>
I had a pretty nice time at the cocktail party last night, talking with old friends and making new ones. (For those of you who read about my anxiety over whether or not to drink, I ended up having half a glass of wine, followed by a glass of milk.) I also ended up staying up a bit too late, but whatever, I enjoyed all the conversation and I'm not sleeping well right now anyway.

</p>

<p>
This morning I'd intended to go to the Mommy Blogging session, even though that term is making me increasingly nauseous, but just as it was getting started Al called. I made my way outside to take the call, and when I poked my head back into the room afterwards, it was completely full. I figured I'd go see Maggie's session on Is the Next Martha Stewart a Blogger?, and boy, did that turn out to be cool. Maggie, who was moderating, made some fabulous points, as did the panelists. Maggie's got an idea that women need to talk more about money&#8212;how much they make, how much they charge for their services, how much they pay for help, etc.&#8212;and I really think she's right. So many women give their talents away for free because they either don't know what to charge or don't think their services are worth charging for. If we get together and talk about these things, we gain leverage. Think about it, my fellow women.
</p>

<p>
After Maggie I had lunch with Jeanne and Suzanne and met Suebob from <a href="http://redstapler23.blogspot.com/">red stapler</a>, and then Jeanne and I flipped a coin to decide whether to go to From Here to Autonomy or Let's Talk About Sex. It was heads, so we went to From Here to Autonomy. We were sitting in the back, so it took me a minute to realize that one of the speakers was the <a href="http://www.blogaholics.ca/">Arieanna</a> that I'd met at yesterday's keynote. When she explained that she had 17 blogs, including ones for Lindsay Lohan and Hillary Duff&#8212;both of whom she apparently <em>hates</em>&#8212;I realized why I might have detected a wry little twist of the eyebrow from her yesterday when it was clear that I'd never heard of her before.
</p>

<p>
We both rather enjoyed the session, especially Heather Armstrong's part, but we ended up leaving about 15 minutes early because the room got so freaking hot. Instead we risked getting serious sunburns by sitting by the pool and sticking our feet in the water.

Is it time for cocktails yet?

<p>Well...first I must tell you that I've been cheating on you with Dooce! I hit her link on your blog a while back and have been reading it ever since - she's hysterical!<br />
So, secondly...she's posted two photos of you in her collection of pics from BlogHer. I don't know...I just thought it was so cool!</p>

<p>I think you're probably looking at Heather Champ's photostream (she's the one being licked in this photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heather/200036398/).">http://www.flickr.com/photos/heather/200036398/).</a> We spent more time together than Heather Armstrong and I did. :)</p>

<p>Oh, I'm LOVING the purple.</p>

<p>And, waiting for the post-mortem. Seems like you had a decent time, though.</p>

<p>Thanks! I did have a good time, yes -- I'm just trying to figure out how to write about it. As <a href="http://www.agirlandaboy.com/journal/archives/001099.html">Leah</a> said, there's a lot of self-censorship involved. Funny how inclined we are to censor ourselves when we know that there are real people with real feelings on the other side of the screen. </p>

<p>Quick preview: I'm glad I went. I had some great conversations, made some new friends, got to hang with old friends I rarely see, met (and really liked!) a few people I'd wanted to meet for a long time, and had some ideas for technical sessions to pitch for next year. I also came home with a slightly icky feeling that's hard to explain, and that's where the post-mortem writer's block is coming from.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, you're right...wrong Heather! Oh well, it was more about seeing your lovely face someplace new on the Internet. Aaron said to me, "You know, YOU could put YOUR face on the Internet, too!" He just doesn't get it...</p>

<p>:D :D There were a few nice photos of  me -- and many more taken that I haven't seen yet. So many women, so many cameras! I will happily put your face on the Internet next time I see you... which was almost on Sunday. It was so hot in Denver that they had to unload fuel, cargo, and passengers in order for the plane to take off, but I was one of the ones who made the flight. When they announced that they'd be bumping 17 people, I told Al, "well, I'm just going to leave it up to the universe and not sweat it. I figure if I get bumped, I'll just have dinner with Josie!"<br />

<p>What fun to meet you! Great photos (including the one I'm in), BTW. And thanks for making the very first comment on my blog. I'll be checking in here often.</p>
