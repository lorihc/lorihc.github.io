<h3 class="title">I'm Just Antisocial</h3>

<p>
Eson asked in a comment on the shoes post, "what is this BlogHer that you and others talk so much about, and why not want to go?", and I was in the middle of replying to the comment when I decided that really, this demanded an entire post.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://blogher.org/about-blogher-conference-06">BlogHer</a> is a conference for women bloggers (though men are of course invited, too). The idea is to get together and talk about blogging, learn from each other's experiences, get some technical tips, and, probably most importantly, meet the bloggers we read. I obviously do want to go&#8212;I signed up and paid for the conference, after all&#8212;but I'm just feeling a little freaked about about having to socialize. I usually manage OK when I get out in social situations (well, most of the time), but I get all angsty and stressed out ahead of any social event, and I usually have to be shoved out the door and locked out of the house so I don't just put on my jammies and crawl into bed.
</p>

<p>
If my dear friend and former roommate of five years, Pat, were still alive, she could testify to how many times she put a boot to my back and forced me out of our Arlington, VA apartment (and also how many times she heard me whine from the other side of the door, "oh, <em>ohkaaaay.</em> I guess I'll go <em>have a good time.</em>") For the record, I usually *did* have a good time, but that fact never decreased my anxiety or reluctance to leave the house. Heck, half the time I didn't socialize at all while out; I'd just listen to the band and try to preserve a bubble of personal space around me. Knowing that I didn't really <em>have</em> to talk to anyone also didn't decrease the anxiety, though, so you can imagine what knowing that I really <em>do</em> have to talk to people (if I want to get my money's worth, and if my stated main reason for wanting to go to BlogHer&#8212;to meet the bloggers I read&#8212;is really true) at BlogHer is doing to me.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't kidding when I said that there were probably zillions of other introverts who signed up for BlogHer in a moment of self-delusion. I actually think there are tons of us. In fact, I think that blogging probably appeals most to people who have an internal monologue going all the time, but who don't necessarily want to talk to other people (or who don't particularly <em>like</em> other people most of the time). I bet I'm not the only one who'd rather send an e-mail than pick up the phone (and who answers phone messages with e-mails whenever possible). 
</p>

<p>
Also, I think that even many of the blog celebrities wonder whether anyone will really like them in person (or, if they're at least sure of their audience's adoration, they may wonder *why* everyone really likes them). I don't know if this is a woman thing or a blogger thing, or whether it's neither, or perhaps both (maybe this is something we can talk about while drinking around the hotel pool), but I suspect we're all of us a bit nervous. Maybe everyone else is nervous for different reasons than I am, but I suspect they're nervous nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
Me, I'm nervous for all the reasons I outlined in the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/07/blogher_panic_s.html">BlogHer Panic Sets In</a> post (though to be honest, I've been feeling pretty good in the body image department lately, and anyone who thinks my ass is fat or my hair is dorky can go to hell <span style="font-size:smaller">but please don't stare at the zits adjacent to my approaching-middle-age wrinkles</span>), and for a few that I didn't mention in that post, namely:
</p>

<ol>
<li>If I drink at the evening cocktail parties, will I get drunk and feel crappy and then waste an entire day of the conference with day-after depression? (This is one of the reasons I rarely drink anymore: the next day depression can be CRUSHING.)</li>
<li>If I just have a glass of wine or a foofoo cocktail, will it throw my body into sugar shock and make me irritable (and once again a slave to sugar cravings)? I don't want to go back to that.</li>
<li>Will the cocktail parties by the pool be any fun if I don't drink?</li>
<li>Will I spend the cocktail parties by the pool fruitlessly trying to chat up people who look more lonely and lost than I do, being shrugged off by interesting people, and then just going back to my room to call Al, as I did at DevCon in 2002?</li>
<li>Will I be able to glean any useful information for a project at work/take any useful notes for said project and still be able to interact with other BlogHers? This worries me because I want to strike the right balance between work and play. What if I spend so much time taking notes that I don't actually <em>participate</em>? (This is my usual MO: Blog about or photograph the proceedings rather than participate in them.) Or, less likely, what if I'm having such a good time whooping it up with my new BlogHer friends that I don't collect any useful info for work?</li>
<li>Is the 6:30am flight to SFO, followed by a full day in the office, followed by a two-hour Caltrain ride to San Jose, followed by two days of BlogHer, followed by a 7:30am flight from SJC back to Philadelphia (via Denver, I think) overambitious? Am I going to be too exhausted to do anything fun while I'm at the conference, or worse, to handle work/home responsibilities when I get back?</li>
<li>Am I going to miss anything fun on Thursday night, while I'm riding the Caltrain down to SJC? (This concern is probably laughable, given all my other concerns about being social. :)</li>
</ol>

<p>
So there they are: my anxieties laid bare. Incidentally, I think this will be the first conference I've attended in a long, long time where I was not speaking in at least one session. Although I've gotten quite good at giving technical presentations on subjects I'm passionate about, I'm glad I don't have to deal with the feedback from the audience, both immediate (I had a woman cry in a JavaScript course I was giving once) and after the fact (I tend to take the comment forms to heart). I do feel like something's missing, however, knowing I don't have to get all my PowerPoint slides (or, more likely, my HTML facsimilies of PowerPoint slides) and handouts in order before I go. I just have to make sure I have all the computer equipment I need for that day in the office, plus my camera, memory cards, power cables, extra batteries, etc. Egads, add another anxiety: how am I going to fit all that crap into my backpack?

<p>To me, being antisocial is an argument amongst you and you, doesn't mean your crazy and neither am I, because as far as introverts go we are one in the same. Separating the intros and extros is an argument in itself. Might sound clishe enough, but It's the truth. One thing I've learned is if anyone makes you feel down about something you say or do, It's probably because you felt down in general before you said or did so. It does NOT mean you were wrong, it just means balance yourself. "Some people's thoughts and 1st impressions of you last as long as a school term" (as in people think a rumor is true, but two years after graduation they realize who you truly are after they have grown). In short, childish is a 1st impression as it relates to you and what it really means about you. Think and act freely, You'll do fine, trust me, I and all introverts promise. Lol, so BlogHer and Blog him, celebrity or simple,introvert or extrovert. It's not a just cause scenario.      </p>

<p>My experience with alcohol and sugar sensitivity is that I can usually handle a drink, as long as I've eaten a good, proteiny meal immediately prior.  You just don't want the alcohol to be the only thing swirling around your system.  YMMV, of course.</p>

<p>And it's better to avoid things with extra sugar, like any cocktail made with simple syrup, or anything mixed with fruit juice.</p>

<p>That's what I suspected about the alcohol -- perhaps margaritas are better than pina coladas. ;) I did try a glass and a half of wine (the first alcohol since I gave up sugar) while we were in Maine, and the only reason I felt confident doing it was because I was eating shrimp cocktail and steamed mussels (i.e., lots of protein) at the time. I did wake up a bit cranky the next day, but after walk and eggs for breakfast, I was fine. (Plus, I knew that I might be cranky, so I didn't spin out of control.) Good to know about your experience; it gives me more confidence. Plus, I can always decide on a selzer when I get there.</p>
