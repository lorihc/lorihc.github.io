<h3 class="title">BlogHer Panic Sets In</h3>

<p>
As I was getting dressed for my walk this morning, it occurred to me that <a href="http://blogher.org/about-blogher-conference-06" target="a8_win">BlogHer</a> is only three weekends away... and I totally panicked. My first thought was, "I DON'T WANT TO GO," and then the following internal conversation ensued:
</p>
<p>
<strong>me: </strong>You <em>do too</em> want to go.<br />
<strong>me: </strong>No, really, I don't. We just got back from Maine! That's enough traveling.<br />
<strong>me: </strong>You're just chicken. You don't want to meet new people, you big pussy.<br />
<strong>me: </strong>It's true, I'm chicken. I don't want to meet new people. I like the people I already know just fine; why complicate things? I object to the 'pussy' characterization, however.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure I'm not the only introvert who signed up for BlogHer in a moment of self-delusion. There are probably plenty of women who feel very confident when they're writing from behind a computer screen, plenty of women who feel like they know the bloggers whose names they regularly drop in conversation ("Mrs. Kennedy had this really interesting <a href="http://www.fussy.org/2006/06/sugar-shock.html">post on sugar</a> the other day... Alice&#8212;you know, Finslippy&#8212;had a <a href="http://finslippy.typepad.com/finslippy/2006/06/and_here_i_thou.html">nightmare experience with her babysitter</a> that totally brought back <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/06/i_want_to_vomit_1.html">bad</a> <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/06/antidote_1.html">memories</a>...Oh, no! Mainely Madge <a href="http://mainelymadge.typepad.com/mainely_madge/2006/06/fixation_follie.html">isn't going to make it to BlogHer!</a>..."), plenty of women who feel that blogs and blogging have saved their lives, plenty of women who are now scared shitless that no one will really like the not-as-funny, not-as-skinny, not-as-hip, not-as-connected, not-as-extroverted, and still-somewhat-acne-prone real person behind the keyboard. In fact, we might actually outnumber the blog celebrities at the conference. We'll probably never know the power of our numbers, however, because we'll each be hiding behind a different potted plant.
