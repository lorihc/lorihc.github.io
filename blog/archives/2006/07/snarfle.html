OK, it's almost 9pm, and I'm eating a room service caesar salad with shrimp. I'm stil exhausted, but I can now confirm that the nausea and headache were mostly due to hunger. The reason for having to re-type that last sentence four times? THAT'S due to the exhaustion.

I know nobody cares what I had for <s>lunch</s> dinner, but here it is anyway
</p>

<p>
The hotel room is fine, if a little dated/shabby. I can't decide if they're going for colonial, western rustic, or antique chic.

A $3.00 charge will be added to your bill upon consumption. Enjoy!<br />

I'll be carrying the Mac around with me tomorrow and seeing how it works as an actual laptop rather than a source-code building workhorse. I've already had reason to be glad I brought it: At 3:45pm my time (6:45pm EDT), Austen, Al and I experienced our first video iChat. Al hooked up the iSight to the Mac mini, and I used the one built-in to the MacBook, and we could see and hear each other so well it was like we were in the same room. Several of my co-workers came over to wave at the camera and see Austen in person&#8212;suddenly all the recent photos I loaded onto the Mac in case anyone asked what he looked like seem so irrelevant&#8212;and Austen and I clapped and pointed and laughed and smooched. His laugh came through loud and clear, and it was so nice to share his normal personality with my colleagues (last time he visited the office he'd just woken from a nap and wouldn't stop crying). 
</p>

<p>
The main reason I brought the Mac was so I could verify builds before checking in, of course, but it'll also be handy for downloading BlogHer photos (iPhoto will do the trick just fine, no proprietary camera software necessary), taking fun PhotoBooth shots, and now that I've had a taste of heaven and know what I've been missing, video chatting with Austen. I can't wait to wave at him again tomorrow!

<p>I am delighted to see a picture of your dinner, because I am ravenous at the moment, and a caesar salad with shrimp is one of my favorite things in the world.</p>
