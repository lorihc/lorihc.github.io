<h3 class="title">Yoooos! Yooooos!</h3>

<p>
I'm feeling a little guilty today because I hid the loves of Austen's life: his two blue shoes. He walked around the bedroom this morning calling "yoooos! yoooooos!", and he removed every single item from the white wire basket into which we usually toss the shoes at night, saying "no yooo" as each item was laid aside. It about broke my heart, and more than once I considered retrieving the blue shoes from the top of my closet, but I stuck it out.
</p>
<p>
His toes appeared to be bumping the end of those shoes, and he was starting to walk funny again&#8212;the way he did when his last pair of shoes became too tight&#8212;so taking them away seemed like the only thing to do. Luckily, although he answered "no" when I held up the black Pumas and said, "don't you want to wear these?", he did not object when Al put those same black Pumas on his feet. (Ironically, the infant-sized Pumas seem to run a little big, whereas the adult versions run at least a half size small.) I figure we can get a couple more weeks out of the black Pumas, at least, before we have to move to the size 7 green ones. Al is lobbying for a replacement pair of blue NBs, but the current pair was tough enough to find. I'll try, though.

<p>Hmmm, Have you tried Rugged Warehouse? They have a nice selection of shoes (at least where i currently live). Here, the kids section is a store of its own, and I'm pretty sure you could find something to the little ones liking. </p>

<p>I'd never heard of Rugged Wearhouse, so I looked it up online. No stores in Pennsylvania or New Jersey. Looks like the closest is in Wilmington, DE...</p>

<p>The good news is that when he woke up from his nap today, he started shouting for his yooos! yooooos! again -- and was excited when he found the black Pumas. As long as the blue NBs stay hidden, I think we're good for a while. :)</p>

<p>That's so sad! But so sweet, too!  Our Jeffrey just turned 14 months and so it's neat to read about Austen and see what's just around the corner for us. Good luck finding the new favorite shoes.</p>

I hope you have fun at BlogHer - I'm also a "behind the potted plant" person in large groups. With any luck they'll put the pots close enough together that y'all can talk to each other.</p>

<p>Sorry about that, I thought they would be a little more expanded than that. I have a question though, what is this BlogHer that you and others talk so much about, and why not want to go? </p>
