<h3 class="title">D:fiance</h3>

<p>
None of the hair products I currently own work <em>quite right</em> with my new haircut, so I decided to try <strong>d:fi</strong>, a product that a good friend's (ex-)girlfriend and <a href="http://www.fussy.org/2006/03/okay-so-i-guess-this-is-second.html">Mrs. Kennedy</a> happened to recommended in the same week back in March. I'm allergic to the vast majority of hair products, but tales of a pi&ntilde;a colada scent sounded appealing (one of the few products I can tolerate smells like pineapple Life Savers, and in my mind pi&ntilde;a colada = pineapple = no problem!), so I went in search of the stuff.
</p>
<p>
I finally located a salon in Philly that sells it last night, but it was closed, so I made another trip at lunchtime today (after using a standard three-weeks-plus-past-bleaching mix of the old Phyto Pro 8 gel&#8212;why, oh why, did they change the formula on this orange-rosemary-scented wonder?&#8212;and Laminates gel and letting my hair air-dry). When I returned with a jar of d:fi d:struct pliable molding creme (and some tuna salad, tomato and mozzarella salad, and an olive roll from DiBruno Bros.), I promptly stuck my finger into the pot.
</p>

<p>
I was expecting something hard and waxy, but my finger sunk all the way to the bottom of the jar; the consistency was more like warm canned frosting. I rubbed what clung to my finger as I removed it into the palm of my other hand and proceeded to smash it into my head. It's now 30 minutes later, and I have no hair product headache, I smell delicious, and my hair looks the way I want it to (really!). Mrs. Kennedy is right: shit is miraculous.

<p>d:fi d:struct is the *bomb*, for the hold & the yummy smell - and the fact that it washes right off your hands. (Thanks also for the tip about Laminates, which my hair also likes very much.)</p>

<p>I have wavy thick hair and without d:fi I would be a total fuzz ball..</p>

<p>I apply it to my towel dried hair, let it air dry, and it makes my hair much curlier and darker looking, with separated curls. The stuff is awesome. I have stocked up on 2 extra containers of it.</p>

<p>I want to try their Light Wax product also but haven't found it around town yet.</p>
