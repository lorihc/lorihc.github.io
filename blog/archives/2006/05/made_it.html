<h3 class="title">Made It!</h3>

<p>
I finally arrived at YVR, went through customs, grabbed my bag and stick off the oversize ramp, and picked up my rental car, and I was on my way to North Vancouver at 9:09pm local time last night. After a quick stop at the Safeway and a couple wrong turns (I was following a Google Maps route from memory), I made it to my hotel almost exactly an hour later.
</p>
<p>
I've already had my morning walk (though not my morning coffee) and a shower, and I'm about to go out exploring. I asked at the front desk for a good place for a photography nut to go poke around, he made a suggestion, and as soon as I get dressed, I'll grab my camera and go.
</p>

<p>
I noticed when I went out to the car this morning to get my hat out of my hockey bag that the bag has a huge gash along the seam at the bottom; luckily, everything I put in the bag seems to be accounted for, but I'll still need to get a new bag before I head home. :( Guess I'll be combing the hockey stores for a good bag rather than just picking up some sock tape at Canadian Tire...

<p>Complain to the airline.  They may well reimburse you for at least part of the cost of a new bag, since they damaged it.</p>

<p>It's OK about the bag; I'd been wanting a new one anyway, and I'm not that interested in arguing with the airline. :)</p>
