<h3 class="title">Questions For the Locals</h3>

<p>
<strong>Have you tried Out of the Blue @ 20th and Rittenhouse? </strong>If so, how's the food? The space looks modern and sparse yet somehow cozy, though not at all child-friendly. Al and I have been thinking about it as a possible date-night destination, and since date nights are rare, we don't want to waste one on a sub-par dining experience.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you have a massage therapist you like/would recommend? </strong>I'm looking for someone who isn't chatty; I'd rather not be talked to while I'm getting my knots worked out. I'd also prefer someone who isn't too new-agey, but who knows a thing or two about energy. FWIW, I found the massage therapist that I went to monthly in San Francisco at my gym, so I'm particularly open to therapists who specialize in sports massage or working with athletes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Do you have a chiropractor you like/would recommend? </strong>Here I'm looking for someone who's willing to listen, work with me, and explain what s/he's doing&#8212;but not talk too much. I'd like to avoid Gonstead practioners.
</p>

<p>
Please leave any recommendations in the comments, so others can see them, too. Thanks!

both pre- and post-natal, and a friend swears by the chiropractic care.</p>

<p>I notice the Balance office every time I walk down 20th Street and always wonder if it's worth going to. Thanks for the tip!<br />
