<h3 class="title">Deep Cove (and Deep Bruise)</h3>

<p>
Before heading out to Deep Cove (the suggestion of the guy at the front desk) this morning, I took some more photos of the bruise on my butt. I think this one shows the damage pretty well, as well as the migration of the bruise into the previously-swollen area just above my tailbone. I think you can also see the knob pretty clearly, even though this photo was taken head-on (or butt-on, as the case may be...).

</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Deep Cove was AMAZING. I should have followed my instincts and headed down there earlier; by arriving after 8am I managed to miss a bunch of seals playing close to the shore. If I'm up early enough tomorrow, I may go down there again. I'm uploading the photos I took to Flickr as we speak, so check the little thumbnails on the front page for the latest.
</p>

<p>
After taking lots of photos of the incredible mountain, water, and mist views, I followed the advice of one of the boat-rental employees and had breakfast at Honey's (actual name is Honey Doughnuts &amp; Goodies, and it's on the right side of Deep Cove Road as you come down toward Panorama Park). The cranberry-peach bran muffin was excellent&#8212;really bran-y and not too sweet&#8212;and the small decaf latte was smooth as silk. Honey's also serves eggs (the special today was eggs benedict), french toast, and waffles in addition to their tasty selection of baked goods. Sandwiches and soups are also available at lunch, though breakfast is served until 4pm.
</p>

<p>
I'll be heading out in search of a new hockey bag as soon as I'm done uploading photos. More later!

<p>No - that is NOT a picture of your butt...it is one of those horrible slides from high school biology class that shows a smoker's lung or something! Yikes! It was great talking to you as you wiled (sp? I found myself in Word trying to determine the correct spelling of that word...and it didn't help!) away your time at DIA. Glad to hear you're back home safely. Take care of that butt now, will ya?!?</p>

<p>Sadly, it *is* a picture of my butt. The colors have moved toward the red-yellow-brown end of the spectrum now, so I suspect it's healing. The knob is still there, though, and it's still painful to lie on my back. :-/</p>

<p>I had such a good time chatting with you while I was at the airport! Really, I shouldn't wait until I'm within 50 miles of you to dial your #.<br />
