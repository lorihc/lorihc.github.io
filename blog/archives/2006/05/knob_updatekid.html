<h3 class="title">Knob Update/Kid Update</h3>

<p>
The knob on my butt:
</p>
<ul>
<li>is getting bigger, not smaller.</li>
<li>has turned black at the bottom.</li>
<li>is very tender.</li>
<li>still looks like I'm trying to grow a third ass cheek.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The kid under my feet:
</p>
<ul>
<li>started saying "thank you" out loud yesterday.</li>
<li>now imitates us by shrieking "NOOOOOO" when he's about to do something he isn't supposed to do.</li>
<li>can say "ball", "PITsa" [pizza], and "pasta", among other things.</li>
<li>refers to every Sesame Street character, and the show itself, as "Elmo".</li>
<li>will point to Cookie Monster, Big Bird, and Oscar correctly if you say their names.</li>
<li>says "Elmo" and waves bye-bye at his bib (which might have Big Bird or Cookie Monster on it) when he's done eating.</li>
<li>learned how to go down the steps at the playground using only his feet/legs and without holding a handrail yesterday. Which is more than I can say for myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can't do that to people.  Geez. I saw that photo on your flickr account and thought that it was going to be an announcement of some sort and came directly here.  NOT SAYING THAT YOU HAVE A PREGNANT BELLY, but that angle/type of shot is so prevalent that it's what I immediately thought of.  Geez louise.</p>

<p>(Hope your knob recedes, btw.)</p>

<p>Sorry about that -- I actually had the same reaction when I saw the photo on Flickr! Hmmm... looks like my belly photos. And gah, even though I'm back to my pre-pregnancy weight, I look 13 weeks pregnant. Harrumph! </p>
