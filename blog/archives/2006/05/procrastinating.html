<h3 class="title">Procrastinating</h3>

<p>
I'm not sure why I have enough time to read through my old <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/blogger/blog_archive_detail.html">blogger archives</a>, buy a new webcam, revive (and redesign) the <a href="/blog/webcam.html">webcam archives</a> (formerly "the gallery of silly faces," now dubbed "a history of hair", though there are plenty of silly faces still in there), and otherwise procrastinate, but I don't have time to write about all the new words Austen has learned, the fact that my upper back is ABSOLUTELY KILLING ME, the list of things Austen has spilled this week, how going to bed earlier so I can get up and go for a walk ALONE in the mornings has changed my life, how much I've been missing <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/our_cat/index_fulltext.html">Annie</a> lately, Austen's long-overdue new shoes, or the last 5 hockey games I've played (not to mention the tournament I'll be attending at the end of this month), but there it is.
</p>
<p>
I'm reluctant to promise that a post about all the things I should've written about but haven't will be forthcoming this weekend, as I suspect my back is hoping for some time away from the three computers at my desk. I *did* manage to post all my photos of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/tags/intercourse/">our Saturday in Intercourse, PA</a> to Flickr, however, as promised.

<p>How sad about your kitty! I guess I was pretty preoccupied back then, what with a new baby, no sleep, and serious post-partum depression - I don't remember any of that.</p>

<p>Those photos are wonderful!</p>

<p>Yeah, both Al and I really miss Annie. I just looked through the pictorial again myself and found it very therapeutic -- it reminded me of all the great times we had with her, and how our relationship evolved in the four years I knew her. She really did prepare me for parenthood!</p>
