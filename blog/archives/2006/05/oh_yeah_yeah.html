<h3 class="title">Oh Yeah Yeah</h3>

<p>
I was planning on writing an entry this morning about how Austen doesn't just say "yes" and "no" anymore; instead he says "oh yeah yeah" and "no no no". I assumed that he'd gotten the "no no no" from a recent visit to Al's parents' house because that's what Al's dad said almost constantly when he was watching Austen: "no no no, no no no, no no no". (Actually, it sounded more like "nuh nuh nuh, nuh nuh nuh, nuh nuh nuh", which is a bit more gentle and non-specific than "NO NO NO".) Anway, what I was less sure of was where he'd gotten the "oh yeah yeah."
</p>
<p>
Before I could make it up to the computer this morning, I discovered the answer. Austen and I were in the kitchen getting breakfast and watching Elmo's World when I heard Elmo say, "oh yeah yeah". Well, duh, OF COURSE Austen learned to speak like Elmo: he watches Sesame Street very intently at least twice a day, and Elmo's World is by far his favorite segment. I just hope he doesn't start referring to himself in the third person.
