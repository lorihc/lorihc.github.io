<h3 class="title">Boots!</h3>

<p>
Ratphooey has got me hooked on the idea of boots, and I'm now considering whether I want to splurge on a pair of Steven Lanaas. The question is, <a href="http://www.zappos.com/images/720/7203553/985-202034-p.jpg">brown</a> or <a href="http://www.zappos.com/images/720/7203553/1733-202033-p.jpg">black</a>?

<p>Brown: they look less severe.  Plus, if you get sick of them you can dye them black.</p>

<p>I like the black - does my vote cancel out Jack's? :)<br />

<p>I'd say brown...it's almost spring (though it may not feel like it) and that light brown color would be perfect for it :)</p>

<p>I'm leaning toward brown, and if they fit well and I seem to wear them a lot, maybe I'll get the black ones, too. Now I just need to work up the gumption to actually order them! Maybe I'll wait til the end of the month and see how much money's left in my spending account...</p>

<p>Neither, you should get a pair with a bit more of a heel on it.  The color doesn't matter, they're allllll good.  :)</p>

<p>I'm catching up on your site since I've been busy (to explain why I'm late to the party on this posting). Did you get the boots? If so, what color?</p>

<p>I kept meaning to provide an update on this -- thanks for the reminder, Sally. I ended up spotting the boots (on sale! for less than 1/2 the price of Zappos.com!) at Macy's, so I tried them on. When I did, I understood what some of the reviewers on Zappos meant when they said the boots felt a half size larger than marked... and yet, they were true to width. Since I have wide feet, they weren't a fabulous fit. Also, while they *are* adjustable at the top (via the buckle), they weren't quite wide enough for my calves. So! The search for an interesting, ass-kicking, comfortable-to-wear boot continues. What I learned from this experiment was:<br />
1. I probably need something wider at the calf (14-15").<br />
2. I definitely want something taller (again, 14-15").<br />
3. I think Kevin's right when he says I need something with more of a heel. I want comfort, but what's the point of a boot if you don't look either sexy or like Tank Girl?</p>
