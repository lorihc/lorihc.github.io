<h3 class="title">If Only The Streets Department Cared Enough About Noise Pollution to Budget for a Few of These</h3>

<p>
Via <a href="http://www.powazek.com/" target="a8_win">Derek</a>: Finally, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cars/sound-cameras-give-tickets-to-loud-car-stereos-161488.php" target="a8_win">a way to stick it to the neighbor</a> who routinely parks his SUV-with-the-oversensitive-alarm illegally&#8212;such that it sticks out into traffic and is jostled by SEPTA buses rumbling by. I've been listening to this ridiculous alarm day after day and night after night for over two years now, and testy notes left under his windshield wipers have done nothing more than set the alarm off an additional time (when I said the alarm was sensitive, I wasn't kidding). I've seriously considered throwing a rock through his window or slashing his tires, which would be more gratifying (and probably more productive) than calling the police or the Streets Department, but I'm too law-abiding to do actual property damage. Oh, that I weren't.

<p>Have you tried calling the police?  Just curious about how they would respond (or not).</p>

<p>I have not. In researching "noise complaint" on the Phila.gov website, I came across this document: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.phila.gov/health/units/ams/pdf/noise.pdf">http://www.phila.gov/health/units/ams/pdf/noise.pdf</a></p>

<p>which seems to indicate that my lousy neighbor is not in violation of the law because his alarm does not sound for more than 15 continuous minutes. Never mind that it sounds for about 1-3 minutes every couple hours throughout the night; this is not considered annoying enough.</p>

<p>This document also corrects my assumption that noise complaints are handled by the Streets Department or police; rather, they're handled by the Air Management Services division of the Department of Public Health. Huh, you learn something new every day.</p>

<p>check again - section III (E) i and section V (C) - the parts about operation of sirens (only during emergency conditions!) and motor vehicles (no sounding of horn or warning devices unless real warning is required). I think you should call the police and the dept of public health!</p>
