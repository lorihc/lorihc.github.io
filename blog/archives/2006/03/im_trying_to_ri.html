<h3 class="title">I'm Trying to Rise Above This, But I Can't</h3>

<p>
I'm trying hard not to wish that <a href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/billnapoli/" target="a8_win">Bill Napoli</a> could be "brutalized and raped, sodomized as bad as you can possibly make it." I'm trying hard to find only love and compassion for this man who obviously has no love or compassion for any woman who is not "a virgin[,]... religious[,]....[and] plann[ing] on saving her virginity until she was married." I'm trying hard to pray for this man&#8212;who I deeply, firmly believe has, like any other man, no right to make any judgement whatsoever about the righteousness or worthiness of a woman who needs or wants an abortion&#8212;that he find the the enlightenment to KEEP HIS FUCKING TRAP SHUT on subjects that, unless my vengeful side wins out and somehow influences the universe to get medieval on <a href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/billnapoli/" target="a8_win">Bill Napoli</a>'s ass (and somehow impregnate him in the process), he will never know anything about.

<p>Bill is a sick and disturbed man, living in a sick and disturbed country. Let's hope they both get well soon.</p>

<p>What an ignorant f___. I just hope that he is single with no daughters. If not, I hope that they are never forced to carry a child that was conceived from a sickening, violent act. I admire women who choose that path and lovingly accept the child. Choose being the operative word. At 44, I remember when they legalized abortions in 1970. I also remember the horrid results of back alley abortions that continued throughout the 70's even after legalization.</p>
