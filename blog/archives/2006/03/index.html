<h3 class="title">Blogging Block</h3>

<p>
I am feeling so overwhelmed by the backlog of blog posts waiting to be written that every time I get a chance to actually write one, I end up reading other blogs instead of writing in my own. So yes, I am WELL AWARE that I owe y'all (and myself) a Vacation Summary, Part 2 and an Austen @ 15 Months update, not to mention various and sundry other observations that have been piling up on little slips of paper around the house.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, in case you were wondering, those Vanilla Sunshine Cupcakes at Starbucks are actually pretty good. Good cake, good frosting, perfect little daisy-shaped sugar disc on top. Yummy.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and the main reason that I haven't had the time or inclination to write: I'm swamped with work. Yes, WORK! And for the most part, I'm loving it. I feel so lucky to be working full-time FROM HOME, and to have Hannah coming every day. It's good for me, it's good for Austen, it's good for all of us. More on this topic later, I'm sure, but to summarize: 1. Things are good. 2. I'm very lucky.
</p>

<p>
That is all. For now.
</p>

<h3 class="title">You Call This Warm?</h3>

<p>
I just ate a Dove Promises square (milk chocolate, because that's all that's left here on my desk, and I'm too lazy to go downstairs and raid the cupboard with the dark chocolate ones in it). The text on the inside of the wrapper said, "Feel the promise of a warm day."

<p>
I find it especially ironic that the Dove Promise in question was from a bag I bought at half price because it was labeled for the holidays. The December holidays.

<h3 class="title">15 Month Update (and Vacation Summary, Part 2)</h3>

<p>
I think I'll remember month 15 as the one in which Austen learned to sign &quot;please&quot; and say &quot;no&quot;. These two additions to his vocabulary have made a tremendous difference in his ability to communicate his wants and needs; when he points up at the kitchen counter and says, &quot;uhhn,&quot; we can now hold up any items in the area one at a time (me: &quot;sippy cup?&quot; A: &quot;no.&quot; me: &quot;banana?&quot; A: &quot;no.&quot; me: &quot;glass of water?&quot; A: &quot;no.&quot; me: &quot;you want me to put on my glasses?&quot; A: [smiles and makes sign for &quot;please&quot;]) and know for sure when we've hit on the one he wants. Of course, he also answers &quot;no&quot; to lots of questions to which he should really be answering yes, such as &quot;did you poop?&quot;
</p>

</p>
<p>
As I mentioned in the first (and so far only) installment of our  <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2006/02/vacation_summar_1.html">Vacation Summary</a>, Austen also knows how to say &quot;grandpa&quot;; we clearly heard him say it at least twice while we were in Hawaii. I also heard him say it the other night when he was looking through the latest issue of TIME magazine (Austen loves to read magazines, especially TIME and Martha Stewart Living). He'd gotten to the last page, which had an ad that showed a man of about 60 with close-cropped gray hair in a suit. He made the &quot;I know that guy!&quot; sound (it's similar to the &quot;I want that!&quot; uhhn,  but with a different inflection) and pointed to the guy in the suit. I don't think Austen's ever seen my dad in a suit, but I suspected that that was who he thought the guy was. &quot;Who's that?&quot; I asked. &quot;Grandpa,&quot; he said softly, staring lovingly at the photo. &quot;No, that's not grandpa, but it does kind of look like him,&quot; I said. Oddly, he doesn't usually say &quot;grandpa&quot; when photos of my dad (or Al's) come up in our Mac screensaver rotation, but he does make the &quot;I know that guy!&quot; sound. I guess you have to ask him &quot;who's that?&quot; to get &quot;grandpa.&quot;

</p>
<p>
I'll also remember month 15 as the one in which Austen had his first ear infection. It happened  in Hawaii, and our first indication that something was really wrong was when Austen woke up on Wednesday morning at 3:30 am with a raging fever. I'd noticed he was a little pink (and warm) the night before and figured that despite our best efforts to keep him covered with clothing, sunscreen, and a hat, he'd gotten a sunburn while we were out whale watching. I'd given him some Tylenol in case it would help, and put him to bed as usual at 7:30. When he woke up with the fever at 3:30, his skin was a fiery red, and I was <em>sure</em> I'd been a rotten, irresponsible parent and totally sunburned my child. We were a little panicked; Austen had never had a fever (or a sunburn) before, and we were very far from home. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Luckily Al realized that with the time difference, our pediatrician's office would be open at that hour, so we called. The nurse who called back seemed to ignore my news about being out in the sun (maybe it's difficult to imagine getting a sunburn when there's 2' of snow where you are) and asked if he was pulling his ears or acting cranky. I said, &quot;well, he's screaming now, but I suspect that's because it's 4am and he's burning up.&quot; She suggested that we go get some Children's Motrin (it's apparently better than Tylenol at controlling fevers), and while at the store, to pick up a thermometer. &quot;It'll help put your mind at ease, for one thing,&quot; she said, &quot;and it'll also help you figure out if the fever's going down. If it's not, or if you notice any behavioral changes&#8212;lethargy, etc.&#8212;then you should take him to a doctor.&quot;
</p>
<p>
We drove to Safeway and got an ear thermometer and some Motrin; the reading was 103.5. We dosed Austen with Motrin and let him sleep in the bed with us for the next couple hours, and when he woke his fever had broken. He also wasn't nearly as red/pink, which should have tipped us off that this wasn't a sunburn we were dealing with. So anyway, we went on with the day as scheduled and drove to Mama's Fish House in Paia, where we had an amazing lunch (with even more amazing views). After lunch Al and Austen played in the sand on the beach, and then we drove around Kahului and Wailuku for a while in a futile attempt to find malasadas. (Sweet Treats had closed, and The Home Maid Bakery only serves them from 5:30-9:30am and from 4-10pm; we arrived at 3pm.)

</p>
<p>
When we arrived back at Kapalua around 4:30 or 5, we noticed that Austen was really hot again. We took his temperature with our handy ear thermometer... and promptly flipped out when the reading was 104.5. I knew from reading nj and Morrisa's account of Miranda's high fever (I can't find the entry now, but it was when Miranda was less than a year old, I think) that brain damage wasn't necessarily imminent, so I was able to calm Al down a little. We called the Doctors on Call number and got the office in Ka'anapali (for some reason the one at Kapalua was closed that day), and we made an appointment for 6:20. We dosed Austen with some more Motrin and then headed out the door, figuring there was no harm in getting there early. On the way there I called Morrisa to see if she had any advice;  she confirmed that while there was no need to panic, we were doing the right thing by going to see the doctor.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Getting to the doctor's office early did indeed work in our favor; we were seen a little before 6, and the young doctor (who told us he had a 17 month-old) quickly figured out that Austen's left ear was infected. (He also wasn't the least bit skeptical about our 104.5 reading, thank god&#8212;most doctors seem to think that the only readings that matter are the ones taken in their offices&#8212;and was pleased to see that the Motrin was already working, as the reading he got was 101.5.) He told us we could alternate Motrin and Tylenol (e.g., Motrin at noon, Tylenol at 4pm, Motrin at 6pm, Tylenol at 10pm, etc.) to keep the fever down, and he prescribed 10 days of antibiotics... plus a re-check on Friday to make sure Austen was OK to fly home that night. (He was, and he loved the strawberry flavor of the medicine; by day 3 he was bringing me the bottle and dropper first thing in the morning, so he never missed a dose. :)
</p>
<p class="pictureP">

</p>
<p>
Month 15 was also when I returned to work full-time. (I actually started on Austen's 14-month birthday, Jan. 30.) Obviously our arranged-last-August Hawaiian vacation interrupted work for a couple weeks, but the rest of the month went surprisingly well. Austen knows that I'm working&#8212;he's just as sad when I head upstairs to my office as when Al leaves out the front door in the mornings&#8212;but he really seems to like playing with Hannah all day, and of course he's always excited to see me when I come down for a hug break or some food. I miss the days of running errands when no one else was at the mall or the grocery store (now I go on weekends with all the other working people), but I'm glad to be working again, and I'm especially glad to have help. Al, Hannah, and I form a little child-rearing triumverate now; I don't feel like I'm shouldering most or all of the responsibility myself.
</p>
<p>
On the food front, Austen is still a really good eater. He eats just about everything, and he likes to graze. This month I introduced him to Jell-O, and though he was skeptical of the bright orange wiggly mass at first,  it's now among his favorite treats. He especially loves it with fruit trapped inside. He also went wild for strawberries (organic, of course) this month, eating 5 or 6 of them at a time. Just to be silly I squirted some whipped cream on the one he had in his hand once, and he's now a total whipped-cream junkie. He begs to have whipped cream squirted on his hand, and more often than not he plays with it for a little while before he eats it (if he eats it at all; in the photo on the left below, he's smeared it in his hair like mousse). 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Yesterday morning he begged me to squirt some whipped cream on his hand, so I gave him a small squirt. He pointed at the can, which I'd put back on the counter, and made the sound for &quot;I want that!&quot; I said, &quot;I already gave you some. You don't need any more.&quot; At which point he made the sign for &quot;please&quot;... and smeared the whipped cream all over his chest. The look on his face when he realized he'd done it was priceless&#8212;a sitcom moment if ever I've seen one. I, of course, busted out laughing, which brought out the ham in Austen. He smiled devilishly and rubbed the whipped cream all over his stomach.
</p>
<p>
Finally, it looks like Austen shares my love of cozy little nooks; that triangular space between the baby gate and the wall at the base of the kitchen-living room stairs has become his favorite. It's where he goes whenever I give him a big enough piece of food to keep him busy for a while, and sometimes he just sits there when he wants some time to himself.

<h3 class="title">Boots!</h3>

<p>
Ratphooey has got me hooked on the idea of boots, and I'm now considering whether I want to splurge on a pair of Steven Lanaas. The question is, <a href="http://www.zappos.com/images/720/7203553/985-202034-p.jpg">brown</a> or <a href="http://www.zappos.com/images/720/7203553/1733-202033-p.jpg">black</a>?

<h3 class="title">More Good Baked Goods From Starbucks</h3>

<p>
The other day I was having a very specific craving (but then, when are my cravings not very specific?) for a cakey-but-very-dense brownie with a fudgy ganache icing. I didn't want just a brownie, and I didn't want just a frosted browie; I wanted a dense, cakey brownie with <em>fudgy ganache icing</em>.
</p>

<p>
I didn't actually think I was going to find such a confection, but upon stopping in at Starbucks to look for a black and white cookie*, I discovered that they're now featuring a mint brownie that, aside from the addition of a layer of mint fiIling, exactly fit the bill. The extra mint did not inhibit my enjoyment of the dense, cakey brownie or the fudgy ganache icing in the least, and I am now happily eating my second one in three days.
</p>

<p>
On the cupcake front, Al decided to try the chocolate companion to the Vanilla Sunshine Cupcake and immediately pronounced it "too chocolatey." To me this is an oxymoron, but after eating the remainder I can kind of see his point: If I wanted this much chocolate in a baked good, I'd probably opt for a brownie. I suspect the chocolate shavings on top of the chocolate icing were the tipping point, but I should admit that I have something of a bias against chocolate cupcakes with chocolate icing in general. I'd rather have the aforementioned brownie or a slice of chocolate cake than a chocolate cupcake. To me, "cupcake" implies "vanilla cupcake with buttercream icing", or at the very least, "buttercream icing". When desperate for a baked good I will accept a vanilla cupcake with chocolate icing or a chococolate cupcake with chocolate icing, but in my heart I will pine for the white-on-white version.
</p>

<p>
*The story behind the search for a black and white cookie has to do with the less-than-efficient system for ordering take-out items at Artie's Delicatessen (home of my favorite black and white cookies) in NYC. The procedure is that you tell the guy behind the counter what you want, and then you move over to the cashier and tell her what you ordered. Unfortunately, there are no cross-checks in the system; if the counterman didn't hear you properly and the cashier does, you could end up paying for one thing and getting another. This is how I ended up paying for two black and white cookies and getting only one, thus leaving a one-black-and-white-cookie void. The one I did get, of course, was delicious.

<h3 class="title">Requiring E-mail Addresses From Commenters</h3>

<p>
I've re-enabled the option to require valid e-mail addresses from commenters, so if you've already been approved as a commenter via <a href="http://www.typekey.com/">TypeKey</a> but haven't provided an e-mail address, you may be asked to enter one. 
</p>



<p>
Why am I doing this? Honestly, it isn't to prevent comment spam (or to invite it for those ponying up e-mail addresses); rather, it's because I often like to respond personally to commenters, and it drives me nuts to write a long response only to find that I'm replying to myself.
</p>

<p>
Of course, if turning this option on makes things go horribly, horribly wrong, I'll probably turn it back off again. &lt;sigh&gt;

<h3 class="title">Trixie Tracker!</h3>

<p>
It's kinda too late for Austen (although the sleep telemetry might still be interesting), but the <a href="http://www.trixietracker.com/" target="a8_win">Trixie Tracker</a> has FINALLY launched. If you're about to have a baby and you're (a) anal, (b) technophilic, (c) a fan of Edward Tufte, or (d) all of the above, get yourself over there and sign up. It's way better than writing everything on little index cards!

*Seriously, Benmac has totally outdone himself. The long wait was worth it.

<h3 class="title">Yeeeesssss</h3>

<p>
So shortly after I posted the 15 month update, Austen acquired a new behavior: a slow, exaggerated nod that means &quot;YES&quot;. He now signs &quot;please&quot; about half as much (i.e., only when he's asking for something, not answering a question about whether he wants something), but we can always teach him to put &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;please&quot; together later. For now it's just really gratifying to see him nod unambiguously when I ask him if he wants some yogurt or if he wants to play on the computer. He's also started responding with the correct answer when we ask him if he's pooped. (Not that I usually need to ask him, mind you; I can usually tell by the way he grunts or the way he smells.)
</p>


<p>
In not-so-positive news, I was shocked when I returned to work to find that the tendonitis that usually struck me only after long stretches of very intense work over a period of weeks had returned as well&#8212;with a vengeance, and almost immediately. I soon discovered the reason: I use those same muscles and tendons to hold Austen, especially when I'm putting him to bed at night. They were already being taxed pretty heavily, and adding 8-9 hours of computer work each day pushed them beyond their limit. I'm now stuck in that horrible RSI dilemma: How do I stop the pain when I can't stop using my arm? 
</p>
<p>
I'm going to try stretching frequently and changing my desk setup a bit, but I also need to change the way I carry Austen. He's going to have to get used to being on the left side (he prefers the right), and instead of me walking him around the room and then rocking him while standing next to the crib at night, we're now going to be sitting in a chair until he conks out. (The irony is that the more my arm hurts, the less I'm able to support Austen in the position he wants to be in, and the longer it takes for him to get to sleep... which makes my arm hurt more. It used to take 5-15 minutes to get to get him to sleep at night; in the past week, it's taken me 20-30, and twice I've had to call Al to take over when I just. couldn't. do it. any. more.) 
</p>
<p>
I'm hoping these small changes help, because I'm really not sure what else to do. I think some more regular exercise in general would help, but I find that after leaving Austen's room at night with my right forearm feeling like a throbbing, red-hot poker and my patience totally shot, I'm not inclined to go downstairs and do Pilates. Anyway, enough whining. Tops on my to-do list is to find some work-baby-exercise balance.
</p>
<p>
Tonight the work-baby balance wasn't going so well, as the meeting I was supposed to be in from 5pm to 6pm didn't <em>start</em> until 6:10, but when I did finally make it down to the basement to see Al and the Beaner, Austen was visibly thrilled. When he hasn't seen me for a while he likes to make&#8212;and keep&#8212;physical contact with me, I think to make sure I don't wander off again. Tonight I sat on the floor, and he stood behind me, walked around in front of me, flopped in my lap, knocked me over and sat on my head, kissed me, headbutted me, sat on my knee, stood with his hand on my shoulder, climbed onto my back... you name it. As long as some part of his body was making contact with mine, he was happy.
</p>
<p id="wasabi">
Part of his excitement in seeing me might have been because I walked in carrying the leftover sushi (two inari and one piece of California roll) from his and Al's dinner; he practically yanked the first inari out of my hand, and then tried to grab at the other pieces in the tray. I was able to fend him off by giving him a little of the rice from the California roll, and when we'd each finished our share of that piece, I gave some of the rice from the second inari. I was in the middle of taking a bite of that inari when he grabbed the entire wad of wasabi from the tray and stuffed it in his mouth. 
</p>
<p>
I yelled, &quot;no, buddy, that's too spicy!&quot;, but I had the tray and the inari in my hand, so I couldn't grab his hand before it reached his mouth. By the time I managed to put down the tray and the inari, he'd already bitten down. I scraped the green stuff out of his mouth when he opened it to scream, and when he realized that (a) Mommy tried to warn him, and (b) Mommy was now trying to help him (even though she was laughing hysterically at the same time), he chilled out. He did give me a &quot;what the hell WAS that, anyway???&quot; look, though, and his nose started running from the heat.
</p>
<p>
I was mostly laughing because the scene reminded me of one of my dad's favorite Lori Stories: namely, the one where I stuffed the scoop-of-butter nose from my IHOP Funny Face pancake straight into my mouth because I thought it was ice cream. (Hey, I was four or five at the time, and I'd never seen butter in anything but sticks and squirt bottles. I knew what a scoop of ice cream looked like, however, and that nose looked <em>exactly</em> like a miniature scoop of ice cream!) I figured out that I had a big wad of butter in my mouth at the same time my dad figured out why I'd just stuffed said butter into my mouth, and of course a fit of hysterical laughter ensued (on his part, not mine. I was just embarrassed, and a little confused.) Oh well, at least the butter didn't burn.

<h3 class="title">Things That Have Occurred to Me in the Past 24 Hours</h3>

<p>
I keep remembering new behaviors that Austen exhibited for the first time during his 15th month of life which I neglected to mention in my 15 month update (or anywhere else&#8212;I haven't been writing in my little bedside journal regularly lately, either). I figure I'd better record them somewhere before I forget, and here seems as good a place as any. The main three that have come to mind in the past 24 hours:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blowing raspberries ~ </strong>I think this started while we were in Hawaii. I've been blowing raspberries on Austen's cheeks, hands, feet, and belly forever, but one morning after Austen got in bed with us he blew a raspberry on my belly. It totally cracked me up, which of course encouraged him to do it again. It's now his favorite playing-with-mommy game after...</li>
<li><strong>Bellybutton! ~ </strong>Again, this is something I've been doing with Austen for a while: every time he touches my bellybutton (or I touch his), I shriek "BELLYBUTTON!" Usually he'll press three or four times in a row, and each press gets a "BELLYBUTTON!" shriek. What's changed recently is that he's now acutely aware of his own bellybutton. He can locate it right away, and he'll often alternate between pressing his and pressing mine. He also likes to cover mine up and then go hunting for it again.</li>
<li><strong>Knock, knock ~ </strong>Austen started closing doors on us months ago, and I'd always knock on the door and ask, "is Austen home?" before opening it up for him. Now whenever he closes a door, <em>he</em> knocks (and then either twiddles the knob himself or waits for me to open the door). He knocks whether he's the one inside the room or outside it&#8212;I guess he just assumes that a knock is the precursor to opening a door.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In other news, I am happy to report that though my tendonitis isn't improving yet, asking Al to move the Clipper chair into Austen's room so I could put him to sleep while sitting down turned out to be a Very Good Move. The bedtime routine is now back to 5-10 minutes instead of 20-30, and there's no additional stress being put on my arm (or my nerves). The shorter, less stressful routinue meant that I had the energy for Pilates tonight, and I think <em>that</em> is something that could make a positive difference in the tendonitis situation. I could feel all the knots in my back when I was doing the Rolling Like a Ball exercise, and I felt more relaxed after completing the 20-minute workout.
</p>

<p>
What isn't going to help my tendonitis is Super Tetris. I hooked up my old PowerMac 7500 to the monitor with which my employer was kind enough to supply me, and in addition to finding a few missing avocado8 files on there, I also rediscovered Super Tetris&#8212;also known as Super Sucker of Time. I LOVE that game, and I can spend HOURS playing it. Or at least I could before I became a web/software geek and began spending 8-12 hours a day actively working on a computer. Thirty minutes of playing tonight had my right wrist and elbow in knots, sadly. I wonder if I can learn to play left-handed?

<h3 class="title">I'm Trying to Rise Above This, But I Can't</h3>

<p>
I'm trying hard not to wish that <a href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/billnapoli/" target="a8_win">Bill Napoli</a> could be "brutalized and raped, sodomized as bad as you can possibly make it." I'm trying hard to find only love and compassion for this man who obviously has no love or compassion for any woman who is not "a virgin[,]... religious[,]....[and] plann[ing] on saving her virginity until she was married." I'm trying hard to pray for this man&#8212;who I deeply, firmly believe has, like any other man, no right to make any judgement whatsoever about the righteousness or worthiness of a woman who needs or wants an abortion&#8212;that he find the the enlightenment to KEEP HIS FUCKING TRAP SHUT on subjects that, unless my vengeful side wins out and somehow influences the universe to get medieval on <a href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/billnapoli/" target="a8_win">Bill Napoli</a>'s ass (and somehow impregnate him in the process), he will never know anything about.

<h3 class="title">Faaaaaaaaaaaaart!</h3>

<p>
One of the bummers about working full-time is that I don't get to witness all of Austen's new behaviors firsthand. Luckily Hannah gives me regular reports (and sometimes Austen even re-enacts the behavior as she's describing it), so I don't feel totally out of the loop, but it does still mean that I write less about new developments.
</p>

<p>
In an effort to keep up, I'm going to record the one that Hannah just told me about now: Apparently Austen was drinking out of a regular glass down in the basement, and Hannah said he had this "hey, look at me! I'm a big boy!" expression as he was doing it. And then, of course, he dumped the whole glass of water down his shirt. "Faaaaaaaaart! I thought I had it!", he scowled. Truly, his expressions are, well, just that <em>expressive</em>. The other day when his cousin was crying loudly and lengthily over something or other that didn't go his way at lunch (in a restaurant), Austen just sat there staring at him. I swear to you his expression said "what's up with you?", and, as the crying went on and on, it morphed into "come on, you're <em>embarrassing us.</em>"

<h3 class="title">Flicker</h3>

<p>
Al usually preceeds me home from work (that's what we call it, even though I work from home; if I don't come down within about 10 minutes of Hannah leaving, Al will shout up the stairs, "honey, when are you coming home?"), so it's Al who gets the scoop from Hannah about what she and Austen did that day.
</p>

<p>
Tonight I happened to call it quits about 10 minutes early, after Al had gotten home but before Hannah had left, and as I came down the stairs, Al said to me, "honey, watch this!" Hannah turned to Austen and said, "where's your nose?" Austen very carefully slid his finger up from his chin to his nose, and when he reached his nostril, he slid his finger about a millimeter inside and gave it a triumphant little flick, ending with his finger pointing out. And then turned to me and grinned.

<h3 class="title">If Only The Streets Department Cared Enough About Noise Pollution to Budget for a Few of These</h3>

I've been listening to this ridiculous alarm day after day and night after night for over two years now, and testy notes left under his windshield wipers have done nothing more than set the alarm off an additional time (when I said the alarm was sensitive, I wasn't kidding). I've seriously considered throwing a rock through his window or slashing his tires, which would be more gratifying (and probably more productive) than calling the police or the Streets Department, but I'm too law-abiding to do actual property damage. Oh, that I weren't.

<h3 class="title">We're in San Francisco!</h3>

<p>
Austen, Hannah, and I are all in San Francisco this week. I'm here working, and Hannah and Austen are busy climbing hills, chasing pigeons, admiring the views, and taking public transit all over the place.
</p>

<p>
It's been a nutty week so far; I kinda wish I'd skipped that hockey game on Monday night and come out last weekend. (It wasn't a particularly joyful hockey game, and I didn't get enough ice time to work up a sweat, anyway.) I would have had time to see more non-work friends, and I also think I would have gotten more work done. I didn't count on running into 5 or 6 people a day  who hadn't seen me in forever and with whom I'd want to spend a few minutes catching up&#8212;it really eats into spec-writing time!
</p>

<p>
Also, traveling with the Beaner means I'm a little less flexible about where I can go and when I can get there... though I probably wouldn't have as many people lined up to see me if I hadn't brought him. I'm not fool enough to think that *I'm* the draw. :)
</p>

<p>
I haven't had a chance to take many photos with the 10-D, but I'll post what I've got when I get home (I didn't bother bringing cables, since I only have my work machine with me). I *have* had a chance to take a few snaps with my new Razr, though, and I'm posting those to Flickr as I take them.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I ended up getting the new Razr as soon as the Verizon Wireless store opened on Wednesday morning because Austen broke my old Samsung phone on Tuesday night. The bottom half of the Samsung still works, but the top half&#8212;the part with the display and the earpiece&#8212;does not. This means that, on the plus side, I have a lightweight, awesome new cameraphone; on the minus side, I've lost all the phonebook entries I had. If you suspect you were among my contacts, please e-mail me your info again. Thanks.

<h3 class="title">Sick AGAIN</h3>

<p>
We arrived safely home&#8212;but sick&#8212;from San Francisco on Sunday night. Austen caught a cold on his second day in SF, and he passed it on to me on Friday night. For some reason the version I got was more virlulent, and... well, you probably don't want to know the color or quantity of the goo I'm now hacking up with every coughing fit. Never have I been more glad that I work at home, where I can drag my laptop into the bedroom if necessary. (And if this shaking doesn't stop, it may soon be necessary.)
</p>

<p>
As I alluded to in my previous post, I totally underestimated how much work it would be to bring Austen with me to SF, even though Hannah was there too. How do regular work-outside-the-home parents do it? The childcare handoffs and mad dashes to and from the office are ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
I was glad to have Austen with me, and it wasn't *too* hard to bathe him and put him to bed each night (even though he cried through every bath, and on Friday night he went completely ballistic at bedtime, to the point where *I* was sobbing and begging him to JUST STOP CRYING). I'm also really glad he and Hannah got a chance to explore San Francisco, and that Austen and Ellen (Jean and Sho's daughter) got not one but TWO opportunities to play together. But for all that, I'm not sure I'd do it again. I guess it depends on the length of the trip, and whether Al is coming with us or not, but at the moment I'm thinking no.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, we'd already decided before this trip that I'd be going to the Vancouver Tournament alone this year; now that Austen's walking, it's too hard to watch him at hockey games, and it'd be no fun for Al to chase Austen around all the time while I played. Plus, it's just damn expensive (not to mention difficult) to get from Philadelphia to Vancouver with a toddler. We decided we'd rather use the money to send Al on a weekend by himself, doing something he wants to do.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, at the moment work and sleep are my highest priorities, but I'll upload the few photos I took in SF (mostly of Austen rather than of the city itself) to Flickr as soon as I feel better.

<h3 class="title">Spring Has Sprung!</h3>

<p>
Austen and I went out for a walk this morning before work, and we totally dawdled on the way back because it's SUCH A GLORIOUS DAY. Spring has sprung in Philadelphia, yay!!
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/120310527/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/46/120310527_7cb1be71c3_m.jpg" width="192" height="240" alt="spring has sprung" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I've opened the window next to my desk, and through it are wafting a wonderfully brisk spring breeze, the smell of pizza and hoagies being prepared at Pete's, and the sounds of buses and cars and workmen and walkers. I won't be dismissing any prompts to Run around the block! today.
