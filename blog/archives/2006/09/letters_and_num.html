<p>
Today's adventures in audio include the Beaner singing the alphabet song with me and following my lead as I count to ten, and the Beaner and I pretending to talk to each other on the phone. That's how I ended up getting a pretty good recording of his speech: I started out by trying to record him chatting on the hotel phone (he picked it up and started gabbling away while we were in the sitting area of the hotel suite), but when he saw me approach with my cell phone held out, he hung up the hotel phone and reached for the cell. He motioned for me to pick up the hotel phone, and we pretended to have a conversation&#8212;while the cell phone was still recording. He was talking directly into the mouthpiece, which is more than I could have hoped for. The alphabet is the second conversation. (The photos were taken at home, last night.)
