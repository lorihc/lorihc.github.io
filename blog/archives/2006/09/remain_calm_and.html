<h3 class="title">Remain Calm... And Do Not Leave the Building</h3>

<p>
There's a fire alarm going off in my husband's building. An announcement over the PA has indicated that the alarm is on the 35th floor, and that the Fire Department has arrived to investigate... but in the meantime, employees are not to use the elevators or the fire stairs. In other words, remain at your desks. Do not leave the building. Everything's fine.
</p>


<p>
Sound familiar?
</p>

<p>
Yeah, to me, too. The last time I knew of where employees were told to ignore the fire alarms and remain at their desks was five years ago today. The people who obeyed that directive are all dead now, buried in the rubble of the Twin Towers.
</p>

<p>
This alarm is probably nothing; I heard no roar of jet engines over the city minutes ago, and my husband says this sort of false alarm happens at his building a few times a year. Still, because of the date, because of this most frightening of anniversaries, I am nervous.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Update, 11:48am ~ </strong>Everything's fine; it <em>was</em> a false alarm, and they're resetting the building's alarm system. I still have a tightness in my chest, though...

<p>Shmoo's daycare had a fire drill yesterday . . . right in the middle of nap time. I think whoever decided on that timing should have had to babysit Mr. Overtired Crankypants and all his daycare buddies yesterday evening.</p>

<p>But all in all, of course I'm relieved that it was just a drill.</p>

<p>I'm glad it was just a false alarm for your husband, too.</p>
