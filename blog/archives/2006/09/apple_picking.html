<h3 class="title">Apple Picking!</h3>

<p>
We've been shouting "APPLE PICKING!" at each other for about a week and a half now. At first it was in anticipation of the event&#8212;the first of two we hope to complete this season&#8212;which was scheduled for this past Saturday in Stow, MA. Ever since we got back, it's been to remind ourselves what a great time we had, and how many wonderful apples are taking up all the space in our fridge. (By the way, The Beaner learned "apple picking" right away, and he repeats it as often as we do.)
</p>
<p>
We met my friend Suzanne (from junior high!) and her family at <a href="http://www.honeypothill.com/">Honey-Pot Hill</a>, where we were amazed to find that the rain had not deterred at least 50 other families from picking apples or going on hayrides. I think if I'd not been away from Massachusetts for so long, or if we hadn't been the only ones picking in a downpour in Pennsylvania last year, I wouldn't have been so surprised. Apple picking is just one of the things you do in the fall in New England; it's as normal and expected as raking leaves or trick or treating.
</p>

<p>
Suzanne and I hadn't seen each other in over 20 years (though we have corresponded on paper and via e-mail occasionally in that time), so it was really fun to get together. She looked so fabulous, and she was was just as warm and real and fun to be around as I remembered. The Beaner and Suzanne and Tom's son G had an absolute ball chasing each other around the trees while munching apples and feeding the goats near the farm store. I would have taken more photos, but I was busy chatting up a storm (and probably boring Suzanne and Tom to death) and occasionally filling our 20lb. bag with Empires, Macintoshes, Cortlands, and Liberties. We'll probably be eating apples and making applesauce right up 'til Fuji season in late October, when we hope to make another trip to Weaver's with our friends the Otts. Yay, apple picking!

<p>We took Lucy apple picking over the weekend as well.  She had a ball - she ran from tree to tree chanting "apple, apple, apple", occasionally stopping at a smashed one on the ground and saying "Ewwwwww!"  I'm pretty sure she would have picked every apple in the orchard if we let her.  </p>

<p>Looks like you guys had fun too!</p>

<p>Is Weaver's a good place? I think we'll need to go a second time this fall, too. The only other place I've been to around here is Linvilla Orchards, which is great but VERY crowded on October weekends.</p>

<p>We've only been to Weaver's once (and it was in a downpour), so I can't compare it to other orchards in the area. Our nanny recommended it after going there herself with a friend. When we went (probably because of the downpour), we were the only ones picking. I didn't go into the store, but Al did and said it was cute. We got hot cider and a FABULOUS crook-neck pumpkin that I made pumpkin risotto and pumpkin muffins and other baked goodies with for weeks afterward (and the seeds spouted in our compost pot!). They also had a little chicken barbecue set up on our way out, and Al got lunch. All in all, a nice experience despite the rain.</p>

<p>How does Linvilla charge for PYO? At Honey-Pot Hill it was by the bag ($18 for a 20lb. bag, and I think $12 or $15 for a 1/2 peck and a 1/4 peck kids bag). At Weaver's they gave us two round plastic baskets (like laundry baskets) lined with plastic bags, and then we paid by the pound for what we picked. I can't remember the exact price, but I think it was a bit less than Honey-Pot Hill.</p>

<p>Funny--the picture of G in the tree reminded me of photos I took of O and his second cousin R picking cherries in Denmark this summer . . . </p>
