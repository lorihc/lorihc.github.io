<h3 class="title">My Turn</h3>

<p>
I know I haven't blogged since a week ago Friday; consequently, I have a bunch of stuff I want to talk about clogging up my brain... and keeping me from blogging. (Funny how that works.) Since I'm writing from the car on Al's Blackberry, I'll probably limit my remarks to what happened most recently&#8212;which also happens to be the cure for blogclog writer's block (i.e., start from where you are, not from the beginning).

<p>
We are traveling to State College, PA this weekend, and last night we stayed at a Homewood Suites in Mechanicsburg. The room smelled like there was a dead body stashed under the couch (I am NOT exaggerating!), but otherwise, it was OK. The Beaner spent all but 5 minutes of our time in Mechanicsburg (ok, <em>now</em> I'm exaggerating) whining "my turn! my turn! my turn!" and occasionally bursting into tears. We couldn't figure out why he was trying to pull the suitcases off the luggage cart as he yelled "my turn!"... until we passed an empty luggage cart in the hallway, and he climbed up on it and yelled "MY TURN!" triumphantly. Yep, he wanted a ride.
