<h3 class="title">List of Demands</h3>

<p> This morning when I heard The Beaner howl, I poked Al, as I normally do, and mumbled, &quot;he's up.&quot; Al responded with dreadful news: &quot;It's 1:30.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, normally if The Beaner wakes screaming in the middle of the night, we let him cry it out. Occasionally, if it sounds like he's screaming BLOODY MURDER and the entire earth might split in two, one of us (Al) will go up and see if he's OK, and maybe even bring him down to sleep with us. The middle-of-the night screaming bouts are rare, however, and the ones that end up with him sleeping with us even rarer. I fully expected The Beaner to go back to sleep on his own.</p>
<p>That's when the screams turned into a list of demands, delivered <em>while crying</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Mommy!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Daddy!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Mommy, up!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Mommy, up!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Daddy!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Daddy, gooooo dooooowwwwwn staaaaairs!&quot;<br />
  &quot;Gooooo dooooowwwwwn staaaaairs!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wal-KING!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wal-KING!&quot;<br />
&quot;WAAAAL-KING!&quot;</p>
<p>For pete's sake, kid, <em>be reasonable</em>. And also? Start smaller. You could have stuck with just &quot;Mommy!&quot; and &quot;Daddy!&quot; for your first time yelling actual words from behind the closed door of your upstairs bedroom, and you would have broken our hearts. The demand to go for a walk was just over the top.

<p>Nope, he definitely meant that he wanted to go for a walk... although it's debatable whether what he calls a walk is actually a walk. What he means when he says "wal-KING" is "please carry me down the street while I point out every car I know to you." Lately he's not just been pointing out cars, but noting their absence as well. "Looking more Bobs," he'll say, meaning that one Saab was just not enough, and we must keep walking until he finds at least two more. He'll also point out where a Jeep is or VW is *usually* parked, but isn't right now. "Jeep gone. Anonna VW... gone." And last night, in the dim fall evening light, he shouted "Meckuwee UP!" when a neighbor raised the hatch on his SUV. I turned and squinted and said, "I think that's a Ford [or Fhut, which recently evolved from Do]." The neighbor replied, "No, it's a Mercury." (It was a Mountaineer.) At least we know Austen's eyesight is good -- he can also spot Saabs and Hyundais and even Volvo trucks at a hundred yards off.</p>

<p>I think he's testing the limits. Trying to find the balance. Inside his little baby brain he's thinking "alright, I'm damn cute. My cute is gonna buy me a lot, at least for the next 11 years until I become a gawky teenager. As such, I wanna see just how much this cute entitles me to."  Trust me here. I too was a cute baby.</p>
