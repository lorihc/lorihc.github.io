<h3 class="title">It's Reunion Time</h3>

<p>
I graduated high school in 1986&#8212;in other words, 20 years ago. I'm still not sure if I'm interested in going to my high school reunion, but it's been fun learning about where my former classmates from Sanderson High School in Raleigh, North Carolina are now via a Yahoo! group set up for that purpose. I wish there were a similar group for Needham High School Class of 1986; while I didn't graduate from NHS, the kids I knew there were the ones I grew up with, and therefore they're the ones I'm most curious about now.
</p>
<p>
I should make it clear that I know of no reunion plans for NHS '86, aside from the fact that NHS reunions in general usually take place on the Friday after Thanksgiving. I'm just posting this so that anyone else who happens to Google "Needham High School Class of 1986" or "Needham High Class of 1986" will get something other than registration-only reunion sites and irrelevant references to other high schools in the results. Maybe I'll even find a long-lost classmate or two.

<p>Hi! Yes, I finally do know of reunion plans for both Needham High School Class of 1986 and Sanderson High School Class of 1986. </p>

<p>NHS will be having its reunion on Friday, November 24 in Newton, MA and SHS will be having a whole bunch of reunion activities starting with the homecoming game on October 13 (actual cocktail party is October 14) in Raleigh, NC. </p>

<p>Post a comment here and be sure to include your e-mail address and which reunion you're interested in, and I'll hook you up. (Andre, I've already forwarded your info to the reunion committe for NHS.)</p>
