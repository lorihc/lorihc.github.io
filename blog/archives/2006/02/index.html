<h3 class="title">Chocolate Pretzel Trauma</h3>

<p>
Austen just had a total meltdown, both literally and figuratively, over a chocolate pretzel. Hannah got us some at Maron Chocolates, and I'd just pulled one out of the bag when Austen grabbed it and ran off. I chased him, because that pretzel was NOT A TOY, and I didn't want it to melt all over the place. 
</p>

<p>
I managed to wrest it away from him... and he promptly went ballistic. Cried, turned blue, the whole works. I tried to give him a taste of the pretzel to appease him, but what he really seemed to want was to HOLD it. I finally shoved a little piece in his mouth, ate the rest, and then just held him until he stopped crying.
</p>

<h3 class="title">It's Reunion Time</h3>

<p>
I graduated high school in 1986&#8212;in other words, 20 years ago. I'm still not sure if I'm interested in going to my high school reunion, but it's been fun learning about where my former classmates from Sanderson High School in Raleigh, North Carolina are now via a Yahoo! group set up for that purpose. I wish there were a similar group for Needham High School Class of 1986; while I didn't graduate from NHS, the kids I knew there were the ones I grew up with, and therefore they're the ones I'm most curious about now.
</p>

<p>
I should make it clear that I know of no reunion plans for NHS '86, aside from the fact that NHS reunions in general usually take place on the Friday after Thanksgiving. I'm just posting this so that anyone else who happens to Google "Needham High School Class of 1986" or "Needham High Class of 1986" will get something other than registration-only reunion sites and irrelevant references to other high schools in the results. Maybe I'll even find a long-lost classmate or two.

<p>
OK, so here's where I admit that I occasionally do wish that I were one of the Cool Kids. Most of the time I'm like, "yeah, I <em>know</em> the cool kids, but I don't hang out with them. Because, you know, I've got my own stuff to do," but lately <a href="http://www.blurbomat.com/archives/2006/02/01/signal_vs_noise" target="a8_win">several</a> <a href="http://mightygirl.net/2006_01_01_archive.html#113866393668860084" target="a8_win">of</a> <a href="http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/02_01_2006.html" target="a8_win">my</a> <a href="http://www.powazek.com/2006/01/000562.html" target="a8_win">favorite</a> <a href="http://www.hchamp.com/other/archives/000520.html" target="a8_win">blogs</a> have all been doing the Four Things Meme, and I confess I was feeling a little left out. Although no one's <em>technically</em> tagged me, and I can't pretend that I <em>never do memes (because why would you do that?)</em>, I'm going to pretend that <a href="http://johnolilly.typepad.com/blog/2006/01/four_things.html" target="a8_win">John</a> tagged me because I'm listed among the four blogs he's following.

<h3 class="title">The Accidental Litterbug</h3>

<p>
When I left the house for my usual weekend-morning walk with the Beaner, he was wearing a bib. Sadly, not the Korean bunny bib with the two snaps that he can't get off, but a disposable Pampers bib on which it's frustratingly easy for a toddler to pop the velcro. It wasn't until he started begging for the cream-cheese brownie I'd bought at the Metropolitan Bakery just south of Rittenhouse Square that I noticed that the bib was missing. Well, FART. Not only would he be getting mixed berry fruit bar crumbs all over him (I'd planned ahead and stashed one in the bottom of the stroller so I wouldn't have to share my chocolate treats), but I'd also managed to contribute to the piles of trash that deface Philadelphia.
</p>

<p>
At least I could blame that first bit of littering on the Beaner. The second bit (at least, I <em>think</em> it was the second bit; it's entirely possible that I left an entire trail of old wrappers and receipts in my wake) I can only blame on the 21st Street windtunnel and my poor positioning of the Starbucks coffee cup that said Beaner had been playing with before he conked out. As soon as we stepped into the jetstream at the corner of 21st and Market, the cup flew out of the bottom of the stroller and down the sidewalk. I chased after it for a bit, but when it went out into Market Street I decided to abandon the pursuit and return to my sleeping baby. FART! Again I say, FART! I've got to come up with a better way to secure my trash (as well as my non-trash parephenalia, like my only copy of our auto insurance cards&#8212;the ones with our address and insurance numbers right on them&#8212;that <em>becomes</em> trash when it blows out of the stroller).
</p>

<p>
In happier news, I learned from Hannah that the Beaner met <a href="http://ratphooey.livejournal.com/tag/baby" target="a8_win">The Baby</a>, who was out and about with his Auntie, in Rittenhouse Square on Friday. Apparently much hilarity (not to mention memory-searching) occurred when Hannah recognized The Baby, and the SIL/Auntie recognized the Beaner, but Hannah and the SIL didn't recognize each other. It was finally determined, just before <a href="http://ratphooey.livejournal.com/" target="a8_win">ratphooey</a> and Mom Phooey showed up, that the SIL recognized Austen because Austen attended The Baby's birthday party (which was held at her house), and Hannah recognized The Baby because The Baby was at Austen's birthday party (and because two cute photos of his 7 month-old self show up now and then on our Mac screensaver). The SIL and Hannah, only having had attended one party each, had not met each other.
</p>

<p>
In any case, much fun was had by all, especially since there was a violinist performing in the Square at the time, and both babies love music.

<h3 class="title">Player Portraits</h3>

<p>
OK, I'm a Steelers fan by proxy (I inherited my fandom from Al, though I've been a backer of Hines Ward since his Georgia days), and I'm absolutely thrilled that they won the Super Bowl. Yay, gadget plays! Yay, Hines Ward! Yay, Ben Roethlisberger! Yay, Jerome Bettis! Yay, Coach Cowher! But what I really want to know is:

<p>
Who took those fantastic portraits of the players????

<h3 class="title">Back in the Saddle</h3>

<p>
Hello everyone! Sorry for the lack of blogging over here&#8212;Al, Austen and I have been in Hawaii for the past 10 days (as you might have noticed from some of the photos popping up in the Flickr badge on the front page). I jotted down some notes during the trip and will post a vacation summary shortly. I'll also be uploading a slew of photos to Flickr sometime today or tomorrow. Stand by!

<h3 class="title">Vacation Summary, Part 1</h3>

<p>
So I didn't mention that we were going on vacation before we left for a couple reasons, but now that we're back it's probably safe to say that we were in Hawaii with both my parents and Al's. Al's parents go every year for a couple months (they're retired), but my parents had never been. Whenever we mentioned it, my mom would say that Hawaii was a place they'd go "someday."
</p>

<p>
We pretty much had to demand that they come, and even once they agreed, my mom was a bit nervous about what they would do, what they should wear, how much it would cost, etc. About halfway through our stay, however, I caught both of my parents saying, "next time, we'll...", so I think there's a good chance they'll go back with us in a couple years. I hope they do, because having both sets of grandparents there for what was also Austen's first visit was so cool. We all got time with the beaner, time to play golf, time to ourselves, and time all together. It was awesome.
</p>
<p class="pictureP">

</p>

<p>
A few of the highlights (er, yeah, highlights):
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tuesday</strong><br />
We arrive in Kahului after a 9-hour flight from Chicago, during which Austen didn't cry at all. Yay, grandparents! While waiting in the Lowe's parking lot for Al to buy a HEPA filter, Mom starts playing a game with Austen that involves a Kleenex and ridiculous questions&#8212;to which the answer is always "nOOOoooo."
</p>
<p class="pictureP">

</p>
<p>
<strong>Wednesday</strong><br />
I catch Austen practicing "nOOOoooo" and angry face (aka Hulk pose) in the mirrored closet doors in our bedroom.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thursday</strong><br />
Al and I play our first round of golf, on the Village Course. I'm +30 through the first 9 holes; by the time we finish, we've lost 6 balls each. The Village is the easiest of Kapalua's three courses. 
</p>
<p class="pictureP">

</p>
<p>
<strong>Friday</strong><br />
Austen signs &quot;please&quot; for the first time. It looks like he's making  a slashing motion across his throat, or adjusting a collar that's too tight. Mom, Dad, and I take a golf lesson with Jerry King. I already love Jerry for what he's done for my game; by the end of the lesson, Mom and Dad love him too.
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/97989188/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/39/97989188_ce927ec13d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="dad gets a golf lesson" /></a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Saturday</strong><br />
Austen says &quot;grandpa&quot; clearly for the first time while Al is changing his diaper at 6:15am. We play the Plantation Course at 6:50am with our dads; despite two errant shots (one into the road) on the first tee and the difficulty of the course (which I was playing for the first time), I improve by 8 shots over my Thursday Village score.
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/101981412/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/25/101981412_e52f96e31e_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="admiring the view" /></a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sunday</strong><br />
While our parents are out playing golf together, Al and I decide to take a drive so the beaner can have a nap. Al suggests taking the North road to a little artist colony to get banana bread for his brother; he denies that driving any part of the North road will violate our rental car contract. I swear I saw some red zones on the rental map of this area, but Al says no.
</p>
<p>
After several sharp turns (preceeded by signs instructing us to BLOW HORN) and major twists that have left me a bit nauseous despite the fact that I'm the driver, not the passenger, I ask Al if this banana bread recipe really differs all that much from my own. He replies that it's advertised as the best in the world, and that Carl has requested that we FedEx a loaf to New York.
</p>
<p>
After 20 minutes of twisting and turning, we round a bend and find ourselves on the downhill slope of a giant, one-car-wide U. There's a sheer rock wall on one side, and  a sheer dropoff on the other. There is no guardrail, but there *is* part of a palm tree blocking 1/3 of the roadway about 20 yards further on. 
</p>
<p>
Long story short: I make it to the bottom of the hill OK, but I burst into hysterical tears when a pickup truck with big tires and a lift kit meets us head on about 100 yards from the top of the U. I start screaming, &quot;I CAN'T DO IT! I CAN'T DO IT! HOW DIFFERENT CAN THAT BANANA BREAD RECIPE BE FROM MINE ANYWAY???&quot; and take my hands off the wheel. The driver of the pickup (whose right front tire is halfway over the edge of the road) waves me on, and Al encourages me to inch past her. I do, despite continuing to insist that I can't, and I manage to get to the pull-off at the top. I sit in the driver's seat screaming and crying for a full five minutes before Al talks me into moving to the passenger side for the return trip. We make it back OK and with only minimal hysteria, but there will be no banana bread for Carl (and no nap for Austen&#8212;I woke him up only 25 minutes after he fell asleep with all my screaming).
</p>

<h3 class="title">Abbreviated Chat Transcript</h3>

<p>
So late last night, as is often the case when I work too late, I had a total brain fart and couldn't remember how to do something really simple that I've done a zillion times before. In this case the really simple thing was how to connect to a server on my company's network via OSX. [It may or may not be important to my story to know that until my  company sent me a lovely new PowerBook and an even lovelier monitor, I had been using a Mac Mini hooked up to the HDTV in our living room for anything OSX-related, and that I never had occasion to browse to a file server that wasn't also a webserver on this Mini. It also may or may not be important to know that the HDTV is enormous&#8212;yay!&#8212;but the overscan was set for TV viewing, not computer viewing, so the menus, the Dock, and the left and right sides of the Desktop were always cut off&#8212;boo!] 
</p>

<p>
As is  usual when I have a brain fart while working late, in the morning an obvious solution occurred to me: Go look on the Apple website to see if there are instructions for connecting to a server. Indeed <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=19652" target="a8_win">there are</a>, and the PowerBook is now  happily downloading the 160MB of crap that I needed from the server. Unable to keep my researching prowess to myself, I IMed Al to share my glee. 
</p>
<div class="chatTranscript">
<p>
<strong>me: </strong>figured out how to connect to server on a mac
</p>
<p>
<strong> husband: </strong>to [company server name]?
</p>
<p>
<strong>me:	</strong>not obvious, especially for someone like me who doesn't use the menus much (because I could never see them before!)
</p>
<p>
<strong>husband:	</strong><img src="/blog/images/LOL.gif" alt="LOL" width="20" height="20" class="noborder" />

</p>
<p>
<strong>husband:	</strong>ah
</p>
<p>
<strong>me:	</strong>and then you type in smb://servername/sharename/
</p>
<p>
<strong>me:	</strong>I'd forgotten about smb
</p>
<p>
<strong>husband:	</strong>ah
</p>
<p>
<strong>me:	</strong>so, phew
</p>
<p>
<strong>me:	</strong>found instructions by searching around on Apple's website
</p>
<p>
<strong>me:	</strong>one document mentioned SMB, and then I knew to search for that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>husband:	</strong>funny i moused over smb to see what it means
</p>
<p>
<strong>husband:	</strong>you know how trillian has hotspots
</p>
<p>
<strong>me:	</strong>you can do that?
</p>
<p>
<strong>husband:	</strong>y
