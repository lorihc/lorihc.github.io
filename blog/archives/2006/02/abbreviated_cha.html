<h3 class="title">Abbreviated Chat Transcript</h3>

<p>
So late last night, as is often the case when I work too late, I had a total brain fart and couldn't remember how to do something really simple that I've done a zillion times before. In this case the really simple thing was how to connect to a server on my company's network via OSX. [It may or may not be important to my story to know that until my  company sent me a lovely new PowerBook and an even lovelier monitor, I had been using a Mac Mini hooked up to the HDTV in our living room for anything OSX-related, and that I never had occasion to browse to a file server that wasn't also a webserver on this Mini. It also may or may not be important to know that the HDTV is enormous&#8212;yay!&#8212;but the overscan was set for TV viewing, not computer viewing, so the menus, the Dock, and the left and right sides of the Desktop were always cut off&#8212;boo!] 
</p>
<p>
As is  usual when I have a brain fart while working late, in the morning an obvious solution occurred to me: Go look on the Apple website to see if there are instructions for connecting to a server. Indeed <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=19652" target="a8_win">there are</a>, and the PowerBook is now  happily downloading the 160MB of crap that I needed from the server. Unable to keep my researching prowess to myself, I IMed Al to share my glee.

<p>Hi Lori,</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting my blog. B of A SUCKS. Ughhh. Sorry to hear you've had some not so great experiences with them too.</p>

<p>That Thursday I went to a branch, waited 20 minutes to see a personal banker and told her about my horrible experiences on Tuesday and Wednesday. And you know what she said? "Oh, if you would have come in to see us sooner, we could have helped you then!" So the on-line people were saying, "There's nothing we can do. Wait until Thursday" but she was saying, "You should have come in Wednesday." Ahhhh!</p>

<p>Apparently there was an overdraft fee that she reversed. And by Friday morning, my account was where it was supposed to be -- not overdrawn with enough money to pay some bills.</p>

<p>She was very nice and gave me her card in case I need her again. But she apologized quite a bit for the horrible phone service. She said B/A is making some changes to the on-line part of the banking so no one really knows what's going on over there.</p>

<p>I hope you find a great bank. I'm on the look out too. :-) </p>

<p>I'm guessing the blonde with glasses is you? (That pic on your site?) I LOVE your haircut, color and glasses. Very cool! Love your look. Very hip. Am envious! My look is hopelessly midwestern and suburban. Eeek!</p>
