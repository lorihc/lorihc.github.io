<h3 class="title">The Accidental Litterbug</h3>

<p>
When I left the house for my usual weekend-morning walk with the Beaner, he was wearing a bib. Sadly, not the Korean bunny bib with the two snaps that he can't get off, but a disposable Pampers bib on which it's frustratingly easy for a toddler to pop the velcro. It wasn't until he started begging for the cream-cheese brownie I'd bought at the Metropolitan Bakery just south of Rittenhouse Square that I noticed that the bib was missing. Well, FART. Not only would he be getting mixed berry fruit bar crumbs all over him (I'd planned ahead and stashed one in the bottom of the stroller so I wouldn't have to share my chocolate treats), but I'd also managed to contribute to the piles of trash that deface Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>
At least I could blame that first bit of littering on the Beaner. The second bit (at least, I <em>think</em> it was the second bit; it's entirely possible that I left an entire trail of old wrappers and receipts in my wake) I can only blame on the 21st Street windtunnel and my poor positioning of the Starbucks coffee cup that said Beaner had been playing with before he conked out. As soon as we stepped into the jetstream at the corner of 21st and Market, the cup flew out of the bottom of the stroller and down the sidewalk. I chased after it for a bit, but when it went out into Market Street I decided to abandon the pursuit and return to my sleeping baby. FART! Again I say, FART! I've got to come up with a better way to secure my trash (as well as my non-trash parephenalia, like my only copy of our auto insurance cards&#8212;the ones with our address and insurance numbers right on them&#8212;that <em>becomes</em> trash when it blows out of the stroller).
</p>

<p>
In happier news, I learned from Hannah that the Beaner met <a href="http://ratphooey.livejournal.com/tag/baby" target="a8_win">The Baby</a>, who was out and about with his Auntie, in Rittenhouse Square on Friday. Apparently much hilarity (not to mention memory-searching) occurred when Hannah recognized The Baby, and the SIL/Auntie recognized the Beaner, but Hannah and the SIL didn't recognize each other. It was finally determined, just before <a href="http://ratphooey.livejournal.com/" target="a8_win">ratphooey</a> and Mom Phooey showed up, that the SIL recognized Austen because Austen attended The Baby's birthday party (which was held at her house), and Hannah recognized The Baby because The Baby was at Austen's birthday party (and because two cute photos of his 7 month-old self show up now and then on our Mac screensaver). The SIL and Hannah, only having had attended one party each, had not met each other.
</p>

<p>
In any case, much fun was had by all, especially since there was a violinist performing in the Square at the time, and both babies love music.

<p>Austen looked so tough, what with the scrapes on his nose!  It was very "You should see the other guy."</p>

<p>It seems Austen always has some scrape or bruise, usually on his face. He got a new one on his forehead last night when he tripped while rushing over to hug me. It's shaped just like my right front tooth, which he nearly knocked out in the collision. :D</p>
