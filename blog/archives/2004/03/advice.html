<h3 class="title">Advice</h3>

<p>
I was out walking and <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town_II/">taking photos</a> yesterday, and as I passed through Washington Square, a tiny old woman asked if she could take my arm as we crossed the street. In the block and a half that we walked together, she told me about her Parkinson's (incurable), the strangers who clean her house and do her shopping (because all her friends and relatives have died), and all the doctor's visits she'd had in the past week ("if I didn't have Parkinson's, I'd have something else by now"). Her advice to me: "Don't live too long."
