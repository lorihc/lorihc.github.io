<h3 class="title">Bay Area Bullet Points</h3>

<p>
Greetings from the Apple store in Palo Alto, CA. Al is getting his hair cut, and I came over here to check e-mail, but the Apple store employees seem to have gotten wise to that ploy&#8212;they've stuffed and encrypted the Terminal program. Drat!
</p>

<p>
I wanted to record a couple of random observations that came up yesterday:
</p>

<ul>
<li>During a discussion about outsourcing and the jobless recovery, Al noted that back in the 80s, when Japan seemed to own everything, Honda opened a plant in the U.S. Lots of folks boycotted Honda, despite the fact that they were creating jobs for U.S. workers. The reason? The profits were going to Japanese companies. Nowadays there's anger that jobs are being shifted overseas to generate profits for American companies. Which would you rather have in the U.S. if you had to choose, the jobs or the profits? I'm thinking jobs, but that's me.
</li>

<li>While driving back from dinner with our friends John and Kathy, we listened to election coverage on <a href="http://www.kqed.org" target="a8_win">KQED</a>. It was a good 40-minute ride from Palo Alto, where we'd eaten, to San Francisco, where we're staying, so we got to hear lots of news and analysis about the Super Tuesday results, as well as the results of ballot measures and Senate races in California. "See?" said Al. "We don't get this in Philly. I miss good election coverage and analysis." "It's not that Philly doesn't offer it," I replied. "It's that we don't drive in Philly." I'd been touting that as one of the benefits of living in the city&#8212;that Al's commute is a 10-minute walk, and I don't have one at all. Now I'm realizing that a small commute could be a good thing...</li>
</ul>

<p>
There was one other bullet point I wanted to share, courtesy of our friend John, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was now. I wish I'd followed my instinct and jotted down a note on my placemat at dinner last night. With any luck, John will remember what it was that made me say, "I need to blog about this" and <s>comment on this post</s> send me an e-mail. :)

<h3 class="title">Voting by Issue, Part II</h3>

<p>
At a family event in Rochester, NY this weekend, my uncle expressed the opinion that coming out (no pun intended) against gay marriage was going to be Bush's downfall. While I do think that gay marriage is a tidal wave in the making, I'm not sure that any one issue can make or break an election. (I didn't get too many answers to my "What goes into your decision about which candidate to vote for in the general elections?" question via comments on  <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/000106.html">The Ability to Beat Bush</a> post, but from talking to people about it in person, I've found that most folks base their vote on at least two or three issues&#8212;if not more&#8212;rather than one.)
</p>

<p>
This theory seems to be supported by an article in today's New York Times called "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/09/politics/09GAYS.html?th">Gay and Republican, but Not Necessarily Disloyal to the President</a>" (bad title, I know; there's no "but" situation here). One quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
In interviews last week several gay Republicans said they resented the assumption that while straight people worry about taxes or national security, gays and lesbians vote according to their sexuality alone. ... "There are so many more issues involved," said Jim McFarland of Milwaukee, a member of the Pro-Life Alliance of Gays and Lesbians and one of the gay Republicans who met with Mr. Bush in Austin. "I think he would handle foreign policy much better, he would handle fiscal policy much better. I certainly don't want that big tax cut reversed that he passed. There are other issues that have a big impact on my life."
</blockquote>

<p>
Speaking of that big tax cut, I had assumed some of my older, business- and investment-minded relatives would be firmly behind Bush because of it. Instead, several thought it was just plain dumb. In addition, they thought going into Iraq unilaterally was (in addition to being dumb) downright dangerous. None of them gives a rat's ass about gay marriage (perhaps because they already welcome the long-term partners of gay cousins, nieces, or nephews at family gatherings). They do, however, care about deficits, and about burdening the younger members of the family with a huge national debt. My great aunt, to whom the Republican National Committee keeps sending photos of the President as thanks for her support, will likely be voting Democratic this time around.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Bookweek</h3>

<p>
This has been a week of books for me. I hadn't read much since my Austen binge back in the fall; after zipping through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743259823/ref=nosim/avocado8" target="a8_win">Party Monster</a>, I was stymied by a rather boring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684807610/ref%3Dnosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">biography of Ben Franklin</a>. What snapped me out of the reading lull was our vacation in February, which prompted me to grab a bought-years-ago-but-never-read title off the shelf in our guest room: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316491977/ref%3Dnosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Soul of a New Machine</a>, by Tracy Kidder. I then decided to tackle <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385504209/ref%3Dnosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">The Da Vinci Code</a>, which I'd wanted to read for over a year; my mom got to it first, and she lent me her copy. I read it in about two days, and I found myself wanting to write a <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/books/bookdetail.php?bookID=2">capsule review</a> immediately after finishing it.
</p>

<p>
This led me to finally convert my previously-static <a  href="/reviews/books">book reviews</a> into a mySql database and add some new reviews... which in turn has made me want to read more.
</p>

<p>
Lucky for me, Al and I decided to spend most of the day today weeding through our combined book collections. We pulled out old paystubs, airline tickets, grocery lists, and drugstore receipts that originally served as bookmarks but that now serve as lifemarks and separated the volumes into Keep, Sell, and Toss piles. I also started a fourth, unlabeled pile, which I referred to as "Books I Want to Read (or Finally Get Rid Of) Soon". I have a habit of buying books off the New Releases or bargain tables three or four at a time, and then only reading one of them. I forget that I have a backlog of interesting books&#8212;or I switch from non-fiction to fiction or vice versa&#8212;and I go out and buy three or four more. Al must do something similar, because he had quite a few books that he'd never read, either.
</p>

<p>
So the reason the sorting turned out to be lucky for me is that I'm trying to be more frugal&#8212;and with a stack of books I can read now, and another stack I can trade at a used bookstore for other titles later, I may not have to buy a new book for a good long while.
</p>

<p>
Among the books I bought for myself months or years ago and forgot about:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316853186/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Camberwell Beauty</a>, by Jenny Eclaire (purchased, I think, on my last trip to London in 2001)<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553575104/avocado8/" target="a8_win">In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner</a>, by Elizabeth George<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316353299/avocado8/" target="a8_win">an underachiever's diary</a>, by benjamin anastas<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140262032/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Revenge of the Cootie Girls</a>, by Sparkle Hayter<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0688169724/avocado8/" target="a8_win">The Last Manly Man</a>, by Sparkle Hayter<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060987529/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister</a>, by Gregory Maguire<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684849690/avocado8/" target="a8_win">The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn</a>, by Robin Maxwell  (ordered from Amazon four years ago)<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425171205/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Jack, Knave and Fool</a>, by Bruce Alexander (picked up at a Girls' Brunch book swap a couple years ago)<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609806858/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Strawberry Tatoo</a>, by Lauren Henderson (ditto)<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743418174//avocado8/" target="a8_win">Good in Bed</a>, by Jennifer Weiner<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316353299/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Blue Highways</a>, by William Least Heat-Moon (purchased on Amazon in 2001 on somebody's recommendation, I can't remember whose)
</p>

<p>
From Al's collection, I added to the pile:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393323528/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Next</a>, by Michael Lewis<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471397768/avocado8/" target="a8_win">J.K. Lasser's Real Estate Investing</a>, by Michael C. Thomsett<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684868873/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Power Plays: Shakespeare's Lessons in Leadership and Management</a>, by John O. Whitney and Tina Packer<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071417931/avocado8/" target="a8_win">The New No-Nonsense Landlord</a>, by Richard H. Jorgensen<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375705244/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Founding Brothers</a>, by Joseph J. Ellis
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure where to start... but first I have to finish a book I'm not particularly enjoying, but which I want to get through so I can move it to the Sell pile (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573229911/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Secret Celebrity</a>, by Carol Wolper, whose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573228184/avocado8/" target="a8_win">The Cigarette Girl</a> I read a couple years ago and liked). Who needs a job when there are books to be read?

Her advice to me: "Don't live too long."

<h3 class="title">Opting Out</h3>

<p>
Yesterday was the deadline for registering to vote in the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania. (Yep, that's right: Pennsylvania still hasn't had its Democratic primary. That won't happen until April 27, which is about two months after John Kerry was annointed the de facto Democratic nominee.) I let the deadline pass without re-registering as a Democrat. As much as I wanted to vote my conscience, I chose to preserve my Non-Partisan status and save my vote for the November election. The question now is, how will I vote?
</p>

<p>
The answer seems obvious to me, yet when I took the Vote by Issue Quiz (which I <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/000108.html">mentioned</a> back in early February, but took in January, before Dick Gephardt dropped out of the race), I didn't match John Kerry on a single issue. He might have been my second choice on some of them, but I didn't research that as thoroughly as I'd intended to. 
</p>

<p>
I'm not crazy about Kerry, but do I want Bush? Hell, no. Against my will I am becoming one of those "anybody but Bush" people. I just wish our "anybody" was somebody else. The good news is that if Kerry wins, I can see in some of the former candidates the makings of a very interesting Cabinet...
</p>

<p>
Speaking of "opting-out," I finally got around to installing MT-Blacklist, which should make it safe to turn commenting back on until MT 3.0 comes out. Not that I get a lot of legitimate comments anyway, but I'd like the option of starting a discussion without being interrupted by penises and phentermine, Lolitas and Las Vegas real estate. Good riddance, hrie@yahoo.com!
