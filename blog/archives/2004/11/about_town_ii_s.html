<h3 class="title">About Town II Special Edition: Election Day</h3>

<p>
I'm posting the photos I took between about 11am and 12:30pm today over at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town_II/archives/cat__election_day_2004_.shtml" target="a8_win">about town II</a>. I have a few more to add (including two more of Bush supporters), but we have to leave for our childbirth class now. I'll add them when I get home tonight.
</p>

<p>
One important thing to note when you look at the photos: I <strong>didn't </strong>photograph every Kerry sign I saw, but I <strong>did </strong>photograph every Bush sign I saw. (If I <em>had</em> photographed every Kerry sign, I would have run out of room on my camera's memory card before I'd made it 10 blocks from home.) Of course, since I'm limited to a slow shuffle by the weight of the belly and my flagging energy levels, I was only out in the Logan Square, Penn Center/Libery Place, and Rittenhouse/Fitler Square areas today. When I went out walking in Society Hill a few months back, I saw more than one Bush/Cheney sign (including a huge one plastered on the side of row house).

Back in a couple hours!
