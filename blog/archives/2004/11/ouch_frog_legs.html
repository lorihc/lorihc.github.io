<h3 class="title">Ouch, Frog Legs</h3>

<p>
I don't know why it didn't occur to me that slowly lowering myself into a squat to paint along the baseboards in the bathroom on Monday&#8212;and then slowly raising myself back up, repeatedly&#8212;would be like doing squats at the gym while holding a 35 lb. medicine ball, but it didn't. Since midday yesterday I have been paying for that oversight.
</p>

<p>
If only I had known that I was straining the very muscles I'd need later to lower myself onto a couch or toilet seat, to climb stairs, and&#8212;god forbid I should need to anytime soon&#8212;push the baby out, I would have painted only the top half of the bathroom walls and installed a chair rail or something.

<p>Ouch, is right. I was kneeding a failed pizza dough, (new recipe) and the next day I felt like I had Popeye's forearms. Man they were sore.</p>

<p>You are amazing! Most of my friends here, who were in their last weeks of pregnancy, were exhausted and very unmotivated. I don't even think they were willing to vacuum, much less paint a room!</p>

<p>I am giddy with anticipation for the arrival of Baby Boy Cho!!</p>
