<h3 class="title">When You're Smiling</h3>

<p>
Remember how I said, months ago, that I couldn't get any other pregnant women to smile back at me? Well, now I'm getting smiled at all the time&#8212;by new moms. It seems like every woman I pass with a child under a year old flashes me with a knowing smile, like they can't wait to welcome me to the club. Meanwhile, I haven't noticed too many other pregnant women outside of my childbirth class; could it be that there are zillions of women in their second trimester who are busily smiling at me, and I'm not noticing them? Could they be writing in their blogs about how the very pregnant woman they passed on Market Street yesterday didn't smile back, and how it hurt their feelings?
