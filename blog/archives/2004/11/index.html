<p>
 Happy All Saints' Day, aka Day of the Dead, aka November 1st! We experienced our first Philadelphia Halloween last night, and while fairly different from our Mountain View Halloween experiences, it was a <a href="/halloween/archives/2004/index.html">great success</a>. Several friends and relatives outside of Philly have asked to see my Patrick Starfish costume, so here it is (click on the photos to see larger versions):
</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<table width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="15">
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/pink_klansman.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/pink_klansman.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/pink_klansman_half.jpg" alt="the pink klansman" width="200" height="300" galleryImg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">The original prototype, aka The Pink Klansman. The shirt is from the maternity department at Target, the hood is just a yard and a half of pink fleece pinned together, the gloves are pink wool-lined suede from Kohl's, and the lounge pants, turned inside out, are from Gap Body. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/now_with_mouth.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/now_with_mouth.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/now_with_mouth_half.jpg" alt="now, with mouth!" width="200" height="300" galleryImg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">We realized a fter taking the first photo that we'd need to put some stuffing in the pointy bit on top to keep it pointy. Since I couldn't see through the fleece, Al helped me mark where the eyeholes should go with tape. He got a bit ambitious and decided to mark where he thought the eyebrows and mouth should go as well.
I'm kind of amazed that this photo isn't blurry, because Al couldn't stop laughing as he was trying to take the picture.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/full_gig.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/full_gig.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/full_gig_half.jpg" alt="the full costume (no padding necessary in the belly area)" width="200" height="300" galleryImg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">The completed costume. Since I don't sew, everything that would otherwise have been sewn is held together with safety pins. The pink feet are toddler-sized pink tights cut in half, pulled over my clogs, and held up first with rubber bands (which cut off my circulation) and later with clear hockey tape (which stuck to my skin, but it was still better than the rubber bands). The belly is real (and I have to say, this is probably the first time I felt really skinny while pregnant&#8212;the real Patrick is much shorter and wider on the bottom than I am). </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/super_patrick.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/super_patrick.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/super_patrick_half.jpg" alt="this is before we pinned back the extra hood material" width="200" height="300" galleryimg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">The eyeholes are behind the pupils (and thus they're very small). I realized as I was painting the hood that Patrick's head wasn't as pointy as I'd thought, so I tucked the point in a bit. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/blogging.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/blogging.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/blogging_half.jpg" alt="Patrick takes blogging very seriously" width="200" height="300" galleryImg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">This is me attempting to blog about all our trick-or-treaters with the hood on. Thank god I know how to touch type. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/smiling.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/smiling.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/smiling_half.jpg" alt="smile, Patrick!" width="200" height="300" galleryimg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">Again, Al was totally cracking up as he took this photo. I couldn't decide what he thought was funnier: the costume, or the fact that I was blogging in it. </td>
</tr>

<h3 class="title">Let's Prove the Pundits Wrong</h3>

<p>
How many people think that tomorrow's election will be a blowout?
</p>

<p>
Well, maybe not a blowout, but a lot closer than all the pundits are predicting? I contend that it could happen. I believe&#8212;and this could just be wishful thinking on my part, I admit&#8212;that I will wake up on November 3 and know who the next president will be. (Although it's true that many states will be counting absentee ballots well into next week.)
</p>

<p>
I even believe&#8212;and again, this could be liberal coast wishful thinking&#8212;that not only will the win be decisive, but that the winner will be John Kerry. As <a href="http://www.zogby.com/" target="a8_win">John Zogby</a> said on the Daily Show the other night, "if the election were between Bush and Not Bush, Not Bush would win." It gets a little more complicated when there's no Not Bush option&#8212;only Kerry, Nader, and a few other random candidates&#8212;but I think reasonable people who aren't giant fans of Kerry can hold their noses and vote for him anyway as, at worst, the lesser of two evils, and at best, a force for change.
</p>

<p>
I hate that I'll be holding my nose and voting for a couple candidates in my state and local elections whom I otherwise wouldn't support&#8212;mainly because they're less scary than the alternative&#8212;but I'd rather do it than wake up and find that the alternative had won.
</p>

<p>
Please get out and vote tomorrow. <strong>Your vote really does count. </strong>And though I might question your sanity if you vote for Bush rather than Not Bush, I will applaud you for performing your civic duty and participating in the political process. I'd rather be proven wrong on my blowout prediction and find that this country really is divided right down the middle into two camps, than to find it's really divided into three: good, bad, and indifferent. For those of you already squarely in the Not Bush camp, help prove me right. Let's go for the blowout.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Vote!</h3>

<p>
My plan was to vote at around 10am this morning, after the people with day jobs had had a chance at it, but as I woke up at 6:20 this morning and couldn't get back to sleep, and the dryer repairman came at 7:55 and was done by 8:15, Al asked me if I wanted to go vote with him. I agreed, figuring that if the lines were too long, I would just come back later.
</p>

<p>
The line *was* long, but Al held my place while I went to get a coffee 4 blocks away, and by the time I returned he'd made it about halfway through. It was only about another 15 minutes or so after that. I'd intended to bring my camrea with me, but in the rush to head out with Al I forgot it. As soon as I'm done writing this, I'll head back out to take election-day photos.
</p>

<p>
Some observations on the day so far:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>What's wrong with waving? </b>I woke up to lots of honking, and I thought, "Jeez, don't you realize this is a residential neighborhood? Get over your petty commuter issues about who pulled out in front of whom and give the horn a break!" After passing a woman holding up a HONK FOR KERRY sign at the corner of 20th and the Ben Franklin Parkway on the way for coffee, however, I'm now wondering if all the honking wasn't in anger, but in support of our next president. Either way, I wish that woman had encouraged people to WAVE FOR KERRY instead of honk.</li>
<li><b>Looking for trouble </b>I overheard a guy a few people in front of us in the voting line questioning the volunteer pollworker about whether there were any sample ballots in Spanish. When she replied that she didn't know, he said, "well, there are SUPPOSED TO BE!" Pollworker: "Do you need one? Or do you know of anyone else here who needs one?" Man: "No, but THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AVAILABLE." Pollworker: "Let me ask." When she returned, she pointed out that the sample ballots were already bilingual (every party was listed in both English and Spanish, as were the instructions for voting). The man reached for the ballot she was holding and quickly scanned it. "There's nothing on here about provisional ballots. You have to tell people that they're entitled to cast a provisional ballot." Personally, I'm convinced that if someone who spoke only Spanish showed up and was denied the right to vote, someone else in the line would have told him or her about the provisional ballot option. There are just too many people itching for a fight here to have it happen otherwise.</li>
<li><b>Riiiiiiiiiight </b>Al's plan was to vote a straight Democratic ticket (he was a bit nervous that it wouldn't work correctly, so he ended up voting one candidate at a time). When he came out of the booth, he said to me, "I think that volunteer [a different one than the woman with the ballot] was a Republican." Me: "What makes you say that?" Al: "When I walked up to the booth, she said, 'If you want to vote a straight party ticket, just press here, where it says "Republican."'"</li>
<li><b>What does it take to get a ticket in this town? </b>After voting, I walked Al to work. At the corner of 17th and Market, we opted not to cross with the green because we didn't get a head start, and if it turned yellow, I wasn't going to be able to run. (I'm feeling a lot of pressure from the baby this morning.) While we waited, we noticed a cop pull up to the red light on Market, while none of the traffic with the green light was moving. Turns out it was because the first car in line, a cab, was taking on a passenger. He finally went just as the light turned yellow&#8212;and not one but THREE cars behind him ran the red light. The cop just looked after them, and drove on.</li>
<li><b>Yikes! </b>On the way home, I found myself approaching the corner of 16th and JFK just as a fire truck was pulling up to block three lanes of traffic on JFK (there was already a cop car blocking one). As I crossed JFK, I saw the reason for the blockage: there was a man lying under a bloody sheet with paramedics and firemen attending him. I don't know whether he was hit by a car or what, but it wasn't pretty.</li>
</ul>

<p>
More observations (and photos!) from Election Day later...

<h3 class="title">About Town II Special Edition: Election Day</h3>

<p>
I'm posting the photos I took between about 11am and 12:30pm today over at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town_II/archives/cat__election_day_2004_.shtml" target="a8_win">about town II</a>. I have a few more to add (including two more of Bush supporters), but we have to leave for our childbirth class now. I'll add them when I get home tonight.
</p>

<p>
One important thing to note when you look at the photos: I <strong>didn't </strong>photograph every Kerry sign I saw, but I <strong>did </strong>photograph every Bush sign I saw. (If I <em>had</em> photographed every Kerry sign, I would have run out of room on my camera's memory card before I'd made it 10 blocks from home.) Of course, since I'm limited to a slow shuffle by the weight of the belly and my flagging energy levels, I was only out in the Logan Square, Penn Center/Libery Place, and Rittenhouse/Fitler Square areas today. When I went out walking in Society Hill a few months back, I saw more than one Bush/Cheney sign (including a huge one plastered on the side of row house).
</p>

<p>
Back in a couple hours!
</p>

<p>
What I want right now is a box of See's chocolates, to sit here in bed and drown my sorrows in sugar. I probably shouldn't be blogging in this state. I'm exhausted, I'm despondent, and I'm VERY pregnant&#8212;a bad enough combination without adding to the mix the fact that I haven't had time to process what happened last night, to think less emotionally about what it means to me, to us as a (soon-to-be-expanding) family, to us as Americans. To ALL OF US as Americans. In short, I have not had time to hyperanalyze the situation, as my sister would say, using the same tone that my mom used to say "Lori, stop being so <em>precocious</em>" when I was little. So what will follow are some random, less-than-coherent thoughs that are mostly fueled by the four super-sweet, not-nearly-as-good-as-See's chocolate creams that I was able to find at the bottom of my backpack next to the bed.
</p>

<p>
In case it doesn't come through in this blog, I am the kind of person who usually tries to see the bright side of everything. I am a person who will criticize and vilify...until others start to pile on, at which point I will start to argue that perhaps we don't know the whole story, that we should give this villian the benefit of the doubt, that there's room for different viewpoints, that it does no good to hate. I am trying very hard right now to see the bright side. I am trying very hard to understand where 51% of the country is coming from, and whether we can, in fact, get along. 
</p>

<p>
I said to Al the other day that I thought that the country was so divided that&#8212;as much as I wanted to preserve the state of the union&#8212;perhaps it was time to at least entertain the idea of splitting into separate countries. Al replied, "I think we [and I think here he meant those in the reality-based community] should just all move to California." "Oh," I said. "I was thinking that we'd be the ones to stay. I had this idea that we were the ones who were upholding the Constitution as envisioned by the founding fathers, the ones who wanted to practice religion freely and yet maintain the separation of church and state, the ones who believe it's possible to have a just, moral society without imposing our personal morals on others. <em>We</em> would stay the United States of America." I can be so naive sometimes.
</p>

<p>
There are also moments when I can be practical and clear-thinking. For example, while all the pundits were saying that the massive voter turnout boded well for Kerry because "people don't stand in line to vote for more of the same," I was busy panicking&#8212;because I was thinking of all the social conservatives the Republicans had mobilized, all the people who might not be voting for Bush but rather for their way of life, all the people who hadn't bothered to vote in 2000 and then had to listen to liberals whine for four years about how the election had been stolen, all the people who were thinking, "not this time! This time we're going to make sure we protect our values and make it clear what this country is all about." I was thinking that while a high turnout in heavily Democratic Philadelphia was a GREAT sign, the liberals didn't have a monopoly on anger, and that people outside of the big, coastal cities *would* stand in line to keep the status quo&#8212;or to move the country even further to the right.
</p>

<p>
Last night, as it became obvious that things were not going our way, I started to despair. I was thinking that I wasn't sure I wanted to stay in a country that could not only support this administration and its policies by voting directly for Bush, but also support it by proxy, by voting for more Republican senators and congressmen. I was thinking about where we could go, where in the world would be safe with Bush and the Republicans leading the world's only remaining superpower, when my brother-in-law popped into my head, and I actually started to cry.
</p>

<p>
I'm pretty sure my brother-in-law, whom I love despite our political differences (he once voted for Buchanan, if that gives you an idea), has at least some respect and affection for me as his wife's sister. And yet, as I thought about voicing this thought about leaving the country at the baby shower my sister is throwing for us this weekend at her home, I could hear him saying, "good, go." It made me very, very sad. It still does.
</p>

<p>
This morning Al and I were talking about how incredulous we were that 51% of the country could support this president and his agenda. His approval ratings are below 50%! How could people still vote for him? "I don't think they were voting for Bush, or even on the issues..." Al began, but I interrupted him. "Yes they were," I said. "I think they were very much voting on the issues: abortion, gay marriage, gun control, Iraq. We can't assume that people who don't agree with us aren't thinking logically, or aren't voting on the issues. But as far as voting for Bush... I think while we&#8212;okay, maybe just I&#8212;were busy counting up the votes for Not Bush and thinking blowout, a bunch of people in this country were voting for Not Kerry. Nobody ever talked about the Not Kerry option, but it had to be there. You gotta figure the prospect of a Kerry presidency scared some people more than the prospect of another four years of Bush."
</p>

<p>
Right now I'm not thinking so much of moving to Canada or South Korea or Sweden, but I am wondering how we're going to get through the next four years as Americans if these election results hold up (or even if they don't). I am scared to death not so much of having a complete goober in the oval office for another four years as I am of what said goober, who saw a 500,000 popular-vote <em>loss</em> as a mandate for his right-wing agenda in 2000, will do with a 3 million vote margin of victory.
</p>

<p>
My only hope is&#8212;and I actually prayed about this last night&#8212;that if Bush does go all right-wing agenda on us, that it will lead to some dramatic change in this country. Whether it leads to a backlash that sweeps Democrats into office in 2008, or to the creation of a third (or even a fourth) political party that's neither union/socialist liberal nor religious conservative, or even to an actual split of the US into two countries, I hope that a second Bush term can produce something positive, however unintentionally. Heck, it might even make us coastal liberals decide to sit down with the middle-of-the-country conservatives and try to figure out what we have in common, how we can move forward together without regard to Bush at all. Wouldn't that be fun, to come together as a people, and cut the President out of the loop?
</p>

<p>
OK, I know, the naivit&eacute; is creeping in again...but so is the hope. I need some more chocolate.
</p>

<p>
I won't try to explain every selection on this list; I'll just say that when I finished the last post, I really needed to hear some music. Some that made me feel better, some that made me feel indignant, some that made me feel resigned... some that just made me <em>feel</em>. Here's the new Post-Election Blues playlist, in no particular order (since I Shuffle Songs anyway).

<h3 class="title">Is It Moral to Spend More Than You Make?</h3>

<p>
From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/04/business/04econ.html?th" target="a8_win">Deficits and Tax System Changes in Bush's Second-Term Economy</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Federal tax revenue was $100 billion lower this year than when Mr. Bush took office, but spending is $400 billion higher.</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>
Moral values don't come cheap, apparently. My question is: Is it moral to saddle your children with a mountain of debt? Is it moral to ask for a tax cut while saying you support the war in Iraq? (What exactly are you supporting it with, if not tax dollars? Good will doesn't buy body armor, my friends.) Is it moral to ask our President, our country, to fight a war on terror while refusing to make any personal sacrifices? (For the record, standing in long security lines at the airport doesn't count as a sacrifice. Giving up your civil rights probably does, but that doesn't generate any revenue.)

<h3 class="title">Things I've Been Doing Over the Past Week Instead of Blogging</h3>

<ol>
<li>Cleaning up the house and changing sheets on the guest bed in preparation for a brief visit from the baby's godmother (my friend Sandra).</li>
<li>Buying a video camera (it's required when you have kids). </li>
<li>Attending (with godmother in tow) the baby shower my sister threw for Al and me at her house in Maryland. (My sister really outdid herself, I must say. Fabulous gig.)</li>
<li>Picking up essential items that we didn't receive as gifts at the shower (we specifically asked that the shower not be about getting gifts, but people got us some awesome &#8212;and much-needed&#8212;stuff anyway). What we still needed, and bought on Sunday with the Babies 'R Us gift card Sandra gave us: A changing pad, a diaper bag, some more receiving blankets, layette gowns, and a couple other random things. </li>
<li>Washing zillions of onesies and baby socks, crib sheets, receiving blankets, burp cloths, no-scratch mittens, and layette gowns. </li>
<li>Buying diapers.</li>
<li>Stocking the freezer with Smart Ones, the frozen grilled chicken sandwiches Al likes, and the Alvarado St. Bakery multigrain bread we both love; the pantry with casserole fixins (pasta, condensed soup, canned salmon) and canned fruit; and the closet with cleaning supplies for my mom.</li>
<li>Peeing every five minutes. </li>
<li>Framing and hanging the final photos, subway maps, and Paddington Bear drawings for the baby's room. (It's a travel-themed nursery.)</li>
<li>Mulling over the proposed platform for my new political party.</li>
<li>Addressing Christmas cards (which will double as birth announcements this year).</li>
<li>Writing thank-you notes.</li>
<li>Watching football. (I have Ben Roethlisberger, Jerome Bettis, and my personal favorite, Hines Ward, on my fantasy football roster, so I was thrilled to see the Steelers whup the Eagles this weekend. Sorry, Philadelphia.)</li>
<li>Staring at the Pack 'N Play at the foot of our bed (and the baby swing and bouncy seat in the living room,  the stroller frame in the dining room, and the car seat in&#8212;where else?&#8212;the car) and feeling a mix of excitement, fear, and horror. OH MY GOD, WE'VE BECOME TWO OF <em>THOSE</em> PEOPLE. WE HAVE BECOME <em>BREEDERS</em>. </li>
<li> Getting outside as much as possible during the day to combat the depression that's descending on me as the days get shorter and the belly gets bigger.</li>
<li>Planning all my trips up and down the stairs so I never have to go from the basement to the third floor in a single shot. </li>

<h3 class="title">Date With Destiny (or: Window of Opportunity)</h3>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/pinksweater_110904.jpg" alt="exposed belly, 11.09.04" width="174" height="599" class="inline-right" galleryImg="no" />Al and I have been purposely vague about the due date of our baby, mainly because well-meaning people are liable to drive you nuts with calendar watching if they know for sure when you're due. I've had a couple friends deliver early recently, but if I happen to go long (as another friend did&#8212;by about two weeks&#8212;last February), the last thing I want is zillions of &quot;did you have the baby yet???&quot; phone calls and e-mails. Thus, we've alternately told people that the baby was due &quot;in mid-December,&quot; &quot;around Christmas,&quot; and &quot;during the holidays.&quot; God help us if the magi reach the baby Jesus before our baby reaches us.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I posted a <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2004/07/toetouching_and.html">Due Date Debate</a> logic puzzle back in July, after we had our mid-pregnancy ultrasound and before we left on our <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/archives/cat_last_hurrah_cruise.html">Last Hurrah Cruise</a>. At the time, there had only been two guesses as to the delivery date&#8212;my grandmother's and my mom's&#8212;and both were based solely on our &quot;around Christmas&quot; assertion. When we returned from the cruise, I posted <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/000141.html">additional clues</a> based on the guesses that had come in via comments and e-mail while I was gone, and that update post got two more guesses via the comments. This weekend at the baby shower my sister had the guests record their guesses as to the date and time the baby would be born, as well as the baby's weight, length, hair color, and eye color at birth and his hair and eye color at one year. I can think of at least six people who were present at the shower who did not register guesses, but the guesses we did receive in the box set aside for the purpose,  from earliest to latest, are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>November 24 at 9:52am</li>
<li>November 27 at 8:28am </li>
<li>December 1 at 1:30pm</li>
<li>December 10 at 4:30am </li>
<li>December 12 at 3:45am</li>
<li>December 13 or 12 at 11:47am or pm</li>
<li>December 15 at 2:00pm</li>
<li>December 17 at 4:20am</li>
<li>December 22 at 6:05am</li>
</ul>
<p>
 <img src="/blog/images/gadgetry_111004.jpg" alt="covered belly, 11.10.04" width="252" height="581" class="inline-left" galleryImg="no" />Note that one of the guesses is my mom's, and one is my niece's (they've pretty much stuck to their original July/August estimates); I won't say to whom the others belong. Figuring from the date I think I conceived, all of the guesses above (as well as the ones from <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/000141.html">Jimmy, Josie, Lori, and Eric</a>) are within the 37- to 42-week range of a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;full-term&quot; pregnancy. It should be obvious now why we didn't give an exact due date; babies come when they want to, and only rarely when they're expected. 
</p>
<p>
 Keeping people guessing has also helped us be flexible in our thinking; it's partly how we've been able to get our act together so far in advance instead of always thinking, &quot;oh, we've got time.&quot;  We don't see a due date so much as an arrival window that pretty much spans the entire holiday season. It's why we are politely rejecting all offers to visit relatives in other states for Thanksgiving, and why our Christmas cards might not go out until January this year. It's why we voted heartily to do the tour of the labor and delivery floor at last night's childbirth class rather than waiting until the class with the pediatrician three weeks from now. It's why I'm determined to have my hospital bag packed by the end of the week.
</p>
<p>
In short, while there's probably no need to <em>worry</em> at this point if I go offline for a few days, there's probably cause to wonder... although I might be more sporadic about posting as I continue cleaning up around the house, start the search for a pediatrician (I'm behind on that front), and get caught up on some things I'd like to do before the baby arrives (like finish the book I'm reading, or do some Christmas shopping, or stock the cupboards and refrigerator with all the foods my mom thinks of as &quot;very simple and plain&quot; but that we'd never think to buy&#8212;things like squirt butter, iceberg lettuce  that doesn't come in a bag, and Turkey Hill Peanut Butter Ripple ice cream&#8212;in preparation for her after-birth visit). I was serious about mulling over a proposed platform for a new political party, but I'm not sure I'll have anything to post on that front for a while (unless the baby goes long and I continue to wake up at 3am on a regular basis, in which case I'll use the time between 3 and 5am for the next month to outline where I think the party should stand on trade, foreign policy, the economy, reproductive rights, and a host of other issues). 
</p>
<p>
One more point on the due date before I crawl back into bed and hope that I can fall back to sleep: I think part of the reason for the wide range of guesses, aside form any vagueness on our part, is that different people have different notions about what a woman in her 8th or 9th month of pregnancy should look like. Believe it or not, there are still people who don't notice I'm pregnant unless I tell them, and they seem utterly shocked when I say I'm due in December. My father-in-law, on the other hand, asked if I had &quot;two in there&quot; when he saw me on Saturday. (If he saw the woman in my childbirth class who *is* carrying twins&#8212;and who isn't due until February&#8212;he'd know better.) My aunt postulated that I wouldn't deliver anytime soon because I &quot;look too comfortable,&quot; but she obviously hasn't seen me rolling out of bed at 3am when my belly hurts too much to sleep. A woman in front of me at the spa last month decided that I was &quot;awfully small to be due in December&quot; and asked if I was carrying all in back. (I responded, &quot;um, would you like to walk around me and see?&quot;) Just as one woman who's 50% effaced and 1cm dilated may not deliver for another four weeks while another woman who's &quot;completely closed&quot; may go into labor the next day, some women  look three months pregnant when they go into labor, and some look twelve. I won't say which of the first two women I resemble most, but the three-months-pregnant-looking woman I had in mind was my mom&#8212;and I was 8lbs., 13oz.

<p>
For anyone who still believes that "moral values" were the leading issue in the election last week, consider that the "moral values" voters were only 1/5 of those polled. (It's not like this number is a mystery; it's just that everyone who quotes it&#8212;and all the major news organizations have&#8212;does so as if one fifth is a WHOPPING number. It's not.)
</p>

<p>
Frank Rich has an illuminating op-ed piece in the New York Times today on this very subject: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/arts/14rich.html?th" target="a8_win">On 'Moral Values,' It's Blue in a Landslide</a>. It's probably safe to read "blue" as a double entendre in this context, occasionally meaning Democratic (as in "blue states"), and occasionally meaning lewd or prurient (as in "the rather blue programming on Fox"). Give it a read.

<h3 class="title">November Pregnancy Update</h3>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/pinkbelly2.jpg" alt="Approaching blastoff" width="285" height="500" class="inline-right" galleryimg="no"> By the time I finish writing this, adding a photo, looking around for something to eat, pausing to do random Google searches, making notes about what I want to do today, and pasting the text of this entry from Dreamweaver into Movable Type, it'll probably be after 8am, but I want to say for the record that right now it's 5:53am. I'm exhausted, but sleeping apparently isn't on my body's agenda this morning. I'd say it wasn't on the baby's, either, but that was only while I was lying in bed&#8212;as soon as I got up and started moving around, of course, he stopped kicking me and fell asleep.
</p>
<p>
I know I usually do these updates during the last week of the month, but it feels like things are happening much more rapidly now. Al suggested last week that I start taking twice-weekly belly shots (instead of my usual once-weekly shots on Thursdays) because it seemed to be growing&#8212;or at least changing&#8212;every couple days. Doing the update now also gives me a chance to blog a bit, which as you may have noticed, I haven't been too good about lately. 
</p>
<p>
<b>I finally got a flu shot. </b>My sister came through for me: She begged her doctor's office to let me have one on the morning of our baby shower, and they gave in. Many thanks to my sister and to Carroll Family Medicine in Hampstead, MD for taking pity on a pregnant asthmatic from out of state.
</p>
<p>
<b>I've dropped (or rather, the baby has)</b>. At a recent office visit my belly measured a bit smaller than usual (well, the fundal height&#8212;the distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus&#8212;was shorter than expected), which led the doctor to surmise that the baby had dropped. She confirmed this by poking down low and hitting his head. The now-crowded space between my hipbones means that I often end up walking like a cowboy whenever I have to pee.
</p>
<p>
<b>I'm craving peppermint. </b>I know you're supposed to avoid peppermint when you're pregnant (and also when you have heartburn, incidentally) because it can stimulate contractions, but lately I've been wanting peppermint mochas, peppermint patties, peppermint brownies, peppermint tea... you name it, if it has mint (especially in combination with chocolate) in it, I want it. I also recently stocked up on Aveda peppermint rosemary shampoo and Organic Botanicals mint thyme body wash (my favorites), and I bought a mint-scented shampoo, body wash, conditioner, scrub, etc. travel set from H2O for my hospital bag. Mint, mint, MINT! Gimme the MINT! 
</p>
<p>
<b>I'm alternating between productive bursts of energy and supreme laziness. </b>As the baby books predicted I would, I've been having the urge to tackle major household projects as the due date approaches. Usually I end up paying for these spurts of activity by not being able to get off the couch the next day, though sometimes I go two days in a row bustling about before I crash. Last week's project was to Swiffer, vaccum, and wash all the wood floors in the house (basically every room except the basement and the bathrooms) and then finish setting up the baby's room; yesterday's was to remodel our downstairs bathroom. (I've always hated that scummy little bathroom and had planned to paint it eventually; when Annie died, we were able to remove the cat box and litter supplies, which provided the impetus to finally fix it up. Between 11:30am and 6:30pm yesterday, I removed the stupid medicine-chest mirror, painted all the walls the same blue as the kitchen, showered, went to Lowe's and purchased a new mirror, toilet seat, shelves, and towel ring, ate lunch in the car, returned to the house, scrubbed the sink and toilet, removed the old toilet seat and installed the new one, hung the shelves and mirror, and washed the floor. I still kinda can't believe it.) Today's project is to walk to the laundromat at 21st and Walnut and do three loads of laundry (our washing machine broke as I was doing the final load of baby clothes last week, and it won't be repaired until next Monday).
</p>
<p>
<b>The Nexium is working. </b>Within one day of my asthma doctor putting me on Nexium (yes, my asthma doctor; the nuclear heartburn was causing asthma attacks), I was virtually heartburn-free. I've only had one night where I had to wake up to take some TUMS, and that bout was sub-nuclear. Yay, Nexium!
</p>
<p>
<b>My belly button may never pop out. </b>This is one of the things we learned in our childbirth class, which is turning out to be most useful for asking all the questions we're dying to have answered but that we either feel too silly or don't have time to ask the obstetrician. According to the labor and delivery nurse who's teaching the class, her belly button popped out with her first kid, but not with the next two. Mine has gone from very deep to very shallow, but it's still an innie.
</p>
<p>
<b>This belly HURTS. </b>Over the course of the pregnancy I've often thought of <a href="http://www.dooce.com/" target="a8_win">Heather's</a> comment that <a href="http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/01_23_2004.html" target="a8_win">&quot;Sources close to the belly confirm that it does indeed hurt very much,&quot;</a> but never more so than now. By the time I get into bed at night, my belly is positively aching&#8212;and then the punchfest starts. I get feet in my ribs, punches and headbutts to the groin, and lots of flipping around in every direction. I love this baby, but he really needs to learn how to SETTLE DOWN.
</p>
<p>
<b>I'm not hot. </b>Everything I've read (and every woman I've talked to who's ever been pregnant) has said that I'd spend the third trimester (and especially the 9th month) sweating profusely and walking around in shorts even if it was really cold outside. I have not found this to be the case. In fact, I'm freezing. During the first trimester I overheated a lot, especially at night, but lately I've been more concerned with staying warm than with cooling off. This is somewhat problematic when I go outside (where daytime highs are now in the 40s and 50s) because none of my coats fit anymore. I ran into a woman who's due three days before me who, like me, didn't want to spend $200 on a maternity coat, and her solution was to buy a plus-size one at Burlington Coat Factory. Al &amp; I explored this option on Sunday, but as I am a different shape than the woman who gave me the tip, I wasn't able to find anything that fit. (It appears that I really am &quot;all belly,&quot; as people keep describing; I'm pretty normal-sized everywhere else.)
</p>
<p>
<b>I don't seem to be swelling (except in the belly, of course). </b>I don't know if this is related to the cold-bloodedness, but aside from a few varicose veins, I haven't experienced any swelling with this pregnancy. I can still get my rings on and off, and my shoes still fit. I feel pretty lucky on this front.
</p>
<p>
<strong>I think we're ready. </strong>The baby's room is all set up, I've got my bag mostly packed, and there's a list by the door of last-minute things to throw in the car or the suitcase (iPod + charger, birthing ball, pillows, etc.). I've got most of my mom's favorite foods in the house (although I haven't been able to find squirt butter or Turkey Hill Peanut Butter Ripple ice cream yet), and pretty much everything else on my To Do list (except finding a pediatrician) can be put on hold indefinitely if necessary. I won't run out of things to do over the next three to four weeks, but I think we're mostly prepared if the baby were to show up, say, tomorrow. This is not to say that we're completely ready to be parents&#8212;just that we've done all we can to make room for baby.

<p>
I don't know why it didn't occur to me that slowly lowering myself into a squat to paint along the baseboards in the bathroom on Monday&#8212;and then slowly raising myself back up, repeatedly&#8212;would be like doing squats at the gym while holding a 35 lb. medicine ball, but it didn't. Since midday yesterday I have been paying for that oversight.
</p>

<p>
If only I had known that I was straining the very muscles I'd need later to lower myself onto a couch or toilet seat, to climb stairs, and&#8212;god forbid I should need to anytime soon&#8212;push the baby out, I would have painted only the top half of the bathroom walls and installed a chair rail or something.

<h3 class="title">When You're Smiling</h3>

<p>
Remember how I said, months ago, that I couldn't get any other pregnant women to smile back at me? Well, now I'm getting smiled at all the time&#8212;by new moms. It seems like every woman I pass with a child under a year old flashes me with a knowing smile, like they can't wait to welcome me to the club. Meanwhile, I haven't noticed too many other pregnant women outside of my childbirth class; could it be that there are zillions of women in their second trimester who are busily smiling at me, and I'm not noticing them? Could they be writing in their blogs about how the very pregnant woman they passed on Market Street yesterday didn't smile back, and how it hurt their feelings?

<h3 class="title">Touch Me and You Die</h3>

<p>
I'd been reading (and laughing over) Julie's <a href="http://www.alittlepregnant.com/alittlepregnant/2004/11/put_that_ibacki.html" target="a8_win">Put. That. <em>Back.</em></a> post yesterday, and I must say I was intrigued by the role-playing exercise at the childbirth class. I wasn't sure if Julie was kidding about that or not... and then last night at my class, the instructor said, "at the end, we're going to do a mock labor!" I poked Al and said, "oh! I just read about this on the '<a href="http://www.alittlepregnant.com/" target="a8_win">a little pregnant</a>' woman's site!"
</p>

<p>
So I'm all excited about this... until the "mock labor" starts. Turns out it's not the role-playing thing at all. It's the standard "relaxation" exercises, only this time longer, with extra huffing and puffing that made me feel like I couldn't breathe (which in turn made  the asthmatic in me panic). I mentioned before that I don't find the relaxation exercises relaxing at all&#8212;in fact, I find them downright irritating&#8212;and as this "labor" progressed, I felt myself getting more and more ANGRY. And uncomfortable. And needing to pee.
</p>

<p>
I got up to relieve my bladder, and when I returned, instead of  getting back down on the floor, I sat in the chair behind Al, up against the wall. I was doing my best not to seethe at being duped into sticking around for this huff-and-puff session when our instructor said, "OH! I forgot about the thigh squeezing! Coaches: Remember how last time I had you squeeze your partners' thighs to simulate contractions? You should do that now. Al, you can turn around and face Lori in the chair and squeeze from where you're sitting." Al had barely turned his head toward me when I said, without moving any part of my body except my lips, "DON'T. TOUCH. ME." 
</p>

<p>
Luckily, Al knows me well enough that this response was not only not surprising, but fully expected. He kept his hands to himself and well away from my thighs. He confessed later that he'd wondered whether I'd left the class entirely when I stepped out to use the loo, and whether he should follow. I'm sure he would have if I'd been gone for more than 5 minutes. 
</p>

<p>
On a more positive (and somewhat related) note, the midwife mentioned to us at our last office visit that the hospital has a free doula service. We had wanted to use a doula, but I was a bit overwhelmed at the prospect of trying to find someone I trusted. (It's hard enough trying to find a pediatrician.) I'm excited to know that I might still be able to have one, especially since we're really going to need someone who can tell the hospital staff to SHUT UP AND LEAVE HER ALONE. I know Al could do it, but I don't want both of us getting uptight during the labor; one of us at least needs to stay calm and focused. I'm fully expecting that one to be Al.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Inept Already</h3>

<p>
So I don't remember if I mentioned this here or not, but a couple weeks ago, our washing machine broke. (A week to the day, incidentally, after our dryer had been repaired. Why, oh why, couldn't they have both broken&#8212;and been repaired&#8212;on the same day? I mean, they were obviously scheduled to break after four years, right? How hard would it have been to make sure that they broke on the same day?) 
</p>
<p>
I'd been washing the second and final load of baby clothes (and drying a load of regular clothes) when I noticed a burning smell coming from the laundry room.
Of course I assumed that it was the dryer burning, since that had just been fixed, and I wasn't entirely convinced that it had been fixed properly because the Check Lint Screen light remained on even after the repair. While sniffing around behind the dryer trying to discern from whence the burning smell was emanating, I noticed that the washer was in soak mode (that is, it was just sitting there, mid-cycle). I figured this was normal for delicates, but as I continued searching for the source of the burning smell, I realized that the washer had been in soak mode for a LONG TIME, and that the lights on the control panel actually indicated that it was Spinning, not Soaking.
</p>
<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we've found the source of the burning smell.
</p>

<p>
I ended up having to fish all the baby clothes out of the washer (which, thank god, had already run through the rinse cycle), wring them out as best I could, and dry them for about two hours. I then called Sears, scheduled a repair, and bailed out the washer *almost* all the way (the belly made it difficult to reach down to the bottom, and after carrying six buckets to the bathroom sink, I was tired). What usually happens when you schedule a repair with Sears (or at least, this was my experience with the dryer) is that the repair guy comes out, looks at your machine, declares that you need some part that must be ordered, and says he'll be back in a week. If you happen to get *our* repair guy, he will also call at 7:15 on the morning of the scheduled 8-12 repair window and say he'll be there between 7:30 and 7:45.
</p>

<p>
This is indeed what happened with the washer. After arriving at 7:45am last Monday, poking around in the control panel for a while, and asking to see my manual, the repair guy declared that we needed a new motor (something I could have guessed for myself, based on the burning smell and the fact that the washer would neither spin nor drain). He said it would come in a fairly large box and be heavy, and that he'd be back in a week to install it. (Keep in mind that at this point, we'd been laundryless for a week already.)
</p>

<p>
Twice last week I had to push my little-old-lady wire basket down to the laundromat at 21st and Sansom, contracting all the way, to do a total of four loads of laundry, so I wasn't the least bit annoyed when the repair guy called at 6:55 this morning to say that he'd be there between 7:15 and 7:30. Who cared that this man obviously had no sense of which hours actually fall between 8 and 12? I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO WASH CLOTHES AGAIN. IN MY OWN HOME. No tokens required, no funny smell on the clothes from the super-perfumed detergent the guy before you had used, no freaking out when a piece of your clean underwear falls onto the skanky laundromat floor as you pull your things out of the front-loaders. THIS is why you become a homeowner: To have your very own washer and dryer.
</p>

<p>
So the repair guy gets going around 7:30 this morning, and at quarter to 8 he comes upstairs looking for me. "Are you done already?" I ask, since it usually doesn't take him long to install parts. "Almost," he says, "but you've got something stuck in your pump, so I'll have to replace that too. I'm going out to get one off the truck [he actually had a part with him! it's a miracle!]; while I do that, can you find me a tub that's lower and smaller than a bucket?" I tried showing him a few options, but he didn't like any of them. He ended up asking if he could use a container that had a bunch of random desk stuff in it instead. I dumped it out, handed it to him, and said go ahead.
</p>
<p>
While he struggled with the basin and the pump, I asked how the pump could have gotten clogged. &quot;Overloading the washer, usually,&quot; he replied. I assure you, people, that this is something I NEVER DO. And I certainly hadn't done it with the baby clothes load... hm, wait a minute. Baby clothes. Small items. Is it possible something small had been sucked into the pump? Those of you with psychic powers already know the answer, right? Well, for those of you without psychic powers, the answer is YES! Yes, it is possible that something very small can be sucked into the pump EVEN IF YOU DON'T OVERLOAD THE WASHER. That small thing turned out to be... a single blue sock. &quot;Oh,&quot; I said, when the repair guy told me that the sock was the culprit. &quot;I guess maybe I have to hand wash those?&quot; &quot;Nope,&quot; he replied. &quot;Just get one of those mesh bags. See ya.&quot;
</p>
<p>
So it turns out that Sears is off the hook for not properly coordinating their washer/dryer breakdowns. They may have been at fault for the dryer, but it was me and my inept baby sock handling that took out the washer. I haven't even had the baby yet, and I'm already fucking up as a parent. This tip about the mesh bag wasn't in any of the books I've read so far (although it's true I haven't finished any of them yet). I called my sister to see if this was common knowledge among parents who do laundry, and she said, &quot;oh, I knew about the mesh bag, but I always thought it was so you didn't lose the socks.&quot; Right, INTO THE PUMP. So for those of you pregnant or soon-to-be-pregnant people who didn't know about the mesh bag, now is your chance to buy one and USE IT. You'll save yourself a lot of hassle with Sears (or with the owner of the laundromat if you're doomed to do your laundry in public). And, of course, you won't be stuck with one mateless blue sock.
</p>

<h3 class="title">I'm Still Pregnant, the Washing Machine is Still Broken, and the Closets are Still Being Repaired</h3>

<p>
I'm breaking my vow of radio silence to provide a quick update for anyone who was wondering if I'd rushed off to the hospital. I haven't; I'm still here, and still pregnant. And the washing machine is still broken. I put one load in after the repair guy left last Monday and then proceeded to start vacuuming the basement. When I got into the laundry room, I could hear the washing machine making a loud clicking noise over the sound of the vaccum, so I turned off the vacuum cleaner to investigate. That's when I noticed the motor sounded like a toy whose battery was running out.
</p>

<p>
I immediately dialed the number for Sears and stood in the laundry room, listening to the washer, while I waited on hold. By the time they got through to the local repair center and ascertained that the technician would not be able to return that day, I'd begun to smell the faint burning odor that had hearalded the demise of the motor two weeks previously. The operator told me the technican could return on December 1.
</p>

<p>
About five minutes later the technician called and said he'd gotten a message to call me, but without any details. I explained about the noises and the burning smell, and he said, "that's the motor overheating. You need to go stop the cycle, let the motor cool for about 30 minutes, and then run the Drain and Spin cycle to get the water out. I can't get back there today..." "I know," I said, "they scheduled me for the first." Him: "The first of what?" Me: "December." Him: "WHAT? When is THAT?" Me: "Um, a week from Wednesday." Him: "No, no, no. We're working tomorrow, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday this week. Call them back and tell them to put you on the schedule for tomorrow or Wednesday."
</p>

<p>
Long story short, after several phone calls between me and Sears, they finally agreed to schedule us for Friday the 26th. A different technician came out that day, and surprisingly, he had absolutely NO information on what had happened so far. "All I got was a message that 'technician said he wanted to come out tomorrow.'" Useful. I told him the story, he poked around for about an hour, and then&#8212;that's right!&#8212;declared that he'd have to order a part, and he'd be back next Friday.
</p>

<p>
DAMN THAT BABY SOCK!
</p>

<p>
I wasn't feeling well that day, so Al helped me take the four loads of laundry that had piled up over the past week down to the laundromat (we drove, thank god&#8212;I don't think I could have pushed my little old lady cart down there). It only took about half an hour to get everything washed, but of course it took the remainder of the afternoon to get everything dried (we did that at home). All I can say is that that damn washer better be fixed by the time I have the baby.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of things that need to be done by the time I have the baby: I can't remember if I mentioned here that we were having some work done on the closets in the master and guest bedrooms as well as having the front door replaced. We actually talked to the contractor about doing the work back in September, I believe, but scheduling and supply problems on his end meant that the work didn't start until November, when I explained the whole deal about the due date being more like a <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/000292.html">window of opportunity</a>, and that the window of opportunity to get the work done would be closing as soon as I brought the baby home from the hospital.
</p>

<p>
So the work on the closets is continuing this week, the front door will hopefully go in this week or next, the washing machine will be repaired&#8212;cross your fingers&#8212;on Friday, and I'll be back with a birth announcement and a follow-up post with all the gory details as soon as I can after junior arrives.
</p>

<p>
We now return to radio silence.
</p>
