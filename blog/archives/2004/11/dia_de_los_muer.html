<h3 class="title">Dia de Los Muertos</h3>

<p>
 Happy All Saints' Day, aka Day of the Dead, aka November 1st! We experienced our first Philadelphia Halloween last night, and while fairly different from our Mountain View Halloween experiences, it was a <a href="/halloween/archives/2004/index.html">great success</a>. Several friends and relatives outside of Philly have asked to see my Patrick Starfish costume, so here it is (click on the photos to see larger versions):
</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<table width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="15">
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/pink_klansman.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/pink_klansman.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/pink_klansman_half.jpg" alt="the pink klansman" width="200" height="300" galleryImg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">The original prototype, aka The Pink Klansman. The shirt is from the maternity department at Target, the hood is just a yard and a half of pink fleece pinned together, the gloves are pink wool-lined suede from Kohl's, and the lounge pants, turned inside out, are from Gap Body. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/now_with_mouth.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/now_with_mouth.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/now_with_mouth_half.jpg" alt="now, with mouth!" width="200" height="300" galleryImg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">We realized a fter taking the first photo that we'd need to put some stuffing in the pointy bit on top to keep it pointy. Since I couldn't see through the fleece, Al helped me mark where the eyeholes should go with tape. He got a bit ambitious and decided to mark where he thought the eyebrows and mouth should go as well.
I'm kind of amazed that this photo isn't blurry, because Al couldn't stop laughing as he was trying to take the picture.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/full_gig.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/full_gig.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/full_gig_half.jpg" alt="the full costume (no padding necessary in the belly area)" width="200" height="300" galleryImg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">The completed costume. Since I don't sew, everything that would otherwise have been sewn is held together with safety pins. The pink feet are toddler-sized pink tights cut in half, pulled over my clogs, and held up first with rubber bands (which cut off my circulation) and later with clear hockey tape (which stuck to my skin, but it was still better than the rubber bands). The belly is real (and I have to say, this is probably the first time I felt really skinny while pregnant&#8212;the real Patrick is much shorter and wider on the bottom than I am). </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/super_patrick.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/super_patrick.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/super_patrick_half.jpg" alt="this is before we pinned back the extra hood material" width="200" height="300" galleryimg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">The eyeholes are behind the pupils (and thus they're very small). I realized as I was painting the hood that Patrick's head wasn't as pointy as I'd thought, so I tucked the point in a bit. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/blogging.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/blogging.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/blogging_half.jpg" alt="Patrick takes blogging very seriously" width="200" height="300" galleryImg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">This is me attempting to blog about all our trick-or-treaters with the hood on. Thank god I know how to touch type. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="/halloween/images/smiling.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('/halloween/images/smiling.html','patrick','menubar=yes,width=400,height=600');return false;"><img src="/halloween/images/smiling_half.jpg" alt="smile, Patrick!" width="200" height="300" galleryimg="no" /></a></td>
<td align="left">Again, Al was totally cracking up as he took this photo. I couldn't decide what he thought was funnier: the costume, or the fact that I was blogging in it. </td>
</tr>
