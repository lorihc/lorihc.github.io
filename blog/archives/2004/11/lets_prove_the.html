<h3 class="title">Let's Prove the Pundits Wrong</h3>

<p>
How many people think that tomorrow's election will be a blowout?
</p>

<p>
Well, maybe not a blowout, but a lot closer than all the pundits are predicting? I contend that it could happen. I believe&#8212;and this could just be wishful thinking on my part, I admit&#8212;that I will wake up on November 3 and know who the next president will be. (Although it's true that many states will be counting absentee ballots well into next week.)
</p>

<p>
I even believe&#8212;and again, this could be liberal coast wishful thinking&#8212;that not only will the win be decisive, but that the winner will be John Kerry. As <a href="http://www.zogby.com/" target="a8_win">John Zogby</a> said on the Daily Show the other night, "if the election were between Bush and Not Bush, Not Bush would win." It gets a little more complicated when there's no Not Bush option&#8212;only Kerry, Nader, and a few other random candidates&#8212;but I think reasonable people who aren't giant fans of Kerry can hold their noses and vote for him anyway as, at worst, the lesser of two evils, and at best, a force for change.
</p>

<p>
I hate that I'll be holding my nose and voting for a couple candidates in my state and local elections whom I otherwise wouldn't support&#8212;mainly because they're less scary than the alternative&#8212;but I'd rather do it than wake up and find that the alternative had won.
</p>

<p>
Please get out and vote tomorrow. <strong>Your vote really does count. </strong>And though I might question your sanity if you vote for Bush rather than Not Bush, I will applaud you for performing your civic duty and participating in the political process. I'd rather be proven wrong on my blowout prediction and find that this country really is divided right down the middle into two camps, than to find it's really divided into three: good, bad, and indifferent. For those of you already squarely in the Not Bush camp, help prove me right. Let's go for the blowout.
</p>
