<h3 class="title">22% Does Not a Mandate Make</h3>

<p>
For anyone who still believes that "moral values" were the leading issue in the election last week, consider that the "moral values" voters were only 1/5 of those polled. (It's not like this number is a mystery; it's just that everyone who quotes it&#8212;and all the major news organizations have&#8212;does so as if one fifth is a WHOPPING number. It's not.)
</p>

<p>
Frank Rich has an illuminating op-ed piece in the New York Times today on this very subject: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/arts/14rich.html?th" target="a8_win">On 'Moral Values,' It's Blue in a Landslide</a>. It's probably safe to read "blue" as a double entendre in this context, occasionally meaning Democratic (as in "blue states"), and occasionally meaning lewd or prurient (as in "the rather blue programming on Fox"). Give it a read.
