<h3 class="title">We're Not *That* Old!</h3>

<p>
Something's fishy in Philadelphia. I don't know what mailing list Al got on recently, but yesterday we received a photo of George W. and Laura Bush in the mail, thanking us in advance for our support of the Republican campaign in Pennsylvania, and today Al got a membership card for AARP.
</p>

<p>
OK, so we might be investing a bit conservatively these days, but that doesn't mean we'll be voting conservatively. As for AARP, I'm completely puzzled. Could it be that at the same time the Social Security Administration is raising the retirement age, AARP is lowering the age at which you're considered a senior citizen? (And could they really be lowering it from 55 to 36?)

<p>I had no idea you were a "Bushie". Ha! Hope you are feeling better.</p>

<p>I finally read "The Red Tent" last week. I really enjoyed it. Ann is reading it now.</p>

<p>Take care.</p>

<p>C'mon now, Lori! We'll still love you if you gave Dubya a little under the table!! Even better, though...two of my co-workers are married to foreigners who have not become US citizens yet, and their husbands both received a picture of Dubya with a thank you for supporting the Republican Party!</p>

<p>Hope you are both doing well!</p>

<p>I got the Bush mailing with the photo too, and I'm registered Green.  I don't know what they were thinking.  Possibly they assume all property owners are potential Republicans?</p>

<p>The funniest thing to me was that the form to fill out to donate money didn't actually fit in the return envelope.  I had to fold it twice to squeeze it in.  (I mailed it back to them with a note asking to be removed from their mailing list; I figure might as well cost them some postage.)</p>

<p>You know what's weird? Everyone I've heard from/about who's gotten the mailer is male. I get just as much junk mail as Al (if not more), and yet the Republicans didn't think it worth soliciting me for money.</p>

<p>Good to hear from you, Jed!!</p>

<p>You're not that old, and probably not rich enough to benefit to his tax cuts.</p>

<p>I got one of those in the mail for the previous renters (who left over a year and a half ago). It said "Photo enclosed, do not bend" So I folded it up nice and tight, made sure to crease the edges and scrawled "NOT AT THIS ADDRESS" in heavy letters with a ball-point pen on the address label. I put it in the outgoing mail clip thingee and left it for the postman.  It never would have fit in the clip if I didn't fold it.</p>

<p>Yup, Ken Sundermeyer got a Bush photo, too.  The CT team put it on the dartboard.</p>
