<h3 class="title">Down, But Not Out</h3>

<p>
I haven't felt many strong urges to update this site lately (except during the Presidential press conference the other night); mostly I've been writing for myself, not for public consumption. I'm still recovering from a nasty bout of bronchitis, and it's left me a bit tired and listless.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that after a week of rain, spring has finally sprung in Philadelphia. I've managed to get out of the house and walk a bit over the past few days, and yesterday I re-potted our tomato, pepper, and swiss chard sprouts (I grew them from seed). I really should go to Home Depot today and get some more soil so I can get the rest of the sprouts out into the 80&deg; sunshine, but the Red Sox are playing the Yankees on ESPN-HD, and I'm expecting a UPS delivery this afternoon.
</p>

<p>
On Wednesday I'm planning to drive up to Hunter, NY to see my grandmother, and this weekend my in-laws will be visiting us for the first time in Philadelphia. I'm still not sure how I'm going to deal with this flurry of human interaction, after being quiet and cocooned for the last couple weeks...

<h3 class="title">We're Not *That* Old!</h3>

<p>
Something's fishy in Philadelphia. I don't know what mailing list Al got on recently, but yesterday we received a photo of George W. and Laura Bush in the mail, thanking us in advance for our support of the Republican campaign in Pennsylvania, and today Al got a membership card for AARP.
</p>

<p>
OK, so we might be investing a bit conservatively these days, but that doesn't mean we'll be voting conservatively. As for AARP, I'm completely puzzled. Could it be that at the same time the Social Security Administration is raising the retirement age, AARP is lowering the age at which you're considered a senior citizen? (And could they really be lowering it from 55 to 36?)
