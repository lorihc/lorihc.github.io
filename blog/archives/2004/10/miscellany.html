<p>
A few random items:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.blurbomat.com/archives/2004/10/24/endorsement.html" target="a8_win">dj blurb</a> opened up comments on his endorsement post, and I loved reading <s>all</s> most of the different points of view. (Most&#8212;but not all&#8212;commenters support Kerry, but whom each person supports not as interesting as <em>why</em>.)</li>
<li>Al and I start childbirth classes tonight. This week's pregnancy newsletter from <a href="http://www.parentsplace.com/" target="a8_win">ParentsPlace.com</a> seemed to suggest that I'd be nervous about the birth by now, but for some reason I'm not.</li>
<li>I am loving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743255453/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill</a>. Fascinating book that is helping me make the distinction between Bush and his inner circle and other, honest Republicans whose views simply differ from mine (or don't, actually). I've been reading huge sections of it out loud to Al, a sure sign that it's a life-changing read (similar to <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/books/index.html?bookID=46">And the Band Played On</a> and <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/books/index.html?bookID=1">Nickel and Dimed</a>).</li>
<li>I am not a designer. <a href="http://www.hchamp.com/other/archives/000201.html" target="a8_win">So sue me.</a></li>
<li>As promised, I converted the <a href="/halloween/">all hallows eve</a> blog (and its archives) to Movable Type last night. I can't wait until Sunday!</li>
<li>I'm making headway (literally) on my Patrick costume; I got his eyes, eyebrows, and mouth done last night, and I'm looking less like a klansman. This afternoon's project: painting purple flowers on his bermuda shorts (actually a pair of green Gap Body sweatpants, pinned up a few inches).</li>
<li>Warning: There will be another post about Annie later today. With photographs.</li>
<li>Today is my 36th birthday. And I feel fine.</li>
