<p>Holy crap, there's a baby in there!  Can Al feel him move yet?  My wife and I were about 6 weeks behind you and so far, I haven't been fortunate enough to feel movement yet.  Of course, maybe she is just holding out on me because I tease her for having to do the "two-stage-stand-up" when she gets up out of a chair.  :)  Glad all is going well though!</p>

<p>Yes, there *is* a baby in there! I can feel his whole body moving now (and so can Al). I used to put Al's hand in a specific spot to feel the baby, but now the movements are all over the map, so he misses more. What he does feel is pretty amazing, he says. (Feels that way to me, too.)</p>
