<h3 class="title">Return of the Reviews</h3>

<p>
A while back I decided to revive my <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/books/">book reviews</a> by moving the existing reviews to a mySQL database and adding new ones. The database was on the fritz for a few months, which put a damper on reviewing books as I read them, but now that it's back up and working again, I've decided to link my "Additional Reading" titles to the reviews rather than to Amazon.com.
</p>

<p>
Here's how it will work: The heading, "Additional Reading", will always be linked to the main review page. The book I'm currently reading (and therefore haven't reviewed yet), will link to Amazon.com, so you can see what it's about. The remaining books in the list (usually the last five or so that I've read) will be linked to their individual reviews. Hope you find the reviews somewhat useful, and that they lead you to some worthwhile titles. If you think you can discern my taste from them, feel free to make recommendations by e-mailing me (given that I own this domain, and you know my name, you can probably guess my e-mail address :).
