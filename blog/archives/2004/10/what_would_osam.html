<h3 class="title">What Would Osama bin Laden Do?</h3>

<p>
Among the comments on blurbomat's <a href="http://www.blurbomat.com/archives/2004/10/24/endorsement.html" target="a8_win">endorsement post</a> from a few days ago was this one from a woman named Melissa:
</p>

<blockquote>
I support Bush for national security...like it or not under the Democrat presidency of Clinton, military/intelligence spending was cut so drastically that this country could not defend itself. Historically the Democrats are not big on a strong military presence. Ask yourself who Al Queda, Saddam, Ossama would vote for...KERRY...so I have to vote against them.
</blockquote>

<p>
According to a blurb on the front page of the <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/dailynews/" target="a8_win">Philadelphia Daily News</a> web site right now, Melissa appears to be slightly off the mark:
</p>

<blockquote>
Today's Washington Times reports that in Iraq, "foreign extremists prefer Bush, because he's a provocative figure, and the more they can push people to the extreme, the better for their case." Hmmmmm. Who are those foreign extremists in Iraq? Will Bunch says it's al Qaeda, and challenges you to come up with a differing valid interpretation of that quote.
</blockquote>

<p>
You can find Will Bunch's analysis of the <cite>Washington Times</cite> article in its entirety at <a href="http://www.pnionline.com/dnblog/extra/archives/001136.html" target="a8_win">Campaign Extra</a>.
