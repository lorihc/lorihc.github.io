<h3 class="title">A Second Term: The Second Coming?</h3>

<p>
Ron Suskind, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743255461/avocado8/ref%3Dnosim/" target="a8_win">The Price of Loyalty</a>, wrote a fascinating piece for yesterday's New York Times Magazine called "Without a Doubt" (link via <a href="http://www.acutor.be/silt/" target="a8_win">Silt</a>, via my well-read neighbor, <a href="http://rittenhouse.blogspot.com/" target="a8_win">Mr. Rittenhouse</a>). It's about the role of faith in the Bush White House&#8212;the kind of faith, as George Seaton (and Kris Kringle, in Miracle on 34th Street) put it, that is "believing in things when common sense tells you not to."
</p>

<p>
I don't know about you, but I'd prefer a president with faith *and* common sense. A guy who goes with his gut, but only after careful analysis. I've made several leaps of faith in my life&#8212;buying a house when the numbers didn't add up, because I felt like there was something around the bend that would make it all work out; agreeing to bear a child when I wasn't entirely sure I could endure childbirth, much less parenthood; moving to new cities where I didn't know a single person, without a job and with only a couple hundred dollars in my pocket&#8212;so I'm comfortable with a president who occasionally says, "I know this seems odd, but it feels right." 
</p>

<p>
However, it's difficult for me to get behind someone who says, "Look, I know I'm right, and I'm not going to justify it for you" about every decision he makes. Especially someone who clearly ignores&#8212;even derides&#8212;evidence, analysis, and debate. There's room for faith in the White House, for belief in a higher power, for prayer, for instincts, for going with your gut. But there must also be room&#8212;a whole floor would be nice&#8212;for discussion, deliberation, and examining opposing views. It's OK to admit that there are things that you don't know&#8212;that you cannot know&#8212;but you must also make an effort to learn what you can. As President, it's your responsibility to be informed.
</p>

<p>
Vaara selected <a href="http://www.acutor.be/silt/index.php?id=557" target="a8_win">a particularly shocking quote from the article</a> to highlight on his site, one in which a Bush aide accused Suskind of being part of "the reality-based community." Several other quotes from the article caught my attention, including this one:
</p>

<blockquote>
And for those who don't get it? That was explained to me in late 2002 by Mark McKinnon, a longtime senior media adviser to Bush, who now runs his own consulting firm and helps the president. He started by challenging me. &quot;You think he's an idiot, don't you?&quot; I said, no, I didn't. &quot;No, you do, all of you do, up and down the West Coast, the East Coast, a few blocks in southern Manhattan called Wall Street. Let me clue you in. We don't care. You see, you're outnumbered 2 to 1 by folks in the big, wide middle of America, busy working people who don't read The New York Times or Washington Post or The L.A. Times. And you know what they like? They like the way he walks and the way he points, the way he exudes confidence. They have faith in him. And when you attack him for his malaprops, his jumbled syntax, it's good for us. Because you know what those folks don't like? They don't like you!&quot; In this instance, the final &quot;you,&quot; of course, meant the entire reality-based community.
</blockquote>

<p>
It's a lengthy piece, but worth the time. Whether you consider yourself religious, spiritual, agnostic, or atheistic, please also consider that the word "faith," as used by the Bush administration, might not mean what you think it does&#8212;and that having the Messiah running your country might not be the best thing for the world.
