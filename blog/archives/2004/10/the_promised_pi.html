<h3 class="title">The Promised Pictorial</h3>

<p>
I mentioned that there would be an upcoming post with Annie photos; this is it. A couple weeks before she died, I had the idea to create a catalog of Annie's various poses and positions and our names for them. It was something I figured I'd work on eventually; I didn't realize then that I wouldn't have time to take pictures of any as-yet-unphotographed poses.
</p>

<p>
In going through all our Annie photos to work through our grief and create a screensaver for the Mac laptop, I found examples of many of the common poses, as well as several moments that were just plain sweet. <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/annie/annie.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/annie/annie.html','annie','scrollbars=yes,width=500,height=670');return false;">I've compiled them here</a>.
