<h3 class="title">Debate II</h3>

<p>
Impressions of tonight's debate, the first part of which I heard on the radio while in the car (everything up to domestic policy), and the second part of which I'm currently watching on TiVo (everything from domestic policy on):
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'd rather listen on the radio than watch on TV, though being able to pause and think about/discuss points made is nice. I'm finding Bush creepily defensive&#8212;at the rate he's screeching his responses, he won't have a voice left by the end&#8212;and that impression is heightened when I have to watch him walking around, gesturing at the crowd. When I was listening on the radio, I pictured both candidates sitting still, which was a much more pleasant image.</li>
<li>Heh heh... he said internet<em>s</em>, heh heh.</li>
<li>During the radio portion, we got a giggle out of the fact that I beat Bush to saying, "I've met with these guys!" by about a second in response to a foreign policy question. I knew he was going to say it because that's the phrase he fell back on time and again during the first debate to prove that he's a world leader.</li>
<li>Bush has obviously stepped up his game for this debate... but Kerry also stepped up his. Kerry has done a great job of attacking Bush while remaining completely dignified. Bush just seems like an angry bee.</li>
<li>Bush's 30-second responses can be summed up with a single phrase: "because I say so!" I can't believe he really thinks that repeating allegations Kerry just thoroughly rebutted is a good idea. Maybe he thinks that having the last word is more important than that word being reasonable or logical or even true?</li>
<li>Kerry just gave a brilliant answer on a question about abortion... and Bush responded by saying he supported (a completely unconstitutional) ban on partial birth abortions. (Bush's response also caused a fight between me and my husband over the Laci Peterson law, which Bush also bragged about supporting. I think it's a thinly-disguised attempt to establish a fetus as a human being with individual rights separate from the mother's, and that it doesn't do anything to prevent violence against pregnant women; Al thinks that adding a second charge of murder on behalf of the fetus will actually deter someone from killing a pregnant woman.)</li>
<li>I could swear I saw Kerry playing tic tac toe on his notepad while Bush was speaking about tort reform.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some interesting things I learned tonight:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Kerry has a plan for everything.</li>
<li>Congress did all the spending that created the multitrillion-dollar deficit. Bush did all the spending that made our lives better.</li>
<li>Senator Kennedy is the most liberal member of the Senate. (This is not surprising, but do wonder why Bush would mention it during a debate with Senator Kerry.)</li>
<li>You don't need a plan to create jobs if you have an energy plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>In his responce to question about what kind of a Supreme Court justice he would consider appointing should the need arise,I found his referance to "Dred Scott" bizarre. </p>

<p>George brought it up to say that slavery was not in the constitution and that judges had inserted their personal opinions to make slavery legal, which is actually completely backwards.</p>

<p>I've since heard that he brought up "Dred Scott" as a way of speaking in code to the anti-choice crowd. They like to assert that "Dred Scott" in some way is the same as denying a fetus it's rights. </p>

<p>So, even though he got it wrong, he got his message out to the extremeists. "I'll appoint a judge to the Supreme Court that will take away a woman's right to choose."</p>

<p>Apparently you are quite correct--that the only people who found the reference to Dred Scott baffling were liberals like us. See the Slate article "Why Bush Opposes Dred Scott -- It's code for Roe v. Wade" at  <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2108083/" rel="nofollow"><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2108083/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2108083/</a></a> for more info.</p>
