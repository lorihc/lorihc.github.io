Yep, it's that time of year again: October, otherwise known as "Breast Cancer Awareness Month." By all means, be aware. Know that breast cancer still kills millions. That mammograms are great for detecting breast cancer, but they don't prevent it. That racing for the cure will make you feel great and will give you a chance to get informed, but it won't get much money into research for an actual cure.
</p>

<p>
By all means, <a href="http://www.bcaction.org/Pages/GetInformed/GetInformed.html" target="a8_win">get educated</a>. And please, be an educated consumer. When a company puts a pink ribbon on a product, ask them where the money goes&#8212;and how much.
</p>

<p>
By all means, buy Yoplait yogurts if you like them&#8212;but don't bother mailing back three pink lids in an envelope with a 37-cent stamp on it. You'd be better off sending 67 cents (or better yet, $5, $10, $50) directly to <a href="http://www.breastcancerfund.org/site/pp.asp?c=kwKXLdPaE&b=43969" target="a8_win">a breast cancer charity</a> and skipping the middleman. Feel free to test drive the BMW, buy the Avon lipstick, use the Eureka vacuum. But if you really want to do something for yourself *and* find a cure for breast cancer, skip the car, the makeup, and the dirt sucker and go straight for the tax deduction.

<h3 class="title">I Met Rittenhouse Guy!</h3>

<p>
Just realized I left this on Draft rather than Publish, which is why it's showing up suddenly between the pink ribbon post and the one on the vice presidential debate...
</p>

<p>
This morning I got over my in-person shyness (I'm fine over e-mail, but dialing telephones and meeting people in person sometimes scare the shit out of me) and actually called my new neighbor Jim Capozzolla, of the <a href="http://rittenhouse.blogspot.com/" target="a8_win">Rittenhouse Review</a>. Of course, I then went on to embarrass myself completely by ordering a drink that made even the cashier at Startbucks shake her head and laugh (a decaf grande 2-pump 2% mocha, for the record; I like chocolate with my coffee, but not sugar, so I try to split the difference by asking for less than half the usual amount of chocolate syrup). Jim went with a much more straightforward large drip coffee.
</p>

<p>
We then found a spot near the window and talked about everything from books, politics, and living in Philadelphia to our families, significant others, and employment histories (and several topics in between). It was a pretty wide-ranging conversation, now that I think of it; at the time, I just enjoyed it. So often we feel like we know people because we read their blogs&#8212;and actually, I think having read each other's blogs did make it easier to jump into a conversation in mid-stream rather than starting from scratch&#8212;but meeting someone in person is an altogether different thing. In this case, a very pleasant thing.
</p>

<p>
In short: tasty coffee, tasty pastries, tasty conversation. I'll be getting out from behind my keyboard to knock on Jim's door again soon. (And next time, I hope I get to meet Mildred!)
</p>

<p>
This is what I hear when Dick Cheney is talking: Blah blah blah murmur murmur blah blah murmur murmur blah blah blah... blah.
</p>

<p>
This is what I hear when John Edwards is talking: What John Kerry should have said.
</p>

<p>
Other random observations as I watch the debate:
</p>

<ul>
<li>When I *am* able to distinguish words while Cheney is talking, he's saying things that should be valid criticisms of Kerry and Edwards&#8212;and yet they're falling like punches in a dream. They never seem to land.</li>

<li>I'm a little unnerved by how Edwards keeps addressing Cheney directly (and I think Cheney finds it downright irritating).</li>

<li>Edwards is really good at summing up when that red light comes on. And just when I think he's so far off the subject of the question that he's practically on another planet, he somehow turns the ship back toward earth and makes everything he's just said seem relevant by using the keywords from the question. Impressive.</li>

<li>I'm hating this moderator. Her questions are overly complex and asked too quickly. Bring back slow and steady Jim Lehrer!</li>

<li>And speaking of the moderator, is it just me, or is she putting Cheney on the spot more than she's putting Edwards on it? Or is Edwards just better at answering the questions (and deflecting the implied criticisms)?</li>

<li>Gah, what the fuck are you doing, Edwards? Cheney just gave you a golden opportunity on the AIDS question by focusing on the $15 billion the Bush administration appropriated for AIDS treatment *overseas*, when the moderator asked *specifically* about the *domestic* AIDS problem among black men&#8212;and then admitting that he didn't know much about the domestic AIDS problem. Instead of jumping on that and talking about domestic AIDS policy, you talked about Africa! IDIOT! Forget what I said before about your ability to come back to the topic at hand. You're starting to suck.</li>

<li>I think I just figured out why I was hearing "blah blah blah murmur murmur, blah blah, murmur murmur murmur" from Cheney before: he keeps cupping his hands under his chin&#8212;and covering the lap mike on his tie.</li>

<li>Is it bad that we're starting to feel sorry for Cheney? Could the fact that he's starting to seem pathetic work in his favor somehow?</li>

<li>Was that ripping noise Edwards tearing off strips of paper with which to make spitballs?</li>

</ul>

<h3 class="title">The Belly Continues to Expand</h3>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/belly_100704.jpg" alt="the belly is taking over" width="252" height="480" border="0" class="inline-left" galleryimg="no" />I went for another office visit with the obstetricians today. My impression of the front desk staff did not improve with our first afternoon visit, partly because the waiting room was mobbed and there was complete chaos up front, and partly because one of the desk chairs was being filled by a temp. He seriously got a deer-in-the-headlights look when I told him I needed to leave a urine sample. At first he said, &quot;pardon?&quot; as if he hadn't heard me right, or perhaps in lieu of saying, &quot;why are you telling me?&quot; I repeated myself, and explained that it's standard procedure with every visit. He then jumped out of his chair and started looking through the supply cabinet behind the desk, which contained reams of paper, pens, pencils, paperclips, and other standard office stuff. When I realized he was looking for specimen cups, I said, &quot;I just need the sticker with my name and birthdate on it&#8212;there are cups in the bathroom.&quot; That's when the other, regular receptionist stepped in to help him; she pointed to the folder in his hand and told him to peel off one of the stickers inside for me.
</p>
<p>
Of course, by this time someone had gone into the waiting room bathroom, and I was denied the opportunity to empty my extremely full bladder. Before I could set down my bag (and 10 minutes before my scheduled appointment), I was called for my weigh-in&#8212;which kind of pissed me off, since I knew I'd end up weighing about a pound more than I should on account of the aforementioned full bladder. I was then led back to the super-tiny exam room, where the medical assistant prepared to take my blood pressure. At this point I must admit I was starting to lose it; I'd walked to my appointment at an overly-brisk pace in warmer-than-expected weather to find that they'd turned off the air conditioning in the office for the winter, and I hadn't had time to sit down, cool off, or empty my bladder. I had no doubt that my blood pressure would be higher just from the annoyance. I begged to be allowed to pee before being cuffed and squeezed. 
</p>
<p>
My blood pressure was indeed elevated (though only slightly&#8212;110/68 instead of the usual 100/60), but I got a chance to cool my body and my temper a bit in the 30-minute wait before Dr. Wu came in. I liked her as much as last time, and Al liked her too (this was his first time meeting her). Although I've gained a significant amount of weight (basically the top of the recommended range), she didn't bug me about it&#8212;probably because my glucose levels, blood count, and blood pressure are all excellent, as are the baby's growth and heart rates.
</p>
<p>
I had a bunch of other things I was going to say about the questions we asked and the answers we got, but in reading over what I wrote in my (private) pregnancy journal, I realize that posting that info on the Internet probably isn't the wisest thing to do. I don't want to start a debate on whether certain things are dangerous or bad, or to invite horror stories about pre-term labor or other complications. Everything so far is fine with me, and my pregnancy has been described on numerous occasions as &quot;going really well.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
I will say that Dr. Wu clarified whether we have any choice in who delivers the baby. She said it's basically whoever's on call when I go into labor; the only time you really get any say is when you're overdue and have to schedule an induction. This doesn't really bother us... except that we still haven't met most of the doctors in the practice. Usually when we try to make an appointment, we get the nurse practitioner&#8212;whom we really like, but who doesn't do deliveries. Our next appointment is with the midwife; we've already seen her once, but we didn't really get a strong feeling about her because the visit lasted only about five minutes. I'm hoping that there are enough visits left for us to meet the remaining doctors, so we don't get a crazy stranger yelling &quot;PUSH!&quot; in December.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Not Just Not the Party of Fiscal Responsibility</h3>

<p>
It's always bugged me that the Republican Party has a reputation of being the party of fiscal responsibility, since they obviously can't balance a budget to save their lives. (Heck, I wonder if they could even balance a checkbook.) I found it particularly amusing that in the first presidential debate, Bush shook his head and laughed at Kerry's long list of proposals, wondering how he was going to pay for them... and then proceeded to brag about how much his administration has spent over the past four years. And how did *you* pay for this spending, Mr. Bush? Oh, that's right, you didn't! You're sticking our kids with the bill!
</p>

<p>
Now it turns out that the Republicans are not only not the party of fiscal responsibility; they're also not the party of smaller government. In <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/article.aspx@docID=272" target="a8_win">FactCheck.org</a>'s (not <a href="http://www.factcheck.com/" target="a8_win">factcheck.com</a>, as a certain VP mis-identified it, although I encourage you to visit that site as well) analysis of claims made by the two candidates in the vice presidential debate, I found this interesting note about job creation/loss during the past four years:
</p>

<blockquote>
Edwards said 1.6 million private sector jobs and 2.7 million manufacturing jobs had been lost during the Bush administration. Both figures are accurate, but omit <em>the growth in employment by federal, state and local governments.</em> The net loss in total employment is actually 913,000 as of August, the most recent figures available. [Emphasis added.]
</blockquote>

<p>
I have to admit that this was a bit of a shocker: Federal, state, and local government payrolls have actually *grown* over the past four years. Don't get me wrong&#8212;I certainly have no objection to jobs being created, or to improving our national security. I just think that if you're still an undecided voter, one that's attracted to the goals of fiscal responsibility and smaller government, you might give some thought as to whether Republicans are really committed to those goals&#8212;or whether they're just saying they are. (And what else might they be saying in hopes that you'll believe it?)

<h3 class="title">Debate II</h3>

<p>
Impressions of tonight's debate, the first part of which I heard on the radio while in the car (everything up to domestic policy), and the second part of which I'm currently watching on TiVo (everything from domestic policy on):
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'd rather listen on the radio than watch on TV, though being able to pause and think about/discuss points made is nice. I'm finding Bush creepily defensive&#8212;at the rate he's screeching his responses, he won't have a voice left by the end&#8212;and that impression is heightened when I have to watch him walking around, gesturing at the crowd. When I was listening on the radio, I pictured both candidates sitting still, which was a much more pleasant image.</li>
<li>Heh heh... he said internet<em>s</em>, heh heh.</li>
<li>During the radio portion, we got a giggle out of the fact that I beat Bush to saying, "I've met with these guys!" by about a second in response to a foreign policy question. I knew he was going to say it because that's the phrase he fell back on time and again during the first debate to prove that he's a world leader.</li>
<li>Bush has obviously stepped up his game for this debate... but Kerry also stepped up his. Kerry has done a great job of attacking Bush while remaining completely dignified. Bush just seems like an angry bee.</li>
<li>Bush's 30-second responses can be summed up with a single phrase: "because I say so!" I can't believe he really thinks that repeating allegations Kerry just thoroughly rebutted is a good idea. Maybe he thinks that having the last word is more important than that word being reasonable or logical or even true?</li>
<li>Kerry just gave a brilliant answer on a question about abortion... and Bush responded by saying he supported (a completely unconstitutional) ban on partial birth abortions. (Bush's response also caused a fight between me and my husband over the Laci Peterson law, which Bush also bragged about supporting. I think it's a thinly-disguised attempt to establish a fetus as a human being with individual rights separate from the mother's, and that it doesn't do anything to prevent violence against pregnant women; Al thinks that adding a second charge of murder on behalf of the fetus will actually deter someone from killing a pregnant woman.)</li>
<li>I could swear I saw Kerry playing tic tac toe on his notepad while Bush was speaking about tort reform.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some interesting things I learned tonight:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Kerry has a plan for everything.</li>
<li>Congress did all the spending that created the multitrillion-dollar deficit. Bush did all the spending that made our lives better.</li>
<li>Senator Kennedy is the most liberal member of the Senate. (This is not surprising, but do wonder why Bush would mention it during a debate with Senator Kerry.)</li>
<li>You don't need a plan to create jobs if you have an energy plan.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Missed Opportunities</h3>

<p>
Slate magazine has an <a href="http://www.slate.com/Default.aspx?id=2107963&" target="a8_win">interesting analysis of how Kerry blew the second presidential debate</a> by William Saletan (link via <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/tritone/" target="a8_win">nj</a>). As much as I think Bush is an idiot as a debator, I have to say I agree that Kerry is even worse at taking advantage of what Saletan calls hanging sliders (and what I called <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/000178.html">pucks flying through the slot</a> after the first debate).
</p>

<p>
Kerry gave <em>interesting</em> responses, but they often weren't the ones I expected. WHY, oh WHY is he incapable of explaining the "first I voted for the $87 billion before I voted against it" remark, for example? (Bush even got the attack wrong this time, somewhat hilariously: "He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it. And that sends a confusing signal to people." Um, no, sir&#8212;I think it's you who are confused.) It's a simple explanation, one that Edwards gave in 30 seconds or less during the vice-presidential debate, but for some reason Kerry said the same thing he'd said in the first presidential debate: "I made a mistake about how I <em>talk</em> about [the war], the president made a mistake in invading Iraq. Which is worse?" Yeah, ok, we know. Bad president. Now, TELL US ABOUT THE VOTE!
</p>

<p>
The simple explanation is that there were two versions of the bill to fund the ongoing efforts in Iraq. The first was actually supported by Senate Republicans&#8212;and Kerry&#8212;who were uncomfortable with the administration's version of the bill, which asked for $20 billion for reconstruction. As Glenn Kessler and Dan Morgan wrote in their Washington Post article <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57627-2004Sep2.html">GOP Prism Distorts Some Kerry Positions</a>,
</p>

<blockquote>
In a floor statement explaining his vote, Kerry said he favored the $67 billion for the troops on the ground -- "I support our troops in Iraq and their mission" -- but faulted the administration's $20 billion request for reconstruction. He complained that administration "has only given us a set of goals and vague timetables, not a detailed plan." 
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, we know how much Kerry values a plan&#8212;and if the Bush camp wanted to make a joke out of Kerry's vote, they could certainly talk about Plans. And they'd have to, if Kerry would just say to the American people what he's already said on the floor of the Senate (and what his running mate said in the vice presidential debate). Something like this would be great: "I supported a different version of the bill, one that would have provided $67 billion for bullets and fuel and body armor while saving taxpayers the $20 billion the administration earmarked for unspecified 'reconstruction' costs&#8212;what amounted to a slush fund for Bush/Cheney cronies like Halliburton."

<p>
OK gang, I've finally gotten the commenting system to work properly. Yippee! I knew that MT-Blacklist 1.65 wasn't compatible with MT3.11, but somehow I didn't interpret that to mean "you must remove MT-Blacklist from your server." Duh.
</p>

<p>
So here's the deal: If you don't have a <a href="http://www.typekey.com" target="a8_win">TypeKey</a> identity, your comments will still require approval. You should see a message alluding to this when you post. If you *do* have a TypeKey identity, you'll still need to be approved <b>the first time you comment</b>. Once I've approved you as a commenter, your comments will post immediately, no approval necessary.
</p>

<p>
For obvious reasons, I highly encourage you to <a href="https://www.typekey.com/t/typekey/register?lang=en-us&v=&need_email=&_return=&" target="a8_win">get a TypeKey identity</a>. It's easy, it's free, and you only have to do it once&#8212;your identity will enable you to post on any weblog that uses TypeKey authentication, not just mine.

<p>
Last night Al and I watched the third and final presidential debate on split-screen with the Red Sox/Yankees game (the debate was on the TiVo, the game was live). It was a little disjointed this way, since Pedro and Manny and Johnny were often much more mesmerizing than either Bush or Kerry, but it was a perfect use of TiVo. TiVo is my favorite way to watch debates because you can go, "wait a minute, <em>what did he say????</em>" (We also used it to hilarious effect during the vice presidential debate to replay&#8212;over and over and over&#8212;the sound of John Edwards ripping a strip of paper off his notepad while Cheney was talking, until we couldn't breathe, we were laughing so hard. Don't ask me why we found it so funny; we just did.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, here are the (occasionally very rough) notes I took as I watched; I reserve the right to revise and extend my remarks over the next day or two, as I have time to think about what I heard (and how I feel about it). My overall impression: Bush wasn't much better than he was in the previous two debates, but Kerry was generally worse. If I had to say that somebody "won", I'd declare a tie.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Oh geez, now <em>Bush</em> has a plan&#8212;a comprehensive plan, no less. God help us.  </li>
<li>That stupid smile is almost worse than the smirk. <em>Wipe that smile off your face, boy.</em> </li>
<li>Bush, responding to a question about the shortage of flu vaccine: &quot;we relied upon a company out of England.&quot; Was that code for &quot;can't trust our allies!&quot;? Oh wait, we're working with Canada to get more vaccine! So now <a href="javascript:alert(canadaQuote);">pharmaceuticals from Canada are safe</a>? </li>
<li>I'm frustrated with Kerry for being so &quot;on message&quot; that he isn't responding to what Bush is saying.</li>
<li>Is Kerry sick? He sounds like he's losing his voice, and he looks gray and lifeless.</li>
<li>&quot;Plan... plan... plan...&quot; How many times did Kerry just say &quot;plan&quot;? (According to the transcript, four times in that one sentence: &quot;Every plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, 
my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly 
how I'm going to pay for those.&quot;)</li>
<li>It's impossible to even remember what the question was when Kerry really gets rolling.</li>
<li>Bush is throwing out ridiculous numbers about Kerry's votes in the Senate. I love the smile on Kerry's face that says, &quot;those numbers are so wrong, you stupid schmuck&#8212;you have no idea what you're talking about, do you?&quot; But wait, what the hell&#8212;where's the 30-second follow-up where Kerry actually gets to SAY that and not just smile it? Demand your 30 seconds, you idiot! </li>
<li> Did Bush just say, &quot;Whew! I just cain't keep up with this cowboy and all his plans!&quot;? Oh, no; I see from the transcript that he said, &quot;Whew! Let me start with the Pell Grants...&quot;</li>
<li>What is this bullshit about &quot;telling people how to live their lives?&quot; Can I just say that among the other lies that the Republicans tell Americans&#8212;including two I've already talked about on this site, that they're for smaller government and that they're the party of fiscal responsibility&#8212;this one ranks as perhaps the most egregious. They say all the time that the Democrats want government to run your lives, and Republicans don't... and yet they're the party that wants to legislate prayer in the schools, that wants to teach only abstinence and not offer sex education, that wants to tie doctors' hands by banning abortion and similar procedures, that wants to amend the Constitution to deny marriage to homosexuals... I could go on.</li>
<li>Bush just gave a fairly coherent response to a question about homosexuality, but I think he needs to stop talking about &quot;activist judges&quot; right the fuck NOW. Judges in this country are interpreting case law and the U.S. Constitution, not making new law. Amending the Constitution is making new law. </li>
<li>How come Bush gets 30 seconds rebuttal and Kerry doesn't? BECAUSE HE TAKES IT, and Kerry doesn't. Stop being so polite, Kerry!</li>
<li>&quot;That's why I fight against poverty.&nbsp;That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.
That's why I fight for equality and justice.&quot; I think Kerry just said he's Superman. </li>
<li>Bush: &quot;Heh heh heh heh, huh huh.&quot; Gads, I thought the smirk was creepy... the laugh is worse.</li>
<li>Did Bush just say &quot;we need to introduce technology to health care?&quot; Jesus, have you been to the doctor lately? (Oh right, you haven't&#8212;you postponed your yearly physical until after the election.) I sometimes wonder if health costs are going up *because* of increased use of technology. Are we undertaking procedures because we can, without asking whether we should? It seems a little cost-benefit analysis is in order. </li>
<li>If Bush is so keen on &quot;market forces&quot; applying to health care, why did he shackle them in his Medicare prescription drug plan? And for pete's sake, why didn't Kerry ask that? Big puck-in-front-of-the-net moment, Kerry, and you chose it to defend&#8212;FINALLY&#8212;your voting record. Keep up!</li>
<li>Bush: Just as incoherent as ever.<br>
Kerry: More wooden and unresponsive than usual.</li>
<li> Bush: &quot;We're increasing the border security of the United States.&nbsp;We've got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border.&quot; Why just on the southern border? Aren't you afraid of those Canadians streaming down from the north with their cheap prescription drugs?</li>
<li>Kerry, it's not enough to say, &quot;he hasn't done it right, and I will!&quot; You have to say HOW.</li>
<li>Aren't &quot; temporary worker cards&quot; just insourcing? Bush said that such cards would allow &quot;a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an 
American willing to do that job.&quot; I'm wondering if it's not the job that Americans would find repulsive, but the wage. What American can support himself, much less a family, on $5.15 an hour? As Bush himself pointed out, however, $5.15 sounds like a princely sum to someone currently making 50 cents an hour.</li>
<li>Bush, please don't flat-palm the podium like that. You look like a 1 year-old in a high chair.</li>
<li>Kerry's response to a question on faith and religion was pretty good&#8212;and I think he was right to connect &quot;loving they neighborh as you do yourself&quot; to school funding, which is very have and have not right now&#8212;but he also qualified quite a bit. He seems incapable of finishing a thought without pausing to qualify it every which way to Sunday.</li>
<li>Kerry: &quot;My friend John McCain....&quot; If you can't get McCain to endorse you, at least point out that you're better friends with him than he is with the guy he's supporting. (And notice how Bush made sure we remembered that &quot;John McCain is for ME for president.&quot;)</li>
<li>I'm so glad that Edwards was the Democratic talking head CBS got to analyze the debate. He's so good at getting the Kerry message across&#8212;better than Kerry is, actually. Funny that Rather described him as &quot;the bottom half of the Democratic ticket&quot;; it'd be more accurate to describe him as the clearer half.</li>
</ul>

Al was home sick for one full day and two partial days last week, and I either caught what he had, or I picked something up from the local Department of Recreation swimming pool. (Gotta remember to put alcohol in my ears before and after swimming!) Wherever I got it, it seems to be something in the standard cold family, so hopefully it's not too serious&#8212;and hopefully it'll clear up soon, so I can start begging for a flu shot. (I figure I'm a high priority, given that I'm pregnant and asthmatic, and that my asthma and allergy doctors will have been given a supply of vaccine.) 
</p>
<p>
I know I haven't turned the corner yet, illness-wise, given that I woke up feeling worse today than yesterday. I hope I'm not making things worse still by refusing to shower and spending the day in my jammies. (I tried the optimistic route yesterday, getting showered, made up, dressed, and out of the house, but I just ended up exhausted and miserable by the end of the day.)
</p>
<p>
I don't know whether my head and sinuses are aching in sympathy with the belly or vice versa, but the belly is definitely aching these days. It actually woke me up a couple times last night, and it was particularly painful trying to heave myself out of bed to pee. My belly button still hasn't popped out, and I've yet to discover any stretch marks, so I'm guessing that it still has a little growing to do&#8212;which seems inconceivable, given its already-enormous dimensions.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, everywhere I look there's news about the dangers of delivering prematurely. Not just in pregnancy magazines, either&#8212;TIME even has an article about it this week. With all the cramps and Braxton-Hicks contractions I've been having, not to mention the belly pains of last night, I'm now slightly paranoid about going into labor early. Never have I been so eager to rush through October, which is usually my favorite month on account of the crisper weather, the changing leaves, my birthday, and Halloween. I figure if we can just get to November, we'll be in the birthing ballpark; the baby will be more equipped to deal with the outside world, and with a couple weeks of childbirth education classes under our belts, we'll be more equipped to deal with the baby.

<h3 class="title">Let's Go Red Sox!</h3>

<p>
Every time the Red Sox make the playoffs, I get excited. Like every other Red Sox fan on the planet, I think, "this could be the year!" And then they go down&#8212;in a one-run heartbreaker, or in a 9-run blowout&#8212;and I start to wonder: is every other team in the league (especially the one that just missed the Wild Card) thinking, "Jesus, I can't believe we wasted a playoff spot on the Red Sox <em>again</em>." I also think of that time my friend Josie and I were watching the Broncos bungle yet <em>another</em> Super Bowl opportunity, back when we were in college in the 80s, and how Josie remarked, "THE BRONCOS DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL TO DO IN A SUPER BOWL."
</p>

<p>
And then I remember how the Broncos came back in the 90s to win back-to-back Super Bowls, and I keep the faith. There's always game 4, 5, 6, and 7. And failing that, there's next year. Go Sox!

<h3 class="title">The Flu: Who Knew?</h3>

<p>
I saw <a href="http://suburbanguerrilla.blogspot.com/2004/10/clusterfuckmore-incompetencewhy-did.html" target="a8_win">this interesting item</a> on <a href="http://suburbanguerrilla.blogspot.com" target="a8_win">Suburban Guerrilla</a> about the difference in the British and American responses to the Chiron debacle, but I wasn't sure how reliable the source was (especially given the dodgy editing, the lack of attribution, and the numerous server errors I got on my first visit to the site).
</p>

<p>
It seems the story's accurate, if the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18795-2004Oct8.html" target="a8_win">Washington Post</a> is to be believed. What's interesting to me is that this could be yet another example of the Bush administration and its agencies being overly optimistic in the face of bad news, of hearing what they want to hear rather than preparing for a worst-case scenario, as the British did. [I do wonder whether the CDC would have been <a href="http://www.getaflushot.com/cidrap.htm" target="a8_win">so optimistic</a> under any administration, or just this one; how much influence does the administration have over the CDC, anyway? I know it has some, based on what happened&#8212;or didn't happen&#8212;in the early days of the AIDS crisis...] 
</p>

<p>
On a related note, I saw an article in a local Lancaster County, PA paper about how many people are positively <em>panicking</em> about the vaccine shortage, harrassing local doctors and calling every medical-related agency and private firm in the area looking to get on a non-existent waiting list for a shot, and that several states are considering making it a crime to give a flu shot to a healthy, low-risk individual. Freaky. I feel kinda bad that I'm high-risk on two counts (asthma and pregnancy), and that I'll have to jump on the give-me-a-flu-shot-now bandwagon. :-/

<h3 class="title">A Second Term: The Second Coming?</h3>

<p>
Ron Suskind, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743255461/avocado8/ref%3Dnosim/" target="a8_win">The Price of Loyalty</a>, wrote a fascinating piece for yesterday's New York Times Magazine called "Without a Doubt" (link via <a href="http://www.acutor.be/silt/" target="a8_win">Silt</a>, via my well-read neighbor, <a href="http://rittenhouse.blogspot.com/" target="a8_win">Mr. Rittenhouse</a>). It's about the role of faith in the Bush White House&#8212;the kind of faith, as George Seaton (and Kris Kringle, in Miracle on 34th Street) put it, that is "believing in things when common sense tells you not to."
</p>

<p>
I don't know about you, but I'd prefer a president with faith *and* common sense. A guy who goes with his gut, but only after careful analysis. I've made several leaps of faith in my life&#8212;buying a house when the numbers didn't add up, because I felt like there was something around the bend that would make it all work out; agreeing to bear a child when I wasn't entirely sure I could endure childbirth, much less parenthood; moving to new cities where I didn't know a single person, without a job and with only a couple hundred dollars in my pocket&#8212;so I'm comfortable with a president who occasionally says, "I know this seems odd, but it feels right." 
</p>

<p>
However, it's difficult for me to get behind someone who says, "Look, I know I'm right, and I'm not going to justify it for you" about every decision he makes. Especially someone who clearly ignores&#8212;even derides&#8212;evidence, analysis, and debate. There's room for faith in the White House, for belief in a higher power, for prayer, for instincts, for going with your gut. But there must also be room&#8212;a whole floor would be nice&#8212;for discussion, deliberation, and examining opposing views. It's OK to admit that there are things that you don't know&#8212;that you cannot know&#8212;but you must also make an effort to learn what you can. As President, it's your responsibility to be informed.
</p>

<p>
Vaara selected <a href="http://www.acutor.be/silt/index.php?id=557" target="a8_win">a particularly shocking quote from the article</a> to highlight on his site, one in which a Bush aide accused Suskind of being part of "the reality-based community." Several other quotes from the article caught my attention, including this one:
</p>

<blockquote>
And for those who don't get it? That was explained to me in late 2002 by Mark McKinnon, a longtime senior media adviser to Bush, who now runs his own consulting firm and helps the president. He started by challenging me. &quot;You think he's an idiot, don't you?&quot; I said, no, I didn't. &quot;No, you do, all of you do, up and down the West Coast, the East Coast, a few blocks in southern Manhattan called Wall Street. Let me clue you in. We don't care. You see, you're outnumbered 2 to 1 by folks in the big, wide middle of America, busy working people who don't read The New York Times or Washington Post or The L.A. Times. And you know what they like? They like the way he walks and the way he points, the way he exudes confidence. They have faith in him. And when you attack him for his malaprops, his jumbled syntax, it's good for us. Because you know what those folks don't like? They don't like you!&quot; In this instance, the final &quot;you,&quot; of course, meant the entire reality-based community.
</blockquote>

<p>
It's a lengthy piece, but worth the time. Whether you consider yourself religious, spiritual, agnostic, or atheistic, please also consider that the word "faith," as used by the Bush administration, might not mean what you think it does&#8212;and that having the Messiah running your country might not be the best thing for the world.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Return of the Reviews</h3>

<p>
A while back I decided to revive my <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/books/">book reviews</a> by moving the existing reviews to a mySQL database and adding new ones. The database was on the fritz for a few months, which put a damper on reviewing books as I read them, but now that it's back up and working again, I've decided to link my "Additional Reading" titles to the reviews rather than to Amazon.com.
</p>

<p>
Here's how it will work: The heading, "Additional Reading", will always be linked to the main review page. The book I'm currently reading (and therefore haven't reviewed yet), will link to Amazon.com, so you can see what it's about. The remaining books in the list (usually the last five or so that I've read) will be linked to their individual reviews. Hope you find the reviews somewhat useful, and that they lead you to some worthwhile titles. If you think you can discern my taste from them, feel free to make recommendations by e-mailing me (given that I own this domain, and you know my name, you can probably guess my e-mail address :).

<h3 class="title">Ode to Annie</h3>

<p>
Yesterday afternoon I took our cat, Annie, to the vet. She's been coughing for about a week (like cats do when they're trying to eject a hairball, but no hairballs ever came out), and she started eating about half as much food as she normally does (very strange for Annie, who is not a self-regulator when it comes to food). I figured she might have bronchitis or even pneumonia, since she was acting like I do when I get pneumonia.
</p>
<p>
So the vet's office is only 8 blocks away, and it's tough to get a cab without walking at least halfway there, so I figured I'd just walk the whole way with the cat carrier. How hard could it be? As it turns out, much harder than I'd hoped&#8212;probably because I was lugging around extra pregnancy weight in addition to the 10-12 lbs. of cat and carrier. 
</p>
<p>
The most comfortable position to haul the carrier, for both of us, turned out to be held out in front of me, like a tray. The only problem with this position was that I couldn't see where I was going&#8212;a dangerous thing when you're pregnant. (I already fell off a curb on our last visit to San Francisco, and my vision wasn't even obstructed then.) I shifted the carrier from one side to the other so I could see, which wasn't quite as efficient weight-distribution-wise, but it was better than any other position I tried. 
</p>
<p>
I'd made it about four blocks when a businessman who looked like a thinner Dick Cheney passed me, smiled, and uttered what would have been the caption for the photo had he taken one just then: &quot;Precious cargo.&quot; It was obvious from his glance that he meant both the cat and the belly, and I smiled back at him. A few steps later I had to stop and rest. I was beginning to regret having stashed a library book in my backpack in case there was a long wait; the hardback, combined with my water bottle (never leave home without one when you're pregnant), were adding another few pounds to my load. I ended up having to stop for rest  three more times before I made it to the vet&#8212;good thing I'd left early. I resolved to take a cab home.
</p>
<p>
As I finished filling out the paperwork for a new patient at the vet's office, Annie popped her head out of the top of the carrier (which I'd unzipped a bit upon arrival, so she could see me if she wanted to) and began to cough&#8212;this time with her tongue hanging out, which I'd never seen before. &quot;Uh oh,&quot; I said. &quot;Uh oh.&quot; The receptionist was on the phone immediately, and I heard her say, &quot;Dr. Vine, your 4:20 is here, and she's not doing too well.&quot; Annie and I were ushered back into an exam room asap.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Vine was about my age, and really nice. She asked questions about Annie's symptoms, and she listened to all the answers intently. She then listened to Annie's heart and lungs (she said her heart sounds were muffled, possibly due to fluid around the heart) and felt her abdomen. &quot;I can feel something in her belly,&quot; she said. &quot;It might just be a poop, or a bit of undigested food, but it might also be a mass of some kind. Do you mind if I take some x-rays?&quot; I said no problem, I'd brought a book, so I could wait the 20 minutes it would take to develop the film.
</p>
<p>
 After reading for a bit, Dr. Vine came out to tell me she had Annie's x-rays ready. She showed me what she'd felt in Annie's belly&#8212;a huge mass that was squishing her intestines down (which explains why Annie's been crying when she poops lately&#8212;it wasn't hemorrhoids)&#8212;and said it could be related to any number of organs in the area, including the liver or pancreas. Then she pointed to the x-ray of Annie's lungs. &quot;All of this should be black,&quot; she said, outlining an area that was almost completely white, except for a small, oval-shaped space in the middle. 
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure when I realized that this was Very Bad and started to cry, but it was probably right after Dr. Vine started outlining my options. She got me a tissue, and then took one for herself. I think perhaps the fact that I'd been so calm up until that moment and then broke down got to her. The tumor was so massive, and the fact that it seemed to be spreading to her lungs, made surgery and chemo the pipe dream option (one that I probably wouldn't have considered anyway, since it would have made Annie's life miserable). That left two options: tap her lungs so that she could come home with us for a couple days, or euthanize her right then.
</p>
<p>
 I opted for the tap, since I was so shocked and saddened that I didn't think I could cope if I didn't have time to say goodbye. I know that she only has a couple days&#8212;a week at best&#8212;but in the last 24 hours I've had a chance to tell her how much she's meant to me, and that has meant all the world. Annie has been an amazing companion; Al and I were just saying the other day how she's &quot;so my cat,&quot; even though Al got her long before he met me. She follows me everywhere, seems sad when I'm not around, has gone from a don't-touch-me cat to one who actually *wants* to sit on my lap, and gives me someone to talk and sing to when I'm in the house all day alone.
And perhaps most importantly, Annie helped me prepare for parenthood. Before I met her, I was afraid of taking on a houseplant, much less a pet or a child. She showed me that along with  responsibilities come rewards. Thank you Annie, for everything.

[Incidentally, I didn't have to take a cab home. I called Al from the vet's office in tears, and he came to meet me right away. He carried Annie home tray-style, while I watched for potholes.]

<h3 class="title">Does That Mean Bush Invaded Iraq To Give WMD to Terrorists?</h3>

<p>
That was my husband's question when we started talking about <a href="http://www.comcast.net/News/GENERAL/XML/1107_AP_Online_Regional___Middle_East/670968d9-c5e7-4e38-b76b-76dee7ac17c7.html" target="a8_win">the shocking story of missing explosives in Iraq</a>, and wondering whether the Bush administration would characterize the explosives as evidence that Saddam was reviving his nuclear weapons program.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, the White House's <a href="http://www.comcast.net/News/GENERAL//XML/1131_Presidential/bf6d599c-1a1d-4539-a1a0-48e57ae16deb.html" target="a8_win">response</a> to the theft seemed to go in the other direction:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
White House spokesman Scott McClellan played down the threat posed by explosives missing from the Al Qaqaa military installation. He said there was no threat of nuclear proliferation, and preferred to concentrate on weapons destroyed, not those lost.
</p>

<p>
"We have destroyed more than 243,000 munitions," he said. "We've secured another nearly 163,000 that will be destroyed."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But not these ones, apparently. I was pleasantly surprised to hear the Kerry campaign (via Joe Lockhart) attack the Bush administration on this issue immediately and coherently:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"The Bush administration knew where this stockpile was, but took no action to secure the site. They were urgently and specifically informed that terrorists could be helping themselves to the most dangerous explosives bonanza in history, but nothing was done to prevent it from happening," he said.
</p>

<p>
"This material was monitored and controlled by U.N. inspectors before the invasion of Iraq. Thanks to the stunning incompetence of the Bush administration, we now have no idea where it is," Lockhart said. He demanded the White House explain "why they failed to safeguard these explosives and keep them out of the hands of our enemies."
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="title">We Take Halloween Very Seriously Around Here</h3>

<p>
[I'm obviously catching up on some pent-up blogging in between crying jags. This is my first day in the house alone without Annie, and I'm trying to cope with her absence by going about my normal routine and by sorting through cat photos for a post I'd planned to put together before I knew she was sick (look for that soon).]
</p>

<p>
I love Christmastime, and the cynical romantic in me (not to mention the chocolate lover) is fond of Valentine's Day, but my favorite holiday is Halloween. We were so bummed that we weren't able to move into our new house in Philadelphia in time for Halloween last year, as Al and I have turned decorating our yard and handing out candy into a much-anticipated geekfest.
</p>

<p>
We have several yard decorations that we collected in Mountain View, and it turns out that though we have no actual yard here in Philadelphia, our front <a href="/blog/images/halloween_decos.html" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('/blog/images/halloween_decos.html','decos','width=600,height=400');return false;">"garden"</a> is perfect for the <a href="/blog/images/tombstones.html" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('/blog/images/tombstones.html','decos','width=600,height=400');return false;">tombstones</a>. We (er, Al) put them up yesterday, and several people stopped their cars to comment. Today I've seen more folks, especially those with kids, walk by and point. So cool.
</p>

<p>
On Halloween night, we will alternately be handing out candy, blogging about the various costumes our trick-or-treaters are wearing, and tracking candy choices (Al's forte). Since Blogger, which I originally used to post our <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/halloween/2002.html">all hallows eve blog</a> doesn't work with my new server, in the next couple days I'll be establishing a new a.h.e. blog using Movable Type. Stay tuned for that.
</p>

<p>
If I can just finish my costume in time, I will be greeting the kids at the door dressed as Patrick Starfish. (Right now my costume makes me look like a pink Klansman, but hopefully once I get the eyes and eyebrows painted on the hood, and the mouth pinned up, I'll be recognizable as a dumb-as-dirt cartoon character instead of a dumb-as-dirt racist.) Al will wear the <a href="/blog/images/spongebob_jersey.html" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('/blog/images/spongebob_jersey.html','halloween','width=400,height=300');return false;">yellow jersey I created for my SpongeBob costume</a> back in 2000, which will allow him to concentrate his efforts on his candy charts and graphs rather than on costume design, while still dressing up (not to mention staying with the theme).
</p>

<h3 class="title">In the Eyes of the Beholder</h3>

<p>
Yesterday Bill Clinton, and later John Kerry himself, were here campaigning for the Kerry/Edwards ticket. There was a big rally in and around Love Plaza, which I usually walk through to get to Al's office; yesterday I was turned away by the crowds at 17th Street, about a block and a half away. It was good to see so many supporters of the Democratic ticket earnestly doing their parts to cheer on the nominee and the former President.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the crowds of supporters, there were also zillions of policemen. I want to like the police in Philadelphia, I really do&#8212;but my few experiences with them so far have left a bad taste in my mouth. The main tone-setter was the incident that happened about a month after we moved out here: In attempting to cross Broad Street, a large, divided avenue where that day traffic was being directed by two cops, the first cop signalled us to cross after we'd waited more than five minutes with no walk signal in sight. We made it to the median (about 8 of us, plus at least one baby in a stroller), where the other cop pointedly ignored us until I finally said, in what I thought was a jovial tone, "little help here?"
</p>

<p>
The cop pointed to the "don't walk" signal without looking at us and said, "that's what you get for crossing against the light." Several of us spoke up at once, "But the other cop told us to go!" This cop then shouted at us, "No he didn't!", which was (a) merely an assumption on his part, and (b) patently false. He then muttered something about stupid tourists, and Al said, "what did you say?" He replied, "I said go back where you came from, asshole!" Yep, that's our friendly Philadelphia cop for you. Way to make us feel welcome, buddy!
</p>

<p>
So anyway, back to yesterday. There were policemen everywhere (and Secret Service, I'm sure, though I didn't spot any): some directing traffic and pedestrians with a slight overuse of the whistle, some sitting in their cars with the engines running, and some milling about in small groups, chatting. Al passed one of these groups as he walked in to work, and he overheard a snippet of their conversation:
</p>

<p>
"Who you voting for?"<br />
"Me? Bush."<br />
"Bush."<br />
"Bush."<br />
"Yeah, I'm a Bush guy."<br />
&lt;pause&gt;<br />
"Yeah, you can see it in his eyes."
</p>

<p>
When Al related this conversation, I was like, "see <em>what</em> in his eyes, exactly?" The vacuous gaze of a Texas steer? The look that says, "I'm in over my head"? A resolve to stick to his guns against all reason? "Leadership, apparently," said Al. "They said something about the fact that he was a leader." OK, for the sake of argument, he's a leader. But hello, do you like where he's leading you?
</p>

<p>
Al remarked that he'd so wanted to stop and say, "did you know that Kerry has the endorsement of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers? That he voted to put 100,000 more cops on the street and supported the ban on assault weapons? That he has the support of the Boston Police for refusing to cross their picket line in Boston?", but he didn't. No sense provoking another "asshole" remark from a bunch of guys who, like our current President, obviously value gut feeling (or a vapid stare) over logic and truth.
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Promised Pictorial</h3>

<p>
I mentioned that there would be an upcoming post with Annie photos; this is it. A couple weeks before she died, I had the idea to create a catalog of Annie's various poses and positions and our names for them. It was something I figured I'd work on eventually; I didn't realize then that I wouldn't have time to take pictures of any as-yet-unphotographed poses.
</p>

<p>
In going through all our Annie photos to work through our grief and create a screensaver for the Mac laptop, I found examples of many of the common poses, as well as several moments that were just plain sweet. <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/annie/annie.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/annie/annie.html','annie','scrollbars=yes,width=500,height=670');return false;">I've compiled them here</a>.

<h3 class="title">What Would Osama bin Laden Do?</h3>

<p>
Among the comments on blurbomat's <a href="http://www.blurbomat.com/archives/2004/10/24/endorsement.html" target="a8_win">endorsement post</a> from a few days ago was this one from a woman named Melissa:
</p>

<blockquote>
I support Bush for national security...like it or not under the Democrat presidency of Clinton, military/intelligence spending was cut so drastically that this country could not defend itself. Historically the Democrats are not big on a strong military presence. Ask yourself who Al Queda, Saddam, Ossama would vote for...KERRY...so I have to vote against them.
</blockquote>

<p>
According to a blurb on the front page of the <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/dailynews/" target="a8_win">Philadelphia Daily News</a> web site right now, Melissa appears to be slightly off the mark:
</p>

<blockquote>
Today's Washington Times reports that in Iraq, "foreign extremists prefer Bush, because he's a provocative figure, and the more they can push people to the extreme, the better for their case." Hmmmmm. Who are those foreign extremists in Iraq? Will Bunch says it's al Qaeda, and challenges you to come up with a differing valid interpretation of that quote.
</blockquote>

<p>
You can find Will Bunch's analysis of the <cite>Washington Times</cite> article in its entirety at <a href="http://www.pnionline.com/dnblog/extra/archives/001136.html" target="a8_win">Campaign Extra</a>.

<h3 class="title">October Pregnancy Update</h3>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/nothappy_102804.jpg" alt="Me in my 8th month" width="322" height="567" class="inline-left" galleryimg="no"> It's funny how a bad coffee can ruin your morning. Actually, I think the problem was that I didn't get coffee at all&#8212;I suspect what the barista at the Starbucks in the Wynnewood Genuardi's gave me was a hot chocolate (instead of the decaf grande nonfat 2-pump mocha with whip that I asked for, or the decaf 2-shot mocha that he wrote on the cup). In any case, it was so sweet it made my teeth hurt, and I couldn't drink more than a couple sips. I should have let him &quot;try again&quot; when he offered; I just couldn't imagine it would come out any better the second time, given that he swore up and down that he'd only put two squirts of chocolate syrup in the first time, and the fact that he was literally shaking with nerves as he flipped through the drink recipe book after each order.
</p>
<p>
My reason for mentioning this is that it accounts for the look on my face in the photo at left. That, and the fact that I had to get up at 7:15am to take our car in for its yearly inspection after only five hours of fitful sleep; that I forgot my cell phone and was berated for it by the guy at the service station (Me: &quot;yes, it would have been nice if I'd remembered to put my phone in my purse, but I didn't, and there's nothing I can do about it now.&quot;); that I carefully avoided the pet supply aisle in the Genuardi's only to cry anyway when I passed the baby food (which Annie loved, and which we fed her before she died to make her happy); that I got snapped at again when I went to pay for the inspection for not handing in my $20 off coupon <em>when I dropped the car off</em>; and that I was honked at and flipped off and forced to run a red light during the course of the 40-minute round trip to Wynnewood by a bunch of crazy morning commuters who obviously also got super-sweet hot chocolate instead of the coffee they'd wanted.
</p>
<p>
ANYWAY...here's the pregnancy scoop at the end of October: 
</p>
<p>
<b>I can't find anything to eat. </b>It's shocking, I know, but I'm tired of eating cookies and cake and Luna bars and other random snacks. I don't even want BK Veggies from Burger King (which I was craving constantly earlier this month), bean burritos from Taco Bell, sandwiches from Subway, or Vegan Pad Thai bowls from Trader Joe's. I want real food, and I can't seem to find any in the house (or find the energy to make anything myself). All the TV dinners in the freezer seem to have meat in them (I guess we exhausted all the vegetarian entrees), but I'm not sure a Lean Cuisine or Smart Ones pasta dish would do the trick for me anyway. Thank god for the prepared foods and soup bar at Whole Foods, or I would have keeled over from hunger yesterday.
</p>
<p>
<b>I don't run errands anymore, I shuffle them</b>. I'm good for about one regular-paced activity per day (a walk to meet Al for lunch, for example, or three or four trips up and down the stairs in the house), and then I slow to a crawl. For two days in a row, I've walked an extra six or seven blocks (one way) to do just one more errand&#8212;rather than  giving in to the exhaustion and going home&#8212;because going home would mean starting the journey from scratch the next day. Al finds this &quot;starting from scratch&quot; concept somewhat hilarious. (To me it's just the principle of sunk costs in action.) He's also finding that he has to slow down to match my pace now; he used to be the one who was always asking <em>me</em> to slow down. 
</p>
<p>
<b>I haven't been able to get a flu shot. </b>Philadelphia apparently exhausted its supply a couple weeks ago; I guess I should have called my allergist as soon as I heard of the shortage. I'm not sure whether it's worth it to drive the two hours and fifteen minutes to Annapolis, MD (and back, of course) on Saturday morning to get one at the clinic being offered at Annapolis High School. [Update: I called about the Annapolis clinic, and it's limited to Anne Arundel County, Maryland residents. I'm out of luck again.]
</p>
<p>
<b>The heartburn has gone nuclear. </b>I'm a little reluctant to take another course of Prilosec just now, given that the relief only lasts while I'm taking it, and the recent reports that heartburn medications of this type lessen your resistence to pneumonia (especially worrisome since I haven't gotten a flu shot). Luckily, I finally discovered Smooth Dissolve TUMS, which are a zillion times better than TUMS Ultra or TUMS EX. They taste like Willy Wonka fruit tablets, and they don't make me nauseous as the other varieties do. (Good thing, because I often find myself chewing 8-10 of them in a five minute period in the middle of the night.) 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Bellybutton Watch has finally begun; we expect it to pop out any time now. </b>Although there's still a definite indentation at the site of my umbilicus, we've noticed that the skin around the belly button has become taught and smooth. We suspect that this is skin that used to be inside the indentation but that is now stretched out around it. 
</p>
<p>
<b>This belly is HEAVY. </b>In my first trimester (and some weeks into my second), I would often go to bed at night with what looked to me like a prominent belly, only to wake up to a relatively flat stomach again. My mom thought this was totally weird; I figured it was just gravity (specifically, my stomach muscles not being able to keep up with gravity) and the constant eating that was required to keep the nausea at bay that caused my stomach to pook out at the end of the day. Well, the phenomenon is happening again. While my belly is never flat anymore, it's definitely bigger at the end of the day than it is in the morning. I think most of this increase can be attributed to the baby attempting to push his bum out my belly button (that's certainly what it feels like he's doing&#8212;pushing outward with all his might), and again, to eating. Either way, the further the belly sticks out, the harder it is to carry around.
</p>
<p>
<b>I'm sick of buying maternity clothes.</b> I had this idea that the clothes I bought in August would last me until I delivered&#8212;and they probably would have, if the weather hadn't changed. I totally forgot that it would get colder starting in October, and that I'd need more than the one sweater I bought back in spring at a Lord &amp; Taylor men's department sale. I finally caved and bought three maternity turtleneck sweaters (I figure I'll be able to wear them for a couple months after the birth, too), but after that I put my foot down and stocked up only on Old Navy Perfect-Fit T-shirts in size XL (I'm wearing a brown one in the photo above). The saleswoman at Old Navy seemed to think XXL was necessary, but I'm convinced that XL is sufficient (and likely to be wearable post-pregnancy, provided the belly hasn't permanently stretched out the middles).
</p>
<p>
<b>I don't find the relaxation exercises at the childbirth class very relaxing. </b>We've only had one childbirth class (we have the earliest due date of anyone in there, fwiw), but so far I'm finding the part where we get down on the floor and try out different &quot;relaxing&quot; positions extremely annoying. I'm actually able to relax pretty easily by my own methods, and I've already tried out several positions that I think would be useful for laboring; however, practicing them (and others) in class is so irritating that I'm afraid that it will ruin whatever solace I might otherwise have gained from them. I think next week I might have to leave the room when we get to that part, just so I can retain my inner calm. 
</p>
<p>
<b>I'm still not nervous. </b>Aside from the annoyance at being forced to relax, I still don't feel any real anxiety about the impending birth. I have two (competing) theories about why this might be. Theory A is that I've become so accustomed to being pregnant that I think of this as the New State of Things. In other words, my mind is convinced that I'll be pregnant forever. Theory B is that I've accepted that labor and birth are inevitable, so why worry? I've been dealing with the pain of heartburn and hemorrhoids EVERY DAY for quite a while now, and the birth will only be one day of pain. (Granted, it's likely to be far more intense, but I think for one day I can probably take it.) 
</p>

<p>
I think that about sums up the current state of things; now I need a nap.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Where's My Voter Information Guide?</h3>

<p>
When we lived in California, we got an official Voter Guide for every election&#8212;one that listed every candidate and every proposition on the ballot, including arguments for and against each. It also listed our polling place on the back, and usually included an application for an absentee ballot (handy if you knew you'd be travelling on election day). I've been waiting patiently for such a book to show up at my house in Philly, but so far, none has come.
</p>

<p>
The other day I happened to catch my friend Valerie, who moved from San Francisco back to Maine a few months ago, online. When I IMed to see what she was up to, she replied that she was taking a break from her violin practice "to see if I can find any info on our local bond measures so I can send in my ballot. Unlike SF, we're not inundated with info [here])." To which I replied, "Yeah, same here -- I'm like, 'where's my voter information guide?'" Valerie: "Exactly!"
</p>

<p>
I decided to try Valerie's technique and search the web for information. I found all kinds about how to register to vote, how to actually vote, how to determine whether I qualify for a provisional ballot, and what constitutes proper voter identification, but NOTHING ABOUT WHO THE CANDIDATES ARE. (Nothing at all about initiatives, either. Are there no ballot initiatives in Pennsylvania? Have my expectations been colored by living in proposition-happy California?)
</p>

<p>
When my searches of official websites failed, I tried the sites of local free weeklies. (In San Francisco, the <a href="http://www.sfbayguardian.com/" target="a8_win">SF Bay Guardian</a>, a liberal free weekly, published a <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/election/index.html" target="a8_win">voter guide</a> that was really useful; I remember voting a "straight Guardian ticket" one year, except for one proposition that I didn't agree with them on.) I even picked up an actual paper copy of Philadelphia Weekly yesterday, but alas, no voter guide. WTF? (I did find a couple of endorsements on the Philadelphia Weekly website, but they hardly constituted a guide.) 
</p>

<p>
Today we received in the mail our voter information <em>cards</em>&#8212;which informed us of our polling place (I'd already panicked when one of the official local election websites said I'd need to check the newspaper (!) to find out where to vote, and subsequently followed a link from the <a href="http://rittenhouse.blogspot.com/" target="a8_win">Rittenhouse Review</a> to <a href="http://www.hallwatch.org/elections/wardbook/pollingplace/index_html" target="a8_win">Hallwatch.org</a>, which gave me the scoop), our ward and division numbers, and the fact that we'd have to show ID because this is the first time we're voting in this district. It struck me as a little late to be telling us this stuff, but maybe the Voter Registration Office wanted to make sure we got it close enough to the election that we wouldn't misplace the info.
</p>

<p>
Along with Al's and my voter information cards, we also received one for the male half of the couple who used to live here; I guess he never re-registered when he moved (or maybe they finally moved out of state, as they intended to eventually, and word has not made it back to PA). In between the voter information cards were two slightly larger, four-color cards, one of which showed a photo of Yasser Arafat with the caption "Role Model and Statesman? John Kerry Thinks So." The other showed a nice Jewish lady by the name of Janet Kreisman, who, we are told, is a Registered Democrat, with the following quote: "I FEEL SAFE WITH PRESIDENT BUSH."
</p>

<p>
Once again I was left to puzzle, WTF? Why are we getting scare mail...? And then I saw the addressee. *We* are not getting scare mail; the former occupant, who happens to have a Jewish surname, is. I was pretty shocked, and yet glad for once that the former occupant's forwarding order had expired, while his voter registration had not&#8212;it gave me an opportunity to see some shady scare tactics that otherwise would have escaped my notice.
</p>

<p>
Here's my question (and at this point, I've obviously strayed pretty far from my original rant about the lack of voter information here in Philly, though I'll return to that in a moment): Does Bush-Cheney '04, Inc., which authorized the Arafat mailing, or the RNC, which paid for it, really think all American Jews vote based on a single issue&#8212;namely, Israel? I find that kind of hard to believe, but not being Jewish, I can't say for sure.
</p>

<p>
The other mailing, paid for by the Republican Jewish Coalition, focuses more broadly on the war on terror and 9/11 (though it also mentions "President Bush's unprecedented pro-Israel policies"). Ms. Kreisman goes on to say in the mailing that "I've always been a pro-choice Democrat, but party loyalties have no meaning when it comes to my family's safety." (I thought it was kind of interesting that the mailing would make reference to that other famous "single issue": abortion.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, seeing Ms. Kreisman's smiling face over the Republican Jewish Coalition's pitch made me think of one more place to try for voter information: <a href="http://www.lwv.org/" target="a8_win">The League of Women Voters</a>. Yay, women voters! While this non-partisan organization of course provides no endorsements, they do at least tell you <a href="http://www.congress.org/congressorg/e4/" target="a8_win">who (and what) is on the ballot</a> in your area. (Just enter your zip code into the box under My Races.) 
</p>

<p>
It was so cool to at least see who was running in my district; now I can Google their names, look up their records, and check for endorsements by various news organizations. I didn't see any ballot initiatives listed, so to test whether (a) the LWV doesn't give info on ballot initiatives, or (b) there just aren't any here, I entered my old address in San Francisco to see what would come up. Sure enough, there was a huge list of initiatives for SF, so I now know that the answer is (b), there just aren't any here.
</p>

<p>
Now, go vote! (On Tuesday of course. Wait until Tuesday!)
</p>

<h3 class="title">The When of the Weapons</h3>

<p>
There's an article in the New York Times today (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/politics/29bomb.html?pagewanted=1&th" target="a8_win">Video Shows G.I.'s at Weapon Cache</a>, free subscription required to view) describing a video shot by a Minneapolis-based TV news crew that purports to show intact IAEA seals at the Al Qaqaa munitions complex, as well as the now-missing crates of HMX explosives. When was the video shot? <strong>Nine days after the fall of Baghdad.</strong>
</p>

<p>
I was a bit frustrated by the article; in an apparent attempt to be balanced, they gave full airing to all the doubts the Bush Administration, the Pentagon, and others have been voicing about when (or even if) the explosives were looted. It's easy to finish the article unsure of when exactly the explosives disappeared, so let me clarify for you: <strong>They disappeared on or after April 18, 2003</strong>, which is when the video was shot.
</p>

<p>
My favorite "what the hell were they thinking?" moment:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The team opened storage containers, some of which contained white powder that independent experts said was consistent with HMX.
</p>

<p>
"The soldiers were pretty much in awe of what they were seeing," Mr. Caffrey [the team photographer] recalled. "They were saying their E.O.D. - Explosive Ordinance Division, people who blow this kind of stuff up - would have a field day."
</p>

<p>
The journalists filmed roughly 25 minutes of video. Mr. Caffrey added that the team left the bunker doors open. "It would have been easy for anybody to get in," he said.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="title">Bathroom Review: Ritz Carlton Philadelphia</h3>

<p>
Last night Al took me to the Rotunda in the Ritz Carlton Philadelphia to partake of its Friday and Saturday night Chocolate Dessert Buffet (a fabulous birthday present, I must say; if you go, be sure to try the bread pudding with the chocolate sauce). Of course, having walked there while 8 months pregnant and having drunk (decaf) coffee white snarfing down yummy desserts, it wasn't long before I had to pee.
</p>

<p>
I made my way to the bathrooms just off the Rotunda (behind the elevators on the City Hall side of the building), passed the one marked Gentlemen, and continued down the hall to the one marked Women, which was next to The Vault. Nobody else was in there at the time, so I picked the first stall and entered. (There was plenty of room between the toilet and the stall door, so no need to move to the handicap stall&#8212;something I've had to do lately in many bathrooms because there's either not enough room to (a) shut the stall door without banging the belly, or (b) lean forward far enough to heave myself off the toilet seat.)
</p>

<p>
The first thing I noticed in the stall was that the wallpaper on my right was peeling; the second thing I noticed was that there were no toilet seat covers. The toilet paper was of a decent commercial grade, however, so I made do with that. As I sat down to pee, I heard someone else enter the bathroom; while I completed my quiet tinkle, she poured forth like Niagra Falls. Since the Rotunda also houses a bar, in which many elegantly-dressed Philadelphians were downing Cosmopolitans and martinis, I figured that my neighbor had just had a lot to drink and had held her water a bit too long.
</p>

<p>
I manged to get up off the seat with little trouble (again, nice spacing between the seat and the stall door) and went to wash my hands. I honestly don't remember what the soap or the faucets were like, because as I looked up in the mirror, I saw the back of a man standing in the handicap stall (the door was wide open). I panicked for a second, thinking, "Jesus, did I go into the wrong bathroom?" No, I'd definitely passed the sign marked 'Gentlemen,' so this had to be the women's bathroom. He must be in the wrong spot.
</p>

<p>
I quickly reached for a (very nice) rolled washcloth with which to dry my hands; I was hoping to get out of there before he emerged, so he wouldn't be embarrassed. Too late&#8212;he started out of the stall, saw me, and immediately popped back inside, drawing the stall door partly closed. I was seeing all this out of the corner of my eye, so I don't think he saw me see him. I stifled a giggle as the door to the bathroom opened, and one of the waitresses from the bar walked in.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, she walked straight to the handicap stall and entered... only to gasp, "oh my! I'm sorry!" when she bumped into the poor guy inside. He was like, "oh no! I'm in the wrong one!" which of course he already knew because he'd seen me. She turned around and headed for another stall, looked at me, started shaking with laughter as I smiled and as the guy, cover hopelessly blown now, emerged from the handicap cubicle.
</p>

<p>
He continued to express his apologies and bewilderment, and exhorted both of us not to tell anybody as he walked out with me; I said no worries, I wouldn't. So OK, call me a promise-breaker, a flip-flopper, whatever&#8212;this was just too funny to keep to myself. And I haven't identified the poor man in any way, so hopefully even if he or his friends or family see this, only he will know I'm talking about him. Anyway, I pointed out the men's room to him, and he slipped in there to wash his hands, while I practically ran back to the Rotunda, laughing all the way, to tell Al.
</p>

<b><a href="http://www.ritzcarlton.com/hotels/philadelphia/" target="a8_win">Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia</a></b><br />
<b>Location: </b>10 Avenue of the Arts (Broad Street)<br />
<b>Shortest route to restroom: </b>Enter from the Market Street/City Hall side, through the doorway under the maroon awning. Restrooms are on your right, in the hallway that leads to The Valult (the cigar bar). Please note that the Women's room is the one directly adjacent to The Vault; the Gentlemen's room is at the Rotunda end of the hall.<br />
<b>Ease of access: </b>Very good.<br />
<b>Quality of facilities: </b>Good. The bathroom is clean and elegant if a bit shabby, with washcloths to dry your hands instead of paper towels or blowers. I didn't see any toilet seat covers, but the commercial-grade toilet paper is of sufficient thickness to line the seat.
