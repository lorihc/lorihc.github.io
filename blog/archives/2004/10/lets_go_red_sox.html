<h3 class="title">Let's Go Red Sox!</h3>

<p>
Every time the Red Sox make the playoffs, I get excited. Like every other Red Sox fan on the planet, I think, "this could be the year!" And then they go down&#8212;in a one-run heartbreaker, or in a 9-run blowout&#8212;and I start to wonder: is every other team in the league (especially the one that just missed the Wild Card) thinking, "Jesus, I can't believe we wasted a playoff spot on the Red Sox <em>again</em>." I also think of that time my friend Josie and I were watching the Broncos bungle yet <em>another</em> Super Bowl opportunity, back when we were in college in the 80s, and how Josie remarked, "THE BRONCOS DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL TO DO IN A SUPER BOWL."
</p>

<p>
And then I remember how the Broncos came back in the 90s to win back-to-back Super Bowls, and I keep the faith. There's always game 4, 5, 6, and 7. And failing that, there's next year. Go Sox!
