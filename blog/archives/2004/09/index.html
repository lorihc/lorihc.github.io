<h3 class="title">More Convention Coverage</h3>

<p>
I put the computer away while Laura Bush was speaking last night, mainly because I needed time to absorb what she was saying before I could comment on it. After the Beavis and Butthead-like performance of the Bush twins (huh huh, heh heh heh), Laura Bush's speech was compassionate, coherent, reasonably upbeat, and surprisingly smirk-free. It's really too bad she's married to such a schmuck.
</p>

<p>
This morning's Washington Post has a column by Tom Shales (I actually just looked to see who wrote it, and had an "aha!" moment&#8212;I used to enjoy his commentaries when I lived in D.C.) worth reading called <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51308-2004Sep1.html" target="a8_win">Man of Steel Flies into Washington</a>. It's mainly about Arnold Schwartzenegger's speech, but it also includes some analysis of the Republicans' use of TV/technology, as well as this hilarious quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
At the Fox network, the Republican convention is being covered like a happy birthday party for God, with the channel's right-leaning commentators and anchors hanging on for the joyride of their lives, all but turning cartwheels. 
</blockquote>

<p>
We were watching CNN, since neither of us can abide Fox News, but when the TiVo changed channels on us (to Bravo, for the West Wing) at 11pm, I couldn't convince Al to change back to the convention. "There's only so much I can take," he said. He seemed to find it more unnerving and demoralizing than me reading aloud from the 9/11 Commission report.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Looking for Support</h3>

<p>
I'm going to turn away from politics for the moment and return to pregnancy. It turns out I have more semi-regular readers of this site than I realized, and many of you have been super helpful in recommending maternity wear options from bras to evening wear. I need your help again, especially if you are tall.
</p>

<p>
As you probably know, varicose veins are one of the sorry side effects of pregnancy, and I've got a couple painful blue bulges just above the knee on my right leg. The midwife at my obstetrician's office said that support hose would help, "but who wants to wear support hose in the summer?" Instead, she suggested wrapping an ACE bandage around the sore spot at night.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this hasn't been very effective. Support hose really do seem to help, especially if I'll be standing all day. Here's the problem: I'm tall (a little over 5'9"), which means I'm already at the top end of most of the pantyhose sizing charts even when I'm at my normal weight. Trying to find support hose that fit has been a total nightmare. First of all, most of the hose in drug and department stores are of the "ultra sheer" or "regular sheer" variety (i.e., non-support, or, at best, "light support"). I've tried L'Eggs Active Support in size Q, but I had to cut the waistband to be able to breathe, and even then they're not very comfortable.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday afternoon I went to Strawbridge's (a department store here) and discovered that Hanes made a full support line called "Alive"... which only went up to 5'9" and 155 lbs. (my pre-pregnancy weight). I asked for help from the saleswoman ("do you have any support hose in plus sizes?") and was led to a single row of light support options from Hanes. The only option in my size was a pair with control top, but I bought them anyway. I was shocked to find that they just barely fit&#8212;despite the fact that I had 35 lbs. of leeway until the next size.
</p>

<p>
I checked online at drugstore.com to see if they carried any support hose. They do; namely, the Futuro line. It sounded wonderful: Full support, yadda yadda yadda. $28 seemed pretty steep for one pair, but if that was my only option...well, I guess I could swallow it. Unfortunately, it turned out to be not an option at all. Size XL (the biggest drugstore.com carries) doesn't even begin to cover the weight I'm at now.
</p>

<p>
When we went out for our walk last night, Al &amp; I stopped at Rite Aid, and I again perused the hosiery options. I settled on a pair of L'Eggs Body Shapers capri pants in size XL (which, again, left more than 30 lbs. of leeway within the size range). I wore them today, and if I wasn't jaded about the weight ranges on hosiery packaging before, I am now. I could swear that these things were really a size S that had been mislabeled. Once I got them on (after a mighty struggle), I'm happy to report that the firm fabric was a total godsend for my veins. I never could have stayed standing as long as I did without them. The "tummy shaper" top was less kind to the belly, however, and it made sitting down nearly impossible. I also ended up waiting as long as possible to pee, because I knew that I'd have to get the damn things down&#8212;and worse, back up again.
</p>

<p>
So here's my question: Does anyone know of a support hose solution for tall, pregnant women? If you have any firsthand knowledge of the following brands, discovered during a Google search, I'd be interested in that as well:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.supportplus.com/product_detail.cfm?STYLE=JB1514" target="a8_win">Jobst Maternity Moderate Support Pantyhose</a> ~ These seem incredibly expensive, and the sizing chart is the weirdest I've ever seen. I'm an XL at the thigh and hip (low end of the ranges), and an S at the ankle. I found a cheaper price for the mild support version of these hose on Amazon.com, but those have a different sizing chart&#8212;which I'm also having trouble figuring out&#8212;and it would mean ordering from Healthy Legs, a company that spams me regularly. No thanks.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.nurturecenter.com/matcomsuphos.html" target="a8_win">Gabrialla compression support hose</a> ~ According to the size chart I'm currently a Q, but as I've learned, if you're within 30 lbs. of a size border, you should get the next larger size. These don't seem to come in Q+.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.supportsockshop.com/acb_sss/showprod.cfm?&DID=10&CATID=1&ObjectGroup_ID=68" target="a8_win">Mediven Elegance</a> ~ I think I'm a Medium in these, but since this sizing chart is so at odds with every other, I'm skeptical. Also quite pricey.</li>
<li><a href="http://healthylegs.com/demapamoco.html" target="a8_win">Delilah Maternity Pantyhose Moderate Compression</a> ~ The sizing chart is pretty clear here, thank god, but again, it would mean ordering from Healthy Legs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Dirty Rotten Belly</h3>

<p>
First, let me say I am eating a <a href="http://www.amys.com/products/category_view.php?category=12" target="a8_win">NEW! Amy's Brown Rice Black-Eyed Peas &amp; Veggies Bowl</a>, and it is SO YUMMY. Hooray! I actually think it's helping my nausea, which returned this morning (it's been showing up now and again over the past couple weeks, usually if I overdo it the day before&#8212;and the definition of "overdoing it" is getting narrower and narrower, such that several trips up and down the three flights of stairs in our house now seem to qualify).
</p>

<p>
I am finding that as I near the third trimester, I'm much more focused on the baby than the belly&#8212;that is, the pregnancy is less interesting in and of itself. It's become a means to an end: namely, producing a new little addition to our family. I know that this is where many women start, but it's taken a while for me to get here. I think seeing the baby clothes (we now have two! outfits) helped.
</p>

<p>
This is not to say that the belly is not still very much in my thoughts, however. I may not be as fascinated by it anymore, but I *am* occasionally irritated by it. For one thing, I can't seem to keep it clean. I keep smearing, dripping, and dropping things on it. There seems to be an ever-present smattering of crumbs under my breasts, and often I'll walk around with a grease or dirt stain at or below belly-button level without realizing it. The other day I stopped to pet a dog, and he attempted to suck the baby out through my belly button with the Hoover-like action of his sweaty, dirt-covered nose. I had no choice but to spend the next two hours out in public with a large streak of mud across my mid-section, as it hadn't occurred to me to leave the house with an extra shirt in my purse.
</p>

<p>
Another irritation I have with the belly is that it is ALWAYS IN THE WAY. This is especially true when I make clumsy attempts to seduce my husband. Last night I finally broke down and cried for about an hour because I feel so dorky and dumb in this department. I don't want to go into further details, but suffice it to say that if I could just remove the belly from time to time like an undergarment, I'd feel a lot closer (heck, I'd *be* a lot closer) to my husband, physically speaking. (Emotionally, we're doing great, thanks&#8212;despite my superdork self-image, he thinks I look great, and the love he feels for me is so palpable it brings tears to my eyes.)
</p>

<p>
The other problem I have with the belly is that it weighs a lot. It's getting increasingly difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position because of its bulk; I actually had to get up at 6:30 this morning because my hips and belly ached so badly that I couldn't even stay in bed any longer, much less sleep. (Thank god for the super-comfy leather chair Al bought me last week; I was able to go sit in that for an hour and read until Al got up. I'm sure I'll be sleeping in it before long, and I hope to be nursing in it come December.)
</p>

<p>
And of course, just when I'm losing interest in the belly or attempting to ignore the nuisance it presents, everyone else is finally acknowledging it. I get asked my due date all the time now, and today at Whole Foods a woman asked me if it was me or the baby who was considering buying the aged Gouda. (At first I didn't understand the question, and just stared at her blankly. I keep forgetting that people now know that I'm pregnant without me telling them.) I'm still not getting smiles from other pregnant women, but I'm getting them from everyone else&#8212;and new moms in particular have been very friendly. At least the belly is getting a little affection from the outside world; I guess it helps to balance the resentment it sometimes gets from me.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Look Away, Look Away!</h3>

<p>
I upgraded the blogs at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/">lori-and-al.com</a> to Movable Type 3.0D weeks ago (though I've yet to rebuild the completely hosed <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town_II/">about_town</a> databases, which accounts for why I haven't added to them in forever), but I've been procrastinating when it comes to upgrading over here at avocado8. Well, today's the day I take the plunge. Things might look broken or weird for a while, so please bear with me while I get things organized. Thanks!
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, for your ranting pleasure, I give you this quote from our country's lead fear-monger:
</p>

<blockquote>
It's absolutely essential that eight weeks from today, on Nov. 2, we make the right choice, because if we make the wrong choice then the
danger is that we'll get hit again and we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the standpoint of the United States.<br />
&#8212; VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY 
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><i>Update: </i></b>Since there's been some controversy surrounding this quote (see the comments), here it is in context, from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/09/20040907-8.html" target="a8_win">transcript</a>. See if reading the surrounding text changes your impression of the original quote's meaning. (I have to say, it doesn't change mine.) 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We made decisions at the end of World War II, at the beginning of the Cold War, when we set up the Department of Defense, and the CIA, and we created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and undertook a bunch of major policy steps that then were in place for the next 40 years, that were key to our ultimate success in the Cold War, that were supported by Democrat and Republican alike -- Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower and Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon and Gerry Ford and a whole bunch of Presidents, from both parties, supported those policies over a long period of time. We're now at that point where we're making that kind of decision for the next 30 or 40 years, and <span style="background-color:#E9F592">it's absolutely essential that eight weeks from today, on November 2nd, we make the right choice. Because if we make the wrong choice, then the danger is that we'll get hit again, that we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the standpoint of the United States</span>, and that we'll fall back into the pre-9/11 mind set if you will, that in fact these terrorist attacks are just criminal acts, and that we're not really at war. I think that would be a terrible mistake for us. 
</p>

<p>
We have to understand it is a war. It's different than anything we've ever fought before. But they mean to do everything they can to destroy our way of life. They don't agree with our view of the world. They've got an extremist view in terms of their religion. They have no concept or tolerance for religious freedom. They don't believe women ought to have any rights. They've got a fundamentally different view of the world, and they will slaughter -- as they demonstrated on 9/11 -- anybody who stands in their way. So we've got to get it right. We've got to succeed here. We've got to prevail. And that's what is at stake in this election.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="title">Yay, Dr. Wu! Boo, Hemotechnologist!</h3>

<p>
 When Al and I moved to Philadelphia, one of the draws was that it was close to our families&#8212;meaning we'd have a built-in support system if we decided to take the plunge and have children (or, I should say, a child). I, for one, couldn't imagine having kids without having help, and the fact that my sister is in Baltimore and Al's brother is in New York means that any kid we had would have cousins nearby (key if we only had one, which is all I could agree to up front). The other bonus was that my gynecologist, a fabulous woman whom I've been seeing for 12 years&#8212;despite moves from Virginia to Connecticut and California&#8212;would be a 2 1/2 hour drive away rather than a 5 hour flight. What I didn't consider was that (a) my gynecologist is not also an obstetrician (she's a surgeon), and (b) in any case, 2 1/2 hours is too far away for regular obstetrical care. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/belly090904.jpg" alt="the belly on september 9, 2004" width="264" height="499" class="inline-right">Unfortunately, my doctor didn't have any recommendations for obstetricians in Philadelphia, but one of her nurses had an idea: She suggested I pick the hospital at which I'd like to deliver, and then call the labor and delivery floor at the hospital and ask the nurses on duty which doctors they liked. I looked at a bunch of local hospital websites before making a choice based mostly on the availability of whirlpool baths in every room, the lack of emphasis on frilly decor, and a description of the hospital and obstetrical services that was informative without being patronizing. I then called the labor and delivery nurses and was told that the practice associated with the hospital was very good. Me: &quot;But do you have a favorite doctor, one that you particularly like working with?&quot; Nurse: &quot;That would be all of them.&quot; So I called the practice and scheduled an appointment.
</p>
<p>
After my first visit, with a doctor who seemed  nice enough but only scored a 4 on my puts-me-at-ease-and-makes-me-want-him/her-in-the-delivery-room scale (of 1 to 10), I started to worry. I reminded myself that I'd have at least 9 more visits at which to bond with someone (and then to hope that that person was on call&#8212;or willing to come in&#8212;when I went into labor). The next two visits were with a nurse practitioner who rated a 6.5, which made us hopeful&#8212;until we learned that she doesn't do deliveries. Next we saw the midwife, whom we'd heard good things about&#8212;and who seemed very nice and down-to-earth&#8212;but since our visit only lasted about 5 minutes, neither of us formed a firm impression. For that reason, she rates a 5, though if at some point we get to know her better, we reserve the right to revise our rating.
</p>
<p>
At this point, I did start to panic a little. Four visits down, and still no strong bond with anyone. The front desk staff (which, I must say, do nothing to make me feel good about the practice; a little professionalism, maturity, and diction would go a long way) tried to set  up my next appointment with the nurse practitioner again, but I asked to see someone new, since the NP didn't do deliveries. Luckily, I only had to move the appointment date out one day to get Dr. Wu.
</p>
<p>
AND THANK GOD FOR DR. WU. I now have hope! She rated an 8 at least, which was a huge relief. She gave me her full attention as I went through my issues and questions (now that I think of it, she never even approached the computer); she was the first to confirm my suspicions that my weight gain was a little on the high side (everyone else kept telling me it was &quot;fine&quot;); she had recommendations for the heartburn (it's OK to take Prilosec again, no need to wait until October) and hemorrhoids (try a cream with cortisone); and she put my mind at ease about the spate of Braxton-Hicks contractions I've been having. 
</p>
<p>
She told me that my uterus is measuring about 1cm larger than normal for my date (not a huge deal, but nevertheless, larger&#8212;to which Al responded when I told him, &quot;well, you've been about a week or two ahead in symptoms all along, and the baby measured about a week ahead of schedule on the ultrasound&quot;), and she suspects, as I do, that the baby's currently in transverse position. (This was my guess based on where the kicks and hiccups are centered.) She said he's still got plenty of time to get into birthing position before we'd need to &quot;discuss options.&quot; I'm sure the visit wasn't significantly longer than most of my others, but it *felt* longer because I had enough time to bond. The eye contact was key, I now realize; everyone else had her attention focused on the computer, her notes (the day the computer was down), or a resident. Dr. Wu focused on *me*. She looked at me, she talked to me&#8212;by god, she even shook my hand when she walked in. Yay, Dr. Wu! Now, how do you feel about episiotomies and a &quot;no shouting&quot; rule in the delivery room? 
</p>
<p>
This was also the visit where I had to do the glucose screening, which turned out to be both not as bad and worse than I imagined it would be. The not as bad part had to do with the Glucola I had to drink; it wasn't cola flavored, as the name implied (and as I'd feared&#8212;I'm so un-American as to strongly dislike Coke), but rather more like extra-sweet Sprite. It took about six gulps, but I got it down. I could feel my teeth rotting within seconds, but I wasn't allowed to eat, drink, smoke, or chew *anything* until I had my blood drawn exactly one hour later. That's where the &quot;worse&quot; part comes in: the blood draw. Instead of going for the vein on the outside of my arm, as most nurses and lab technicians do, this technician steadfastly focused on the more traditional inside vein, despite the fact that it didn't pop up when she smacked it to attention. Consequently, she wasn't able to pierce it on the first try... or the second, or the third. And after the first miss, I was in SERIOUS pain. I could see (and feel) her fishing around with the needle, trying to stick that sucker with all her might. I was wincing and gasping by the time she finally hit the vein, and I glanced over at the collection tube long enough to see the blood dribbling in at a snail's pace. Yep, definitely should have mentioned the outside vein&#8212;and possibly choosing a butterfly setup over a straight needle. I'm now (still) sore, and my poor arm is a bit black &amp; blue. &quot;Next time, just tell us about the other vein, hon,&quot; my technician said after fetching me some water. Don't worry, I will.

<h3 class="title">Bra Breakdown</h3>

<p>
I actually broke down and cried OVER A BRA today. The tears started streaming down my face as I was paying for some maternity hose in a Motherhood Maternity store, and I only barely managed to hold it together until I crossed over the threshold into the mall. At that point, I started sobbing. I stood there, next to a trash can, fishing in my backpack for a tissue with which to stem the tide (and hopefully prevent my mascara from running all over the place). If all nursing bras are as awful as the ones I tried on today&#8212;they were ridiculously thin and ugly, and they made me feel like a trussed-up milk cow&#8212;I'm going to have to find some other solution for nursing (like maybe never leaving the house until the kid can go several hours without a meal).

<h3 class="title">Uniquely Qualified to Judge</h3>

<p>
I've decided to start reviewing bathrooms around Philadelphia (and probably further afield, if we travel in the next three months), mainly because I've been seeing so many of them lately, and I've noticed that I review them mentally anyway. Since I'm starting a new category for these reviews, and it's conceivable that a new reader could happen upon it without having read any of my other posts, let me explain what makes me uniquely qualified to judge public restrooms in the city I live in: I'm pregnant. I'm nearing the end of the second trimester, and at this point I'm lucky to be able to make it 10 blocks between bathroom visits. I certainly have to go before leaving the house, and again upon reaching my destination (if not en route as well). I imagine that by the ninth month, I'll be down to three blocks at most; my husband and I are already planning our nightly walking routes accordingly. Even before I got pregnant, however, I knew about several of these spots&#8212;mainly because I often take long walks around the city.
</p>

<p>
Before I start reviewing, I want to say that I appreciate that these bathrooms are available to me at all; I've learned over the years how to find a bathroom in New York City when necessary, but it's still much easier to find one here in Philly. My bladder thanks you, providers of public (or semi-public) facilities in the City of Brotherly Love. (Btw, for those who don't yet know how to find a bathroom in New York City, I've got one word for you: Hotels.)
</p>

<p>
I've got a backlog of bathrooms in my brain (and obviously, a penchant for alliteration, but that's another topic...), but I don't know how many I'll be able to stay awake to review tonight. Possibly only one. :) 
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.doubletree.com/en/dt/hotels/dining_detail.jhtml?ctyhocn=PHLBLDT&index=0" target="a8_win">Standing O Bar</a></b><br />
<b>Location: </b>Corner of Broad &amp; Locust, inside the Doubletree Hotel<br />
<b>Shortest route to restroom: </b>Enter on Locust, walk straight back past the bar; bathrooms are in the hallway.<br />
<b>Ease of access: </b>Good. I've noticed the staff watching me walk back to the bathroom single-mindedly, but no one's ever said a word.<br />
<b>Quality of facilities: </b>Average. The women's room has only two stalls (now that I'm pregnant, I have to use the wheelchair-accessible one because I can barely clear the belly when I shut the door in the other one) in a fairly cramped space, and the cigarette smoke tends to drift in from the bar (either under the door or through the ventilation system, I'm not sure which). However, there's usually soap in at least one dispenser, seat covers in the stalls, actual paper towels (I'm not a fan of dryers), and, most amazingly, <em>two-ply toilet paper</em>. Fairly soft two-ply toilet paper, especially for a commercial establishment.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://www.starwood.com/sheraton/search/hotel_detail.html?requestedChainCode=SI&requestedAffiliationCode=SI&propertyID=215" target="a8_win">Sheraton Rittenhouse Square</a></b><br />
<b>Location: </b>Corner of 18th &amp; Locust, on the east side of the Square<br />
<b>Shortest route to restroom: </b>Enter on Locust, via the door next to Potcheen (one of the hotel's two restaurants). NB: This door is often locked in the evenings; in this case, enter through the main hotel entrance at the corner of 18th and Locust, pass the reservations desk, and walk straight back until you see a hallway (up two or three steps) to your right. The bathrooms are in this hallway.<br />
<b>Ease of access: </b>Good. I had to ask the location of the restrooms on my first visit, and I was directed pleasantly. Access is very good indeed if you can enter on Locust.<br />
<b>Quality of facilities: </b>Excellent. The women's room is large (at least 6 stalls, maybe more&#8212;I'll update this post later with the actual count), with a lovely sink area and comfy chairs if you need a rest or a place to apply a bandage to a blister; the stalls are standard size and have hooks for bags. As for paper products, there are seat covers, facial tissues (aka Kleenex), and a good supply of paper towels. The toilet paper is standard large roll commercial grade.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://marriott.com/property/propertyPage.mi?marshaCode=PHLDT" target="a8_win">Philadelphia Marriott Downtown</a></b><br />
<b>Location: </b>1201 Market Street<br />
<b>Shortest route to restroom: </b>From Market Street, enter through revolving door and walk counter-clockwise (i.e., to the right) around the rotunda. Pass the restaurant and lobby cafe, and look for a hallway on your right past the potted palm (it's adjacent to a seating area and across from the reservations desk). From Filbert Street, the hallway is on the left (enter at either end of the seating area across from the reservations desk).<br />
<b>Ease of access: </b>Excellent. This is a busy downtown hotel with lots of natural foot traffic. Despite the posted signs that "restrooms are for hotel patrons only," no one will notice or mind if you use the facilities.<br />
<b>Quality of facilities: </b>Good. I think there are four stalls in the women's room, all of average size. They're not in great shape (some are missing hooks, and the in-stall receptacle shared by two of them has been mangled, but the location and accessibility of this restroom can't be beat (it wins hands down over the lines at the entirely-too-small women's room in the adjacent Reading Terminal Market), so I'm not complaining. The toilet paper is standard small roll commercial grade (each stall has several rolls available), seat covers are provided, and the sink area has a nice granite countertop, soap in at least one dispenser, and thick paper towels as well as a dryer. There's also a full-length mirror in which to make sure your skirt is straight or your belly isn't hanging out as you exit.

<h3 class="title">Yet Another Reason Not to Shop at Motherhood Maternity</h3>

<p>
Remember how I said I was buying hose at Motherhood Maternity when I had the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2004/09/bra_breakdown.html">bra breakdown</a>? NEVER AGAIN. I bought a size L based on my height (5'9") and my current weight, at the advice of the "sales consultant," despite the fact that the packaging clearly stated "For best fit, select your size according to your pre-pregnancy weight." Seeing as how everyone's weight gain during pregnancy is different, selecting a hose size based on pre-pregnancy weight seemed dumb, and given that I'm near the top end of the height range, selecting a size that covered my height while putting me at the bottom end of the weight range seemed judicious. (Generally when non-pregnancy tights or hose say 5'4" - 5'10" / 110-165 lbs., they don't mean the hose will fit if you're 5'9" and 165 lbs., which is a very likely scenario. They mean that the hose will fit if you're 5'4" and 165 lbs. or 5' 10" and 110 lbs. You can't be at the top end of both the height and weight ranges if you want to get the damn things past your knees.)
</p>

<p>
Now that I've managed to get these stupid Motherhood Maternity "Firm Support" pantyhose  on, I have several complaints:
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>They're ORANGE. </b>I bought a color called "Pale Nude" because I'm extremely pale, and I have to say that these things are neither pale nor nude. They're a good 10 shades darker than my skin, and a shade I've never seen on any living human, nude or otherwise.</li>
<li><b>They're not supportive, they're just tight. </b>The package says "with Lycra&reg; Spandex" (27% in the leg, in fact), but unlike every other support stocking I've tried, these feel scratchy and tight rather than stretchy and smooth.</li>
<li><b>They're poorly constructed. </b>The effort of trying to pull them up resulted in one of the seams in the panty giving way. I now have a hole at the "gusset" and a runner reaching halfway up my belly. Well, at least it ran up rather than down.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I think I'm going to give up on the whole maternity/support hose idea and just put my feet up as much as possible. I'm not thrilled at the prospect of giving way to the varicose veins, but the trauma and expense of trying to find hose that fit are now worse than painful varicosities.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Is The Septic System Really That Feeble?</h3>

<p>
Another bathroom review, as observed on two recent visits to Strawbridge's.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://www1.mayco.com/common/storemap.jsp?divCode=SC&Site=Gift&storeNo=2&detail=10&Occ=null" target="a8_win">Strawbridge's Department Store</a></b><br />
<b>Location: </b>801 Market Street<br />
<b>Shortest route to restroom: </b>Take the elevator to the 4th floor and turn toward women's shoes. Turn left in the shoe department and follow the aisle to the end. Women's room is on your left.<br />
<b>Ease of access: </b>Good. No one ever looks askance at you for using a department store bathroom, so no need to sneak in. However, the location is a bit tucked away.<br />
<b>Quality of facilities: </b>Weird. There are 80 zillion stalls, far more than will ever be used at one time, especially in a somewhat-past-its-prime department store. The toilet paper is the thinnest I have ever seen in my life&#8212;it's literally more transparent than tracing paper&#8212;which would be bad enough when it comes to keeping your hands dry, but it's also virtually useless as a substitute for a seat cover (there aren't any here). If it's a warm day, you're bound to be sweating, so in addition to providing no protection from the germs and spritz of your predecessor, the ultrathin tissue is guaranteed to stick to your skin&#8212;and be next to impossible to peel off. Expect to be picking bits of toilet paper off you later in the day, or to be squatting as best you can over the seat (PLEASE be neat and wipe up if you spritz!). The water faucets are difficult to work; you have to press down *very* firmly&#8212;and hold down&#8212;to maintain a flow, which means washing one hand at a time. On the plus side, the flush mechanism for the toilets is designed to be foot operated (no leaning over the bowl), the few soap dispensers that aren't broken usually have soap in them, and there are actual paper towels rather than dryers.

<h3 class="title">I Feel Like a Real Person</h3>

<p>
I've had a run of good luck on the self-esteem-while-pregnant front lately. It started with a random visit to the H&amp;M store at Cherry Hill Mall last week (I don't know why I went in, really&#8212;I guess just to see what was trendy at the moment), where I came upon a small maternity section. I ended up finding three pairs of adjustable-waist pants that look great on me, as well as two cool tops. The best thing about the pants is that I look and feel like a real person in them, not a pregnant person. The second best thing is that everything was reasonably priced. Who knew self-esteem could come so cheap?
</p>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/belted_in_belly.jpg" alt="Al took this from the passenger seat with my Samsung camera phone" width="320" height="240" class="inline-left" galleryimg="no">A day or two after getting the great clothes, I had an opportunity to visit a day spa for a pedicure and a pre-natal massage (my first), followed by access to a heated indoor pool where I got to swim for 30 minutes. Ohhhhhhhhhh yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. And as if that weren't enough, the next morning I visited my favorite hair stylist ever (Toni at HUGO Salon in Maryland) for a cut. Her first comment when I plopped into the chair: "Oh my god, look at your boobs!" Yes, it's true: I now have actual boobs rather a top half that falls a few inches short of balancing my hips.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, since hair basically doesn't fall out when you're pregnant, and mine is very thick to start with, I'd managed to grow a helmet that would have protected my noggin quite well in an NFL game. I wasn't sure exactly which way to go with it&#8212;should I cut it wicked short again, or let it grow out?&#8212;so I didn't give Toni much guidance except "please make it funky and flattering." She proposed keeping the length ("too short would look funny with the rest of you," she said, I assume meaning that since I look more like a pear than a curvy pencil now, I need bigger hair to avoid looking like an eraserhead) while still removing about half my hair. (She called this "giving it some ventilation").
</p>

<p>
I was totally thrilled with the result, which was exactly as advertised: I had all of the length, none of the bulk, and bonus spikes (which I love). How did I get so lucky? I've got cool 80s hair, pants that fit, and a totally relaxed and happy body. (Incidentally, the massage therapist remarked that I must not have gained much weight, and when I said that I'd actually gained 25 lbs. already, he said, "it must all be in the belly." So in addition to being trained in pre-natal body massage, he must also have been trained in pre-natal ego massage. I prefer to think that he just really knows what he's talking about. :)

Hey gang&#8212;
</p>

<p>
In the upgrade from Movable Type 2.661 to the new-and-improved MT 3.11, the commenting system changed. I now have the ability to accept comments only from registered users or from anyone (I've opted for "from anyone") as well as to approve comments before they are posted. Comments from registered users who have already been approved once should post automatically; if you haven't registered, you're supposed to see a message that your comment is pending approval of the site owner. I think in some cases this message isn't showing up.
</p>

<p>
While I investigate this small technical glitch, just know that I *am* getting your comments, and that I totally appreciate them. To make commenting easier, consider registering for a TypeKey account, which will allow you to comment on any other MT blog as well. If you don't want to register, that's totally OK&#8212;there'll just be a delay between when you comment and when you see your comment on the site. (The length of the delay depends on whether I happen to be in front of the computer when your comment comes in or not. :) The reason for the approval process, incidentally, is to discourage the purveyors of Viagra, teen sex, and online gambling services from yucking up my site. So far, it's working.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and one more comment about commenting: Generally I close comments on posts after about a week. This lets me (and you) focus on the discussions around the most current posts.
</p>

<p>
Thanks again for all the suggestions, humor, and support!
</p>

<h3 class="title">No Laughing!</h3>

<p>
Yesterday I went for a checkup at the asthma &amp; allergy practice, and the doctor (the one who pontificates on every subject under the sun, I assume to make himself feel like an authority) said to me while actually starting to write it in my chart, "no asthma symptoms, right?" I said, "well, sometimes..." He crossed out "No asthma symptoms" and amended it to "Occasional wheezing that responds to Maxair." I started to say that most of my asthma attacks were brought on by laughing, but Dr. Pontificator was already on to his next subject.
</p>

<p>
Obviously other things trigger asthma attacks for me&#8212;too-vigorous exercise (sprinting, a double shift on the ice); too much snuggling with our cat, Annie; very cold, dry air; very humid air of any temperature&#8212;but since I got pregnant, laughter has been the main asthma attack inducer. Unfortunately, as I discovered last night, my uterus has now gotten so big that really deep breaths are impossible&#8212;a Very Bad Thing when you often suffer laughter induced asthma attacks. I discovered this while attempting to relate <a href="http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/09_16_2004.html" target="a8_win">dooce's story about a kindred spirit in constipation</a> to my husband. I was only about one sentence in when I started laughing, then coughing, then gasping, gurgling, coughing, wheezing, and gasping some more. It was actually pretty frightening.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't find my Maxair inhaler, so I grabbed a slightly-less-safe-during-pregnancy albuterol inhaler and used that... a total of four times. The regular two puffs just didn't do it. I ended up having to sit up in bed for over an hour (I finally fell asleep in that position), coughing and clearing my throat. Yuck. So the takeaway here is: There will be no more relating funny stories to my husband. I may also have to give up reading some of my favorite blogs (gah, just thinking about some of the posts from <a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/" target="a8_win">defective yeti</a> can send me into fits of hysteria), and the newly-minuted Daily Giggle feature in the sidebar will likely gather dust until after I give birth. There Will Be No Laughing Here.

<h3 class="title">Photo Walk</h3>

<p>
I'm starting to feel sluggish and slug-like these days, kinda like I did during the first trimester&#8212;I want to exercise so I don't feel like such a blob, but my energy level is pretty low.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday I resolved to go out for a long walk first thing in the morning, before my energy dropped off to the point where I could barely get up the stairs or lace up my shoes. Since I haven't been on a photography trek in a long time, I brought my Canon 10-D with me to get some <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town_II">about town</a> snaps. (I also figured that this would force me to rebuild the about town II blog, which has been languishing in limbo ever since the database got corrupted a few months ago.) I got a few nice photos, which I'm in the process of posting over at <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town_II/">about town II</a> as we speak. 
</p>

<p>
It was nice to get out in the fresh, fall-tinged air, though I ended up walking so far afield (and at times at such a brisk pace) that I kind of overtaxed myself. By the time I got within about six blocks of home, I was shaking. I'm fine now, despite almost being run over at 21st and Market by an idiot on a bicycle who (a) WAS GOING THE WRONG WAY, (b) RAN A RED LIGHT, and (c) MADE NO ATTEMPT TO LOOK OUT FOR PEDESTRIANS. Hello?!? You're riding RIGHT AT a pregnant woman, you fucking moron! I screamed "JESUS! YOU'RE GOING THE **WRONG WAY**!!" at him when I recovered my wits, and incredibly, he turned and shrugged.
</p>

<p>
I'm getting really fucking sick of bicycle owners (decidedly *not* cylcists) who can't seem to observe the simplest of traffic laws (i.e., stopping at red lights, going the right way down one-way streets or riding on the proper side of the road on two-way streets, riding in the road instead of on the sidewalk) much less common courtesy. Do the cops in Philly really think that these people aren't worth ticketing?

I was complaining yesterday about the seeming obliviousness of the city to idiots on bicycles&#8212;the fuckers who can't seem to obey simple traffic laws&#8212;but today I have hope. On the way back from our pre-natal visit this morning, we saw an electronic sign in the road adjacent to the Penn Bookstore. It read:

<h3 class="title">September Pregnancy Update</h3>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/belly_092304.jpg" alt="Al took this from the passenger seat with my Samsung camera phone" width="292" height="575" class="inline-right" galleryimg="no"> I'm thinking I'll make this a regular monthly feature for the remainder of my pregnancy (which means there will be at most three more entries&#8212;and possibly only two&#8212;depending on when I actually deliver). 
</p>
<p>
<b>I've given up on support hose. </b>Even though I said I was giving up on hose about a week ago, I tried one more suggestion (again from Sally) to try Lane Bryant. They didn't have anything in a support hose, unfortunately (everything was &quot;day sheer&quot; or &quot;ultra sheer&quot;), but the saleswoman, who was also tall, suggested JC Penney. I bought some &quot;sheer support&quot; thigh-highs (something I'd yet to try) and some sheer, low-rise, lace shorts-like pantyhose (figuring that they wouldn't squeeze the belly, and if they didn't provide enough support, at least I could  wear them after I'm done with pregnancy). The thigh-highs actually turned out to be too big (I should have gotten Long instead of Queen; I learned that when the belly isn't a factor, I can get my pre-pregnancy size) and not supportive in the least, and I didn't bother trying the low-rise hose. I'll just save them for next year. 
</p>
<p>
<b>I've found a good bra</b>. I finally heeded the advice of several commenters and tried on a Bravado! nursing bra at that cool boutique called Belly at 16th and Pine. The salesgirl was really helpful (she even adjusted the straps for me), and she provided some good advice on sizing. I ended up buying two bras (one in a &quot;blush&quot; color, the other white with black polka dots, which make me smile) in a size M+. It was a great experience all around; I was glad not to have to order the bras off the web, sight unseen, and I have to give Bravado! two snaps up (no pun intended) for a creative, practical sizing system. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Prilosec has been a godsend. </b>A couple weeks ago, at the pre-natal visit with Dr. Wu, I was told that I could take another course of Prilosec if I needed to&#8212;no 4-month wait necessary. In an attempt to extend the effects, I've been taking it two or three days in a row followed by one day off, rather than the usual 14 days in a row. I sometimes have to eat a couple TUMS Ultras to augment the Prilosec, but so far the strategy is working great. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>I'm surprisingly normal. </b>At today's pre-natal visit (again with the nurse practitioner, whose cool demeanor and slightly wry sense of humor I appreciate), I was told that my glucose test came back normal, and so did my blood results. The former was no surprise to me (I tend toward hypoglycemia rather than diabetes), though the latter was somewhat surprising to the NP. &quot;Anemia often creeps in at this stage, and we usually have to increase iron supplementation,&quot; she explained. My iron levels are great, however, so I can just continue with the prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, my thyroid levels (taken at a visit to the endocrinologist last week) are also normal, my belly is only measuring a fraction of a centimeter larger than normal, and the NP didn't mention my weight at all (even though I've gained about 28 lbs. so far). The baby is also doing well; his heart rate was 140 for the second visit in a row, and he's lying slightly diagonal, with his head down. So far, so good.
</p>
<p>
<b>What I thought were somersaults are really contractions. </b>Remember how I reported that the baby &quot;periodically does this thing that feels like a somersault; it's borderline painful, and usually stops me in my tracks&quot; last month? It turns out that it's not the baby stopping me in my tracks&#8212;it's my uterus. Those are Braxton-Hicks contractions I've been feeling, and they're coming on more frequently these days. I'm virtually guaranteed to get one if I run up the stairs from the basement, and I sometimes get as many as three or four an hour when I'm out walking. Once in a while I even get one while sitting on the couch or in bed. Fascinating, really. 
</p>
<p>
<b>My belly button is still an innie.</b> Yes, still! A black-and-blue ring appeared around it a couple weeks ago, and while it's fainter now, it's still there. So is the indentation. 
</p>
<p>
<b>We've switched sides. </b>Al and I (and our nightstands) have moved to opposite sides of the bed. I'm now on the side that's easier to get out of from a left-lying position (my usual); it also happens to be the side that's closer to the bathroom. This is key, as I have to get up at least twice a night to pee, and I no longer trust my stiff legs and aching hips to get me around the bed. So far it's working out well. 
</p>
<p>
<b>I waddle once in a while. </b>I'm not in full-on waddle mode yet, but it definitely creeps into my walk when I've been sitting for a while or when I'm really tired. Incidentally, it's difficult to get up from a seated or lying position now, and it's getting *really* hard to bend over and pick things up. (Putting on socks is also a chore.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Sleeping is an exercise in frustration (and sometimes, it's just plain exercise). </b>My hips now ache so badly at night&#8212;and my belly is so big and heavy&#8212;that rolling over is downright painful. Trying to get comfortable often results in whimpering and grunting (and occasionally screaming, shrieking, and throwing things), as well as minutes or hours of lying awake. I slept on my back for no less than three lengthy stretches last night and felt no remorse. I figure the baby's doing fine (he's still kicking, punching, and hiccuping up a storm), and whatever position lets me get some sleep is good for both of us (not to mention my hips). 
</p>
<p>
<b>I'm getting tired. </b>In many ways, entering the third trimester is like returning to the first. I haven't been *forced* to nap daily as in the early months, but I definitely wear out faster now, and I do go to bed earlier and nap on the weekends. Going up and down the stairs is wearing me out again, and I've even had some bouts of extreme nausea. Luckily, those aren't daily affairs; they usually only happen when I overexert myself. 
</p>
<p>
<b>H&amp;M is my new favorite store.</b><b> </b>I seem to have outgrown all the stuff at Gap Body, so finding a maternity section at H&amp;M was a very welcome surprise. Even better: the clothes seem to be *made* for tall people. Nothing I've tried has been too small or too short. Al keeps telling me how great I look now, and even the nurse practioner commented &quot;wow, maternity clothes are getting better and better&quot; at my visit this morning. It's kind of amazing that I've been able to find so many great items in the relatively small H&amp;M Mama line; with any luck, they'll carry me through the end of the pregnancy.

<p>
This weekend Al and I were in San Francisco for the beautiful wedding of two friends. When the officiant asked the bride's father, who walked her down the aisle, &quot;who gives this woman in holy matrimony?&quot;, the father replied in a booming voice, &quot;she gives herself!&quot; All RIGHT!! As the bride and groom joined hands, the officiant said some things about marriage that I can't begin to articulate now but that were so true they  made my heart burst and shoot into my throat&#8212;which made my eyes water, of course. Actually, the whole event seemed designed to make my heart swell and my eyes water. The reception was on the 32nd floor of the Westin St. Francis, in a room that featured panoramic views of a city I love (and that the bridge and groom do, too, of course), and the first dance was to I Left My Heart in San Francisco. &lt;sob!&gt; My heart is swelling now just thinking of it, just looking at this snapshot of love. 
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
<img src="/blog/images/t_and_k.jpg" alt="I left my heart in San Francisco; it's where these two found theirs" width="360" height="290" />
</p><p>
 It was a perfect little weekend that reminded us of what we love and miss about San Francisco (just as we've finally gotten used to Philadelphia, ironically). We stayed in SOMA, near the ballpark, and it was cool to see how that area has grown and improved. We had looked at some lofts on either side or Pac Bell (now SBC) Park early last year, and it's still our first choice for where we'd want to live if we moved back to California. (I think it's more likely that we'll live somewhere else&#8212;somewhere other than Philly&#8212;before we make our way back to SF, though.) I got to see my friend Kristin and have dessert and coffee at an incredible bakery at 18th and Guerrero (Cafe Tartine&#8212;I highly recommend the vanilla cream fruit tarts and the rich chocolate brownies), and together Al and I got to visit our favorite place for dim sum (Ton Kiang) and stuff ourselves silly at the Indian buffet near our old house down on the peninsula (the name has changed from Swagat's to Dastoor, and the food is even better than before). Oh, and we also stocked up on See's chocolates, which can't be found here in Philly.  (Is there any doubt now how I've managed to gain almost 30 pounds already with this pregnancy?) Walking around the city and snapping photos inspired me to rebuild the original <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/about_town/">about town</a> database and add a few more photos to it; I'll add a few more over the coming days. 
</p>
<p>
This coming weekend I'll return to another former home city&#8212;Boston&#8212;for another wedding. Two friends who have been together since I was a kid are finally getting married, thanks to the Massachusetts Supreme Court's recognizing their right to do so. It's a little shocking to me that so many in this country would want to deny others the love, comfort, and legal rights afforded by marriage. The idea that these two amazing people&#8212;who have already been sharing their lives for better and for worse, in sickness and in health, for richer and for poorer, raising children and caring for aging parents, changing jobs and starting businesses, building a nest (and then expanding and remodeling it) for more than 20 years&#8212;would be denied the medical decisionmaking, estate planning and inheritance, and other legal rights of spouses is insane to me. Even heterosexual couples who never marry can end up with these rights in many states by virtue of &quot;common law,&quot; for pete's sake. This couple's desire to marry *affirms* marriage, strengthens the foundation of our society, inspires others to live lives of love and commitment. I'm eager to witness this affirmation. And I fully expect to cry.

These editorials ran on the same page of Friday's <i>New York Times</i>, and they're both excellent. If you haven't registered to read the NYT online yet, now's the time&#8212;it's totally free.

<h3 class="title">Food Finds</h3>

<p>
I wanted to mention a couple tasty items I've come across in the past few months and that I've enjoyed again recently.
</p>

<p>
The <b>rootbeer floats</b> at <a href="http://www.taylorsrefresher.com/menus_fb.htm" target="a8_win">Taylor's Automatic Refresher</a> in the Ferry Building in San Francisco are the best I think I've ever had. The rootbeer is delicious, with a nice peppery finish, and the ice cream is smooth and creamy and has a fresh, authentic vanilla flavor. Best of all, the proportions of rootbeer and ice cream are perfect; most floats I've found elsewhere have had too much ice cream and not enough rootbeer. At Taylor's, you have a chance to eat a few spoonfuls of the ice cream, but there's still plenty of rootbeer to quench your thirst&#8212;and your curiosity. I loved trying to identify the faint herbal flavors that lingered on my tongue after each swallow.
</p>

<p>
Taylor's also has excellent <b>garlic fries</b>&#8212;better than the ones at SBC Park, IMHO. They're a bit thinner than the SBC/Gordon Biersch variety, with a better distribution of garlic. The result is a more subtle garlic flavor and fries that remain crispy all the way to the bottom of the cardboard basket. They're well complemented by malt vinegar (which can be found near the ketchup dispensers) and a bit of extra salt. Next time I think I'll try the <b>sweet potato fries</b> for variety... as long as someone else at the table gets the garlic fries. :)
</p>

<p>
On the eastern side of the country, the <b>white pizza with spinach</b> at the <a href="http://www.thefreshgrocer.com/home.cfm?storeID=727" target="a8_win">Fresh Grocer</a> at 40th and Walnut in Philadelphia is not only delicious, it's also an amazing value ($1.60 per humongous slice, including tax). The crust is thin, buttery, and alternately chewy and crispy (think of a very thin pita brushed with butter and lightly broiled), and there's plenty of yummy cheese, garlic, and fresh (not frozen!) baby spinach leaves on top. For me, it's totally worth the nearly 20-block walk each way&#8212;and I can usually pay for a slice with the change at the bottom of my backpack.
</p>

<p>
One word of caution about this Fresh Grocer: While I've found the service at the prepared foods counter to be fairly good, it leaves something to be desired in the rest of the store&#8212;especially at the checkouts and the "customer service" counter. Employees seem more interested in picking up their paychecks and chatting with their colleagues than in waiting on customers. The lack of service attitude is appalling, really, even by Philadelphia standards. I wouldn't recommend buying groceries unless you're feeling especially patient and in good humor. One way to put a smile on your face: Eat your pizza first. :)
</p>

<h3 class="title">Debate!</h3>

<p>
Am I wrong or insane for finding this debate so fucking hilarious? Yeah, Bush has made one or two good points&#8212;I'm happy to admit that, because he's put me in such a good mood. All the whining, the goofy facial expressions while Kerry is speaking, the punchy emphasis on certain words (VICTORY!), the almost bluesy tone he adopts when talking about what it's like to lead the war in Iraq ("and it's SO HARD [babysittin' these guys]"), the talking points he keeps returning to ("he's a flip-flopper!"), hoping that nobody notices they're nonsequiturs... it's belly laugh-inducing, I tell you. 
</p>

<p>
To help you sound less like a Daily Show segment in the next debate, Mr. Bush, I offer the following observations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>You sound stupid when you keep asserting that you meet with world leaders and heads of intelligence agencies all the time, mainly because you say it with such pride&#8212;like they're magnetically attracted to your power and personal charm or something.</li>
<li>When you get flustered, you tend to spew random, unconnected words: Poland! terror! injustice! coalition!</li>
<li>By continually repeating that one can't lead the country if he sends mixed messages, you're actually weakening your argument that you're steadfast and consistent. What you are is repetitive, and possibly intransigent in the face of shifting priorities, intelligence, and political realities around the world.</li>
<li>I wouldn't be so quick to ask for 30 extra seconds to respond to Kerry's points if I were you. It's obvious that you're shooting from the hip, and you're doing yourself more harm than good. To use a hockey analogy, it's like spotting an open passing lane that will let you clear the puck from your own zone&#8212;one that's right through the slot. How are you not seeing the danger of passing in front of your own net? Are you really so focused on clearing the puck that you'd risk getting scored on?</li>
<li><s>Saying, "listen, I'm not stupid," isn't very smart.</s> Al tells me you didn't actually say, "listen, I'm not stupid." Apparently that was just my impression of what you said (which kinda proves my point). What you actually said was, "First of all, of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us. I know that." It sounds just as dumb, as if you'd said, "I'm not <em>delusional</em>, you know." That's the kind of thing that makes you sound *more* delusional, not less. As you've probably heard time and again from advisors and critics, saying doesn't make it so. At this point, you've got to prove it.</li>
</ul>
