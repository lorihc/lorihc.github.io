<h3 class="title">Is The Septic System Really That Feeble?</h3>

<p>
Another bathroom review, as observed on two recent visits to Strawbridge's.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="http://www1.mayco.com/common/storemap.jsp?divCode=SC&Site=Gift&storeNo=2&detail=10&Occ=null" target="a8_win">Strawbridge's Department Store</a></b><br />
<b>Location: </b>801 Market Street<br />
<b>Shortest route to restroom: </b>Take the elevator to the 4th floor and turn toward women's shoes. Turn left in the shoe department and follow the aisle to the end. Women's room is on your left.<br />
<b>Ease of access: </b>Good. No one ever looks askance at you for using a department store bathroom, so no need to sneak in. However, the location is a bit tucked away.<br />
<b>Quality of facilities: </b>Weird. There are 80 zillion stalls, far more than will ever be used at one time, especially in a somewhat-past-its-prime department store. The toilet paper is the thinnest I have ever seen in my life&#8212;it's literally more transparent than tracing paper&#8212;which would be bad enough when it comes to keeping your hands dry, but it's also virtually useless as a substitute for a seat cover (there aren't any here). If it's a warm day, you're bound to be sweating, so in addition to providing no protection from the germs and spritz of your predecessor, the ultrathin tissue is guaranteed to stick to your skin&#8212;and be next to impossible to peel off. Expect to be picking bits of toilet paper off you later in the day, or to be squatting as best you can over the seat (PLEASE be neat and wipe up if you spritz!). The water faucets are difficult to work; you have to press down *very* firmly&#8212;and hold down&#8212;to maintain a flow, which means washing one hand at a time. On the plus side, the flush mechanism for the toilets is designed to be foot operated (no leaning over the bowl), the few soap dispensers that aren't broken usually have soap in them, and there are actual paper towels rather than dryers.
