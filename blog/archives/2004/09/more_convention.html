<h3 class="title">More Convention Coverage</h3>

<p>
I put the computer away while Laura Bush was speaking last night, mainly because I needed time to absorb what she was saying before I could comment on it. After the Beavis and Butthead-like performance of the Bush twins (huh huh, heh heh heh), Laura Bush's speech was compassionate, coherent, reasonably upbeat, and surprisingly smirk-free. It's really too bad she's married to such a schmuck.
</p>

<p>
This morning's Washington Post has a column by Tom Shales (I actually just looked to see who wrote it, and had an "aha!" moment&#8212;I used to enjoy his commentaries when I lived in D.C.) worth reading called <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51308-2004Sep1.html" target="a8_win">Man of Steel Flies into Washington</a>. It's mainly about Arnold Schwartzenegger's speech, but it also includes some analysis of the Republicans' use of TV/technology, as well as this hilarious quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
At the Fox network, the Republican convention is being covered like a happy birthday party for God, with the channel's right-leaning commentators and anchors hanging on for the joyride of their lives, all but turning cartwheels. 
</blockquote>

<p>
We were watching CNN, since neither of us can abide Fox News, but when the TiVo changed channels on us (to Bravo, for the West Wing) at 11pm, I couldn't convince Al to change back to the convention. "There's only so much I can take," he said. He seemed to find it more unnerving and demoralizing than me reading aloud from the 9/11 Commission report.
