Hey gang&#8212;
</p>

<p>
In the upgrade from Movable Type 2.661 to the new-and-improved MT 3.11, the commenting system changed. I now have the ability to accept comments only from registered users or from anyone (I've opted for "from anyone") as well as to approve comments before they are posted. Comments from registered users who have already been approved once should post automatically; if you haven't registered, you're supposed to see a message that your comment is pending approval of the site owner. I think in some cases this message isn't showing up.
</p>

<p>
While I investigate this small technical glitch, just know that I *am* getting your comments, and that I totally appreciate them. To make commenting easier, consider registering for a TypeKey account, which will allow you to comment on any other MT blog as well. If you don't want to register, that's totally OK&#8212;there'll just be a delay between when you comment and when you see your comment on the site. (The length of the delay depends on whether I happen to be in front of the computer when your comment comes in or not. :) The reason for the approval process, incidentally, is to discourage the purveyors of Viagra, teen sex, and online gambling services from yucking up my site. So far, it's working.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and one more comment about commenting: Generally I close comments on posts after about a week. This lets me (and you) focus on the discussions around the most current posts.
</p>

<p>
Thanks again for all the suggestions, humor, and support!
</p>
