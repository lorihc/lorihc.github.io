<h3 class="title">Oh, The Difference a Week Makes</h3>

<p>
Things I can do this Saturday that I could not do last Saturday, the day we were discharged from the hospital:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Ride in a car on pothole-infested Philly streets without crying.</li>
<li>Distinguish my ankles and the tendons in my feet (and, it follows, fit into my shoes).</li>
<li>Get on and off the toilet without assistance.</li>
<li>Climb stairs one leg per step without relying heavily on the handrail to pull myself up.</li>
<li>Get up from my chair while holding the baby (well, most of the time).</li>
<li>Get into bed by myself.</li>
<li>Get out of bed by myself (most of the time).</li>
<li>Fit into my H&amp;M maternity courdoroy pants with the adjustable waist (they're even loose now, and the waist is being adjusted inward on a daily basis).</li>
<li>Walk&#8212;albeit very, very slowly&#8212;to Whole Foods and back.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah, it does. I can't wait til I can go out for longer walks with Austen and do Pilates again, but for now I am content that I can get around with the assistance of only 600mg of Motrin a couple times a day instead of two Percocets every four hours and one Motrin every six. That's a huge improvement.</p>

<p>Ok, now I am scared Lori.  I have spent the last 8.5 months thinking about how wonderful it will be during that euphoric phase when the baby comes home, that is really not all that euphoric from a pain perspective.  Well, I sure am glad that my mom and mother-in-law are all lined up to provide some assistance in the first few weeks.  I had no idea that getting up off the toilet by yourself would be a milestone that I am going to celebrate.  Time to wake up, Shannon.  This is gonna hurt, but it will all be worth it. T minus 4.5 weeks and counting.  By the way, I am seeing the nurse practitioner this week.  If I remember correctly, you guys liked her????</p>
