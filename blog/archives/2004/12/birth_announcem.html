<b>Mom: </b>Swollen, sore, covered in bruises from failed attempts to place an IV, and completely ecstatic.<br />

<p>Lori and Al, </p>

<p>Congratulations!  I'm so happy for all of you and I'm glad that everything turned out so wonderfully.  It sounds like things got a little scary/stressful for a while there, but looking at his cute little face, wow....just... wow.  I can't wait to experience it for myself next month.  :)  Get as much rest as you can so you can be fully recovered and enjoy your son.  You and Al are going to be fantastic parents.</p>

<p>Kevin</p>

<p>PS- Thank you for chronicling your pregnancy for us.  Hearing about another couple�s experiences has helped us make a little more sense of this crazy, amazing time.  Although I don�t think I�ll tell my wife that Austen was breech � that�s her biggest fear right now and there�s no sense in making it worse.  :)  Best wishes again.</p>

<p>Congratulations, and enjoy all of the fun that is about to begin!   It only gets better!   My son was born in December (of 1997).    Our experience shows that you will be sleeping through the night by March! :-)    (and in March you will wake up freaked out that it is so quiet and wonder what is wrong!)</p>

<p>Wow! I leave the country for a week, and you go and have a baby! I was just so amazed, surprised, excited to see Austen's picture on your blog. I thought for sure it would be a couple more weeks. He is absolutely divine, and I couldn't be happier for you and Al! I've got the girls at work hooked on your blog, as well, so they were also very happy to see Austen. Congratulations!!! (do I sense a nod to Jane Austen in that name???)</p>

<p>Yes, you do. :) I think Al's association is with the Bionic Man, since he first proposed the names "Steve" and "Austin"  consecutively during our post-amnio boy name brainstorming session. I loved it right away; I can't remember which of us proposed the alternate spelling to honor Jane (which was our first choice for a girl's name), but after much discussion (and several alternate proposals, including going with the Texas spelling), Austen is what stuck. I won't divulge our first runner up name (no point, since we didn't go with it), but it was also associated with a literary figure.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for all the kind wishes! More updates coming soon...</p>
