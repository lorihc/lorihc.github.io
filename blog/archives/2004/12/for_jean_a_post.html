<h3 class="title">For Jean: A Post Featuring Photos of Al and the Baby</h3>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/al_austen_hospital.jpg" alt="Austen and dad" width="200" height="300" class="inline-left">I'm obviously behind on the blogging; there's one more installment of The Gory Details to post, some more recent photos of Austen are in order, and I have some bathroom reviews waiting in the wings (the reviews will now include an assessment of the changing facilities as well as the paper goods). I hope to rejoin the Washington Post- and New York Times-reading public in the near future, and to resume commenting on politics, government, and Philadelphia soon. 
</p>
<p>
Right now, however, my focus is on getting used to parenting and tending to Austen's every need. Tomorrow parenting may well consume me entirely, leaving nothing but ashes behind by the time Al gets home from work. Yep, that's right: Tomorrow Al goes back to work. I'll be here by myself. (Well, for most of the day; I expect the washing machine repair guy to keep me company for at least 15 minutes, and if the washer isn't fixed by the time he's done installing yet another motor and a new control board, he'll be held hostage here all day until Sears agrees to get me a new washer IMMEDIATELY.) 
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/al_and_austen.jpg" alt="Al watches TV with Austen" width="200" height="300" class="inline-right">Anyway, I'm a little nervous about being left here alone with the baby tomorrow, but hopefully I'll be able to manage. I (and Austen) may just have to endure a little more crying when I  put him in the bouncy seat or the Pack 'N Play instead of handing him off to Al when I have to pee or refill my water bottle or get something to eat. Actually, judging by how erratically I've been eating even *with* help in the house, being alone with Austen might mean that I don't eat at all.
</p>
<p>
We just tried out the Baby Bjorn on me, and we found that it's not an option for now as the straps fall right on an extremely sore part of my anatomy. So there goes my mobility tomorrow. :( Al suggested that the car seat might be the best option for moving Austen around the house with me without having to hold him, but I reminded him that I'm still not supposed to lift anything heavier than the baby&#8212;and the car seat is pretty heavy on its own, even without the baby in it. Rats! Meanwhile, I'm still trying to figure out how to get out of the house for a walk, seeing as how the front steps are very steep and shallow (and there's no handrail), and the egress from the garage is blocked by the combination of the car and all the plywood and drywall that's being stored there by the contractor for our closet project.
</p>
<p>
I might be stuck in the house tomorrow, alternately feeding the baby and, if I'm lucky, blogging. Eating and peeing and running the dishwasher will just have to wait.

<p>Awwww! It's so awesome to see daddies with their bundles of joy. Austen looks SO little in Al's arms! Are newborns really that tiny? So glad you are all doing well and enjoying your son!</p>

<p>Ours is. :) My sister, sister-in-law, and cousin all warned me not to buy Newborn size diapers or clothes, since the baby wouldn't be in them long... but all of them had 9 lb.+ whoppers. Austen really is newborn size; we're guessing he's just over 8 lbs. now, based on his rate of weight gain in the first 10 days., and he's still very much in Newborn size diapers and clothes. He's growing, but still tiny.</p>

<p>Thanks Lori :-)  It's great to see Al and Austen together.  I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to visit you this trip back east... I guess we'll have to meet Austen when he's much bigger.  I hope you had a wonderful Christmas together as a new family. Love, Jean</p>
