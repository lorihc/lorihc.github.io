newborn a new washer!!!!</p>

<p>Right. It's been 6 weeks; after the motor did indeed burn up yesterday afternoon, I finally got Sears to agree to get me a new washer. They approved it at about 4pm today, and we're going to King of Prussia to pick out a new one tonight, Austen willing.</p>

<p>Sounds like it's going to be a wonderful Christmas for you and Al. An adorable new baby, snow and a new washer (vital to a new Mother). Wishing all of you a wonderful holiday season. Thanks for the terrific blogs all year long.</p>
