<h3 class="title">Serving Eighteen to Life</h3>

<p>
Dear Friends:
</p>

<p>
After one month, I can tell you that parenthood is fine; it is pretty much what I anticipated. The best news is that Austen is both cute and relatively healthy. (The worst is that I now understand what my friend Michele meant when she said that after her son Owen was born, she would fantasize about going to a hotel so she could get some sleep.) I have adjusted, however, and am very busy.
</p>

<p>
My world is like an old-fashioned college campus&#8212;without the freedom, of course. Where I once used to walk all over the city and stay out for hours, I now limit trips to about 10 blocks in length or one hour in duration. This lessens the chance that I'll have to use any of the supplies in the diaper bag or bust out a boob in the middle of the CVS. I know that eventually I'll have to change my baby in public (for the record, I had to change an extremely poopy diaper in the Ladies' room at Sears last week&#8212;mainly because the Men's room didn't have a changing table&#8212;but I enlisted Al's help that time. Anyone who had a problem with it could find another bathroom, dammit), but I'm trying to postpone that day for as long as possible.
</p>

<p>
I am fine, really. I look forward to Al getting home from work each day, to getting back to my valuable blogging, to creating, baking, and taking photographs. I have not had time to think, time to write, time to exercise, or time to eat anything but chocolate, but I have had time to swear at the top of my lungs at 3am and to contemplate the future (and at 3am, it makes my hair stand on end). I've had my work here too. Feeding has been my job&#8212;first the left boob, then the right, then the left again, for hours on end, with only thirty- to sixty-minute breaks in between&#8212;but there's also diaper changing, laundry, soothing, rocking, singing, walking, and much more. But like every other new parent, I would rather be doing all of this during the day, and sleeping at night. 
</p>

<p>
I want to thank you again, and again, for your support and encouragement. You have been so terrific to me and to Al. I appreciate everything you have done, your emails, your comments, and your kind, kind words. 
</p>

<p>
Happy holidays,
</p>

<p>Speaking from the vantage point of one year--it gets better pretty quickly after the first couple of months.  The repetitiveness never quite goes away, but at some point the baby turns the corner from being a Lump of Cuteness to being a Rewarding Experience of Cuteness.  </p>

<p>Oh yeah, and he'll start sleeping through the night,  which sort of trumps everything else :)</p>
