<h3 class="title">The College Board</h3>

<p>
<b><img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/breakaway.jpg" alt="Fig. 12: BreakAway sticker" width="150" height="75" class="inline-left" /></b><img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/norrell.jpg" alt="Fig. 3: Norrell pin" width="99" height="60" class="inline-right" />The other night, while watching Clean Sweep (our current favorite home-improvement show), Al said to me, "What would be the one item of mine from the Keep pile that you'd like to see leave the house?" I replied that had he asked me the same question in Mountain View, I would have said his giant television&#8212;but since it fits better in our Philadelphia living room, it didn't bother me as much. I'd have to think about it.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/bulldogs.jpg" alt="Fig. 1: UGA bulldog sticker strip" width="299" height="110" class="inline-right" />"What item of mine would you get rid of?" I asked. Without hesitation, Al said "Your bulletin board." Me: "The big one? Why?" Al: "Because it's huge and messy and looks like something you'd hang in a college dormroom." (Al isn't big on anything that reminds him of a college dorm room or a frat house; he likes clean lines and nearly-bare walls. I could have argued the "huge" point, given that the bulletin board is about the same size as his television, but I let it go.)  I guess he's right that it's sort of messy, but until now I've never even considered getting rid of it. For me it always had too much history attached to it: It's a chronicle of my time in Washington, D.C., Connecticut, and California! It has irreplaceable stickers stuck to it! Where would I put those buttons if I couldn't hang them on the bulletin board?
</p>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/weta.jpg" alt="Fig. 4: WETA Member sticker" width="200" height="150" class="inline-left" />I thought about it for a few minutes, and then I said, "I can get rid of the bulletin board. I have a smaller one if I need a place to stick things,  and I think I can let go of all the stuff that's attached to the big one." I meant that in the emotional sense as well as the physical sense. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/choice_not_chance.jpg" alt="Fig. 6: Parenting by CHOICE button" width="152" height="136" class="inline-right" />That brings us to this entry, which is all about letting go of the emotional attachments, so I can let go of the board and its physical attachments. It probably won't be of interest to anyone but me, but I've found it useful to blog about this stuff so I can get rid of clutter without jettisoning the associated memories. It's like a scrapbook for items that can't actually fit in a scrapbook.
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/nirvana.jpg" alt="Fig. 2: Nirvana sticker" width="299" height="131" />
</p>
<p>
The College Board, as I have come to think of this thing that my husband would like swept away, is home to the following items (in roughly chronological order):
</p>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/anti_bush.jpg" alt="Fig. 5: Anti-Bush/Pro-Choice sticker" width="199" height="186" class="inline-left" /><b><img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/ice_chalet.jpg" alt="Fig. 22: Ice Chalet sticker" width="199" height="249" class="inline-right" />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A strip of UGA bulldog stickers, purchased while working at the UGA Bookstore in 1989 or 1990. I don't know what I'd intended to stick the bulldogs on, but I never got around to it. They ended up all together in the lower left corner of the cork board.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A Nirvana sticker, front and center.
</p>

<p>
<b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A tiny Norrell pin, from my days as an office temp. I arrived in Washington, D.C. with $100 in my bank account, a $99 speeding ticket in my pocket, a B.A. in English, and the ability to type 80 wpm. I quickly learned that no one was willing to pay a just-out-of-college English major the $22,500 I'd figured it would cost me to live in D.C., so I started temping within days of my arrival. My cost-of-living estimates turned out to be frighteningly accurate; my first year of temping earned me $19,000. Can you say "credit card debt"? 
</p>
<p>
<b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A sticker indicating that I contributed to WETA, one of Washington, D.C.'s several NPR stations. I also gave to WAMU, which I listened to more often; I'm keeping the coffee mug WAMU gave me as a thank-you gift. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/counted.jpg" width="150" height="141" class="inline-left" alt="Fig. 8: I was COUNTED! sticker" /><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A sticker reading "Anti-Bush, Anti-Court, Pro-Choice." I believe I acquired this when I participated in a Pro-Choice march and rally in D.C. The Bush in question is George H. W., not his offspring; I couldn't have imagined in 1991 that it would still be relevant in 2004. 
</p>

<p>
<b><img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/clinton_gore.jpg" width="200" height="198" class="inline-right" alt="Fig. 7: Clinton/Gore campaign sticker" />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A button that reads "Parenting By CHOICE Not Chance", acquired at the NOW store in D.C. I love this button; maybe I should keep it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A Clinton/Gore sticker from when I volunteered for their campaign in 1992. 
</p>

<p>
<b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A small, pink, round sticker that says "I was COUNTED! April 25th, 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation". I remember that the organizers told us to wear white (it shows up better on TV, apparently); I wore a long white skirt, a white blouse that looked kind of like a doilly, and my green 8-eye Doc Marten boots. I also wore 45 sunblock on my bare arms and face, but I forgot to apply the stuff to my ears. They fried like bacon, scabbed over, and fell off in pieces over the next two weeks. 
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/macromedia.jpg" alt="Fig. 20a: Macromedia sticker" width="199" height="125" />&nbsp;
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/shockrave.jpg" alt="Fig. 20b: Shockrave sticker" width="199" height="125" />
</p>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/wwf.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="inline-left" alt="Fig. 9: WWF sticker" /><b>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A World Wildlife Fund sticker I got for contributing to the cause. 
</p>
<p>
<b><img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/uga.jpg" width="299" height="151" class="inline-right" alt="Fig. 10: UGA Alumni Society sticker" />10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A University of Georgia Alumni Society sticker I kept even though I didn't contribute to the cause. 
</p>

<p>
<b>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>An Apple Computer sticker I got from work, circa 1994. 
</p>

<p>
<b>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The BreakAway sticker that came in the box with my new Bell bicycle helmet. The bicyle I bought at the same time was stolen two weeks later when I accidentally missed the frame while fighting to close the Kryptonite lock. I kept the extra front tire (and the lock, which were all that remained) as a backup in case the replacement bike I bought the next day ever needed one. I finally gave it away in 1998, after the second bike was stolen from the garage of my apartment building in San Francisco. The shattered Kryptonite lock, which was all that remained this time, was unsalvageable. The Bell helmet was stolen with the bike. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/bass_northwest.jpg" width="300" height="162" class="inline-left" alt="Fig. 13: Bass Northwest sticker" /><b>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A sticker from Bass Northwest, a super cool store devoted to bass guitars in Seattle, WA. I visited this place while on a train trip around the country in 1994; a matching sticker is on the cover of my journal from that trip. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/claim_check.jpg" width="150" height="140" class="inline-left" alt="Fig. 14: Baggage-claim sticker" /><b>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A baggage-claim sticker from the return flight to IAD from LHR. I went on two business trips to London when I worked at the World Bank; I can't remember which one this was. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/iworldbadge.jpg" width="249" height="193" class="inline-left" alt="Fig. 15: Mecklermedia name tag" /><b>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A Disney-quality Mecklermedia's iWorld name tag that I wore at one of the many Mecklermedia conferences I attended as an employee/speaker. I worked at Meckler for one year before leaving to join the company everyone thought I worked for. <br clear="all" />
</p>

<p>
<b><img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/kareem.jpg" width="199" height="173" class="inline-left" alt="Fig. 16: Kareem Campbell sticker" />16.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A Kareem Campbell sticker that I think came in the box with a pair of skateboarding sneakers I got on a trip to Maryland. I never did get a skateboard to go with them, and they weren't that comfortable to walk in, so they were long ago given to a friend's kid. Thus ended, at age 28, my dream of being a skate punk. I think the dream started at 28, as well. 
</p>

<p>
<b><img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/askme.jpg" width="199" height="183" class="inline-right" alt="Fig. 17: Ask Me About Dreamweaver button" />17.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>An "ASK ME ABOUT DREAMWEAVER!" button. I can't remember if it was made for UCON in 1997 (where we announced that the product was coming) or Fall iWORLD 1997 (which coincided with the release of Dreamweaver 1), but I remember wearing it proudly. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/usga.jpg" width="199" height="178" class="inline-left" alt="Fig. 18: USGA membership sticker" /><b>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A USGA membership sticker. I think my mom bought me the membership when I finally started to understand how she could find golf fun and signed up for 6 lessons. 
</p>

<p>
<img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/cnet.jpg" width="249" height="244" class="inline-left" alt="Fig. 19: c|net sticker" /><b>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A huge c|net logo sticker that I think I acquired at a builder.com conference in New Orleans in 1998. 
</p>

<p>
<b>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Two Macromedia stickers: One with the logo and web address of the company, and one with the logo and web address of the now-defunct shockrave.com. <br clear="all" />
</p>

<p>
<b><img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/applecomputer.jpg" alt="Fig. 11: Apple Computer sticker" width="200" height="204" class="inline-left" /><img src="/blog/images/memorabilia/skateworks.jpg" alt="Fig. 21: SkateWorks sticker" width="225" height="106" class="inline-right" />21.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A nifty Skate Works sticker I picked up on a visit to the Redwood City shop. I can't remember why I went. 
</p>

<p>
<b>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>My Ice Chalet admission sticker for the 06/15/2000 Open Skate. I don't think this was the first time I used my brand-new hockey skates, but it was one of the open skate sessions I attended in an attempt to learn how to skate before buying hockey gear on June 20. 
</p>


<p>
<b>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>A Switch sticker that commemorates Al's third gift to me, given in November 2000, two weeks after we started dating: a Burton snowboard with Switch bindings. I'm still speechless.
</p>

<h3 class="title">At Home in Philadelphia</h3>

<p>
On the day before we moved into our new house (aka My Sister's Birthday), I started compiling a list of the Top 10 Things That Will Take Some Getting Used to About Philly. I only ended up with six items; I figured that I'd come up with the remaining four over the next few days or weeks. A funny thing happened on the way to number ten, however: Philly started to grow on me. 
</p>
<p>
It's partly because I *am* getting used to it,  partly because I'm starting to find some good restaurants and favorite haunts, and partly because I'm staring to look at Philly as &quot;my town&quot; rather than eyeing it with the skepticism I usually reserve for public toilet seats. In order to put this newfound appreciation for Philly in perspective, here's my original list of six items, which for the most part still apply:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The honking. People honk at the drop of a hat here. (And at the change of a light: There's a 1-2 second delay between when the cross street's light turns red and yours turns green. People honk  as soon as the cross street's light turns red. If they're first in line, they just go, often getting to the other side of the intersection before the light even turns green.)</li>  
<li>The lack-of-service attitude. If you ask anyone behind a counter (or a badge)  what's the first word that comes to mind when you say &quot;service,&quot; I bet they'd respond, &quot;huh?&quot; </li>
<li>They salty food. There *are* other seasonings, you know. And kick it up a notch, for pete's sake! </li>
<li>The need to assert your rights as a pedestrian, as loudly and aggressively as you can, to avoid being mowed down (though you WILL get honked at regardless&#8212;see item 1).</li>
<li>The accent. </li>
<li>The smokers. I know, I know: I moved here from California, a state with a reputation for health (among other things), where there's no smoking in restaurants or bars. It's not so much the smoking in bars that's surprising here; it's the smokers on the street. These  people aren't smoking to look cool&#8212;in fact, they look anything but, with cigarettes protruding from pursed lips or slack jaws as they drive, stand in line at the cheesesteak cart, or shuffle down the street. They're smoking because they have to, and they're EVERYWHERE. I find myself running to get in front of the smokers, so I don't have to walk in their exhaust trails.</li>
</ol>
<p>
And herewith, a list of things that make me feel at home in Philadelphia, mixed with recent discoveries that give me hope for the future:
</p>
<ol>
<li>You *can* get good Thai food here; I had some last night at Erawan (23rd &amp; Sansom). When the waiter asked how spicy I would like my red curry shrimp, I replied, &quot;I can take more spiciness than the average Philadelphian, but I'm not Thai.&quot; He replied, &quot;medium spicy, then.&quot; I'm pleased to report that &quot;medium spicy&quot; was measured on the Thai scale, not the Philadelphia one; the dish was right at the limit of my spiciness tolerance, and not too salty.</li>
<li>I've found an allergist and an endocrinologist, which means I'm no longer living on borrowed time (and dwindling prescriptions). Next on the list: a good dentist.</li>
<li>Everything except the Home Depot is in walking distance (and most trips to Home Depot require a car to lug back the lumber and paint anyway). I can walk to my doctors' offices, the bank, the post office, the drugstore, the bakery, Whole Foods, Starbucks, K-Mart, Lord &amp; Taylor, and a whole lot of non-chain restaurants and  shops. On Saturday, Al and I walked around with no particular destination, just because we could&#8212;and there was a lot more to see than there would have been in Mountain View.</li>
<li> There's a Dmitri's at 23rd &amp; Pine! Several people (including <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/management/exec_bios/nkm.html" target="a8_win">a culinary connoisseur friend</a>) have recommended this restaurant to us, but we've never been because it's all the way over at 3rd &amp; Catherine. Well, on our &quot;aimless&quot; walk on Saturday, we discovered that there's a Dmitri's at our end of town as well. We can't wait to try it out.</li>
<li>There's an ice rink 15 minutes away in Pennsauken, NJ that has Friday-night pickup hockey, and the University of Pennsylvania Class of 1923 Ice Rink, which has open skating sessions just about daily, is 10 blocks away.</li>
<li>We can take the subway to see <a href="http://www.philadelphiaflyers.com/" target="a8_win">Flyers</a> and <a href="http://www.phantomshockey.com/" target="a8_win">Phantoms</a> games. No waiting in line for $13 parking, and no waiting in a longer line to get the hell back on the highway. </li>
<li>The end of the <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/archives/cat_kitchen_remodel.html">kitchen remodel</a> is in sight, which means we'll really feel like we're living in our new house (not just camping in it). </li>
<li>Along the same lines, we finally settled on a new couch. It'll be here January 15! </li>
<li>The flood of mail addressed to the former occupants of our address has slowed to a mere trickle.</li>
<li>We've had visits from three friends, and from my sister and her kids. I wish we'd known about the Dmitri's on Pine when the friends came, but we found (and re-visited) a yummy Italian place called Bronzino on 17th at Rittenhouse, and we got to visit some of Philly's historical sites with the kids. (Funny how when you live in a city, you never really check out its tourist attractions unless someone from out of town comes to visit.) The yummy Italian food made me realize that instead of looking for California's specialties (Mexican and Asian-of-every-persuasion), we should learn to appreciate the excellent Greek and Italian places here. And running around town with the kids made me see Philadelphia as a more-activities-than-you-can-possibly-try-in-one-day kind of place. J and M have already made a list of all the things they want to do next time they come, and they've requested an overnight stay. </li>
</ol>

<h3 class="title">Separation Anxiety</h3>

<p>
I had almost completed a post on the deep depression I have been plunged into by the inability of my new iPod to hold a charge, when for some reason my attention was captured by a story in my daily NYTimes e-mail, and I clicked on the link. Of course the page opened in my last-used browser window, which contained my post about the iPod. It's all gone now....
</p>

<p>
Here's the gist: I love my iPod. It's not working. I'm very, very sad.

<h3 class="title">iPod Update</h3>

<p>
I've sent my iPod in for repair, and I'm hoping Apple can figure out what's wrong with it and get it back to me asap. Of course, I know I'm not getting back the same iPod&#8212;I've had a couple days to get used to this idea as I waited for Apple to send me a special shipping box&#8212;but I'm hoping that the one I do get back will have my name engraved on it, as the original did. (My husband is very sweet, no?)
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I am consoling myself by trying to re-create my playlists in iTunes, using a borrowed Powerbook. It has all the songs I need in the Library, but since I created most of my playlists directly on the iPod, I'm not sure if I've re-created them exactly. When I requested repair services for the iPod I was informed that it was my responsibility to back up all the data on the thing before sending it to Apple, but of course that's the problem: something's wrong with its Firewire port, so it will neither charge nor mount when plugged into the Powerbook.
</p>

<p>
Though it's not the same as slipping the iPod into my pocket and plugging the earbuds into my brain, the Powerbook is helping me stay above the depression line, and for that I'm grateful. I spent all day listening to Moody III (my extended-beyond-the-length-of-a-CD remix of <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2003/12/moody_ii.html">Moody II</a>, aka Tunes to Code By) on repeat yesterday, and today I am shuffling the Non-Classical/Non-Xmas playlist. It's something I can see myself doing often, so I've started another sidebar item called Today's Shuffle Surprise. Even without classical and Christmas, it seems my musical tastes are a bit varied...

<h3 class="title">Of Celebrity Poker and the NFC Championship</h3>

<p>
Was anyone else reminded of the way <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Celebrity_Poker_Showdown/Recaps/Game_5.shtml" target="a8_win">Mimi Rogers played poker in her head-to-head matchup against David Cross</a> while watching the NFC Championship Game yesterday?
</p>

<p>
In case it isn't immediately obvious what I'm talking about, let me 'splain. Mimi Rogers was playing really well&#8212;while patiently explaining the mechanics of Texas Hold 'Em to idiot Scott Stapp&#8212; until the game got down to two players. At that point, she suddenly went from playing aggressively to playing defensively. She checked way too often, giving David a chance to bluff&#8212;and to get her to lay down several winning hands in a row. It was all about not losing rather than winning... so David won. 
</p>

<p>
To my eye, that's what happened to the Eagles yesterday. Before the game, one of the CBS commentators (yes, CBS&#8212;there were pre-NFC game updates during the AFC game) reported that the Eagles were concerned with not losing a third straight NFC Championship. I turned to Al and said, &quot;Uh-oh.&quot; Uh-oh was right. Whereas the Panthers came into the game with confidence, even braggadocio&#8212;and <a href="http://www.superbowl.com/news/story/7017951" target="a8_win">backed it up</a>&#8212; the Eagles played tentatively, as if they were scared to lose. 
</p>

<p>
As the Panthers' secondary pummelled the Eagles' wide receivers and a defensive lineman broke Donovan McNabb's ribs, my thoughts moved from Mimi to the time I hurt my tailbone snowboarding at Heavenly. I figured I could still board the next day, as long as I didn't fall down. Consequently, I fell getting off the chairlift&#8212;and every 5-10 feet thereafter&#8212;until I was a sobbing, hysterical mess who couldn't even stand up on the board long enough to clear the lift area. Oh, how I wish the Eagles had gone into the game intending to win&#8212;intending to shred the mountain, as it were&#8212;instead of trying not to fall down. Maybe then they would have bet big instead of checking.

For the first time in weeks, there was no message from YoDude in my Inbox this morning. I'm, like, totally bummed.

<h3 class="title">On the Ability to Beat Bush</h3>

<p>
It seems like every interview I hear or read these days with average-Joe Democrats on whom they're going to vote for in the primary has the following gist: "I just want to vote for the guy who can beat Bush." I'm wondering: Is there any Democratic candidate who is so compelling to Republicans that they'll vote for him instead of Bush? And, given this "anybody but Bush" sentiment, is there any Democrat who will vote for Bush just because s/he doesn't care for the Democratic nominee?
</p>

<p>
My guess, on both fronts, is no. So I guess my real question is: Is there *anybody* who will vote for Bush *solely* because they don't care for the Democratic nominee? And, conversely, is there any Democrat currently in the race who could compel an Independent/Libertarian/Other who voted for Bush last time around to vote Democratic this time? Or is the concern over the ability to beat Bush really a concern that if the "wrong" candidate is nominated, people faced with two unpalatable choices won't vote at all, and that this somehow favors Bush?
</p>

<p>
I guess there are enough "swing" voters&#8212;that is, voters who decide for whom they will vote based on personality, stance on a specific issue, or the lesser of two evils, regardless of party affiliation&#8212;to make the difference in this election. Bill Clinton did beat a sitting Republican president, after all (though probably with the help of Ross Perot, who drew votes from Bush the Elder); Michael Dukakis seemed to lose solely because he was portrayed as weak and dorky; and Reagan was loved (or at least preferred to a Democratic party in disarray) by all but die-hard liberals. I might just be hanging out too much with folks who are at one end of the political spectrum or the other (and I might be too far to one end myself) to fully appreciate the power&#8212;and the motivations&#8212;of the undecideds in the middle, but is the choice between any Democratic nominee and George W. Bush all that difficult to make?
</p>

<p>
I'm curious: What goes into your decision about which candidate to vote for in the general elections (not the primaries)? Do you identify strongly with one party or another? If not&#8212;like me&#8212;do you consider yourself liberal or conservative on specific issues that tend to align you with one party or another, even though you might be registered as NPA or Independent? Do you have a litmus test for your candidate (for example, you'll only vote for a candidate who is pro-choice or pro-life)? If the candidate you voted for in the primary (if applicable) doesn't end up being your party's nominee, are you less likely to vote? 
</p>

<p>
Personal attacks or hateful rhetoric will be edited out, so consider stating your case without them.
