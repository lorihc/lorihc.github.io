<h3 class="title">Of Celebrity Poker and the NFC Championship</h3>

<p>
Was anyone else reminded of the way <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Celebrity_Poker_Showdown/Recaps/Game_5.shtml" target="a8_win">Mimi Rogers played poker in her head-to-head matchup against David Cross</a> while watching the NFC Championship Game yesterday?
</p>

<p>
In case it isn't immediately obvious what I'm talking about, let me 'splain. Mimi Rogers was playing really well&#8212;while patiently explaining the mechanics of Texas Hold 'Em to idiot Scott Stapp&#8212; until the game got down to two players. At that point, she suddenly went from playing aggressively to playing defensively. She checked way too often, giving David a chance to bluff&#8212;and to get her to lay down several winning hands in a row. It was all about not losing rather than winning... so David won. 
</p>

<p>
To my eye, that's what happened to the Eagles yesterday. Before the game, one of the CBS commentators (yes, CBS&#8212;there were pre-NFC game updates during the AFC game) reported that the Eagles were concerned with not losing a third straight NFC Championship. I turned to Al and said, &quot;Uh-oh.&quot; Uh-oh was right. Whereas the Panthers came into the game with confidence, even braggadocio&#8212;and <a href="http://www.superbowl.com/news/story/7017951" target="a8_win">backed it up</a>&#8212; the Eagles played tentatively, as if they were scared to lose. 
</p>

<p>
As the Panthers' secondary pummelled the Eagles' wide receivers and a defensive lineman broke Donovan McNabb's ribs, my thoughts moved from Mimi to the time I hurt my tailbone snowboarding at Heavenly. I figured I could still board the next day, as long as I didn't fall down. Consequently, I fell getting off the chairlift&#8212;and every 5-10 feet thereafter&#8212;until I was a sobbing, hysterical mess who couldn't even stand up on the board long enough to clear the lift area. Oh, how I wish the Eagles had gone into the game intending to win&#8212;intending to shred the mountain, as it were&#8212;instead of trying not to fall down. Maybe then they would have bet big instead of checking.
