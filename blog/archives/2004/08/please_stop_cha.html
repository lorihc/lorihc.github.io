I'm listening to Arnold Schwartzenegger speak at the Republican National Convention at the moment, and while he's often compelling, he's not always coherent. I didn't really understand the comment about all the troops he's met not buying the "two Americas" concept&#8212;or rather, I didn't believe it. Many of those troops are the best example there is of the gulf between rich and poor, between those who have opportunities and those who don't. How many of those troops *are* troops because it was the only way they could afford college or get vocational training?

So far Arnold's made some good points about what Republicans stand for (as well as some bad jokes about his movies), and he's done his best to make it sound as if there's room for everyone in the Republican Party, even if you can't quite get behind the gay bashing and the desire to roll back women's rights. But I have to say, I found the chants from the crowd of "USA! USA!" at various (inopportune) moments during his speech completely unnerving, and in incredibly bad taste. I love this country, and I feel so privileged to have been born and grown up here... but when people chant "USA! USA!" after a remark about how this country knows better than the United Nations, I feel embarrassed. Please, people, don't make me embarrassed to be an American. Please stop chanting.
