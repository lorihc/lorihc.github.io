<h3 class="title">Back With a Due Date Debate Update</h3>

<p>
We're back from our Last Hurrah cruise and still adjusting to walking on dry land. It's harder than you might think&#8212;the sidewalks keep tilting. Although I didn't bring my laptop with me, and I didn't pay the exorbiant Internet access fees on the ship, I did keep a hand-written journal of our exploits, and I'll be posting to our <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/">lori-and-al</a> site with the details in the next day or two. (Or as soon as I re-construct that blog and its trashed database; I hosed all the blogs at lori-and-al.com last month when our server ran out of space. I'm adding them back one at a time under MT3.0.)
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, here's an update on the Due Date Debate logic puzzle. Remember, even I won't know the solution until I actually deliver; all I know is the due date according to my calculations, the doctors' calculations, and the ultrasound technician's measurements. The original clues, given on July 29, were as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>By all estimates, Lori is scheduled to give birth sometime in December, 2004. </li>
<li>Lori's estimate of the due date, which is based on when she thinks she conceived, is 3 days later than the doctors' estimate, which is based on LNMP (last normal menstrual period).</li>
<li>The ultrasound technician's estimated due date is two days earlier than the doctor's estimate.</li>
<li>There have been two guesses so far as to the actual date of delivery, neither of which matches the due date estimated by Lori, the doctors, or the ultrasound technician.</li>
<li>Lori's estimate is between the first day of Hannukah and the last day of Christmas Week.</li>
<li>The baby currently weighs 1 lb., according to the ultrasound.</li>
<li>It's possible that the baby will be born in November, but very unlikely that it will be born in January.</li>
<li>Norwegian Cruise Lines will not accept passengers who will have entered their 24th week of pregnancy as of the last day of the itinerary.</li>
<li>A typical pregnancy lasts 40 weeks; babies delivered between the 37th and the 42nd week are considered "at term".</li>
<li>Lori's grandmother has guessed December 12, 2004 at 6:05pm.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The guesses so far, in addition to my grandmother's as given above, are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Mom: December 17 (one of the original two guesses)</li>
<li>Jimmy: December 21 at 10pm</li>
<li>Josie: December 5&#8212;wait, cancel! cancel!&#8212;December 15 between 2am and 4am</li>
<li>M, my 9 year-old niece: December 13 (or Christmas Day, or maybe November 25&#8212;she can't decide)</li>
<li>J, my 11 year-old nephew: November 24</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additional clues:
</p>

<ul>
<li>One of Josie's guesses matches the estimate of either the doctors or the ultrasound technician. This is the only guess to match any of the estimates.</li>
<li>I'm now in my sixth month of pregnancy.</li>
<li>I've gained 19 pounds.</li>
<li>As of last Thursday, my belly looked like <a href="/blog/images/bellyupdate08.html" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('/blog/images/bellyupdate08.html','belly_v','menubar=yes,width=319,height=540');return false;">this</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Cruise Journal is Live</h3>

<p>
OK, I've finally got the <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/">lori-and-al</a> blog database rebuilt and all the cruise entries and photos posted. You can see them <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/archives/last_hurrah_cruise/">all here in chronological order</a>. I figured I'd end on a nice note&#8212;photos of our last day at sea&#8212;rather than describing the disembarkation process. Actually, disembarkation itself wasn't *too* bad; it was more the chaos outside the terminal that got to me.
</p>

<p>
I'm not very good in crowds, and I'm especially anxious now that I have a belly to protect. As when we arrived for our cruise, there was complete pandemonium on the sidewalk outside the terminal, with porters forcibly clearing paths for themselves with the carts they pushed, hundreds of people with luggage all trying to figure out what the system for getting a cab was, and hundreds more being dropped off for the next cruise.
</p>

<p>
We got a ticket for the cab queue, and Al and I attempted to get behind the section 3 sign, where we were told to wait. Al got through the crowd, but I got my suitcase stuck on someone, and while politely waiting for them to move out of the way, I lost my opening. The porters pushed through from the other direction&#8212;and I do mean pushed. They literally shoved me backwards with their carts as I frantically tried to protect the belly. Unfortunately I was pushed into another group of people, who shoved back, nearly toppling me over my suitcase and onto a cart. I fought the urge to panic.
</p>

<p>
When I finally managed to unentangle myself and force my way through to Al, I broke down and started to cry. The whole scene was totally stressing me out. Al was very sympathetic, tried to comfort me, and took more blame than he was probably due for abandoning me to the crowds. After that he was ultra-protective, shooing away anyone who came within two feet of me.
</p>

<p>
We finally got a cab and made it to Penn Station at around 12:30pm; obviously we'd missed the 11:05am unreserved train that we'd intended to take. (The ship docked as scheduled at 9am, but it took over two hours to clear customs, and then we could only disembark according to baggage tag color&#8212;which in turn corresponded to travel arrangements and deck number.) The next train was the all-reserved (and all-booked) 1:05pm regional, so we hung out for the 2pm Keystone service. Once we got on the train, it was smooth sailing. Er, no pun intended.
</p>

<h3 class="title">I Guess I Don't Know the Secret Handshake</h3>

<p>
Ever since I got pregnant&#8212;and especially since I started showing&#8212;I've been smiling at every other pregnant woman I pass as if to say, &quot;Hi! I'm in the club, too! Isn't it neat?&quot; To date, I've never gotten a smile back. Well, except from the mirror alongside the escalator at Macy's yesterday, but that doesn't count. 
</p>

<p>
I've felt a bit saddened by this; I  expected to experience some solidarity with my fellow pregnant sisters. Is it that they recognize me as someone who came to impending parenthood only reluctantly? Is it  obvious that I'm a traitor to my original plan, an imposter? Or is it because, although I'm in my sixth month and no longer have a clear view of my feet, I don't look pregnant enough to warrant acknowledgement by women who've reached the waddle stage? 
(&quot;Face it, honey,&quot; says Al. &quot;You're mini-pregnant.&quot;)
</p>

<p>
I've gotten some acknowledgement in the form of wonder-filled questions about pregnancy from non-pregnant people; I'm beginning to think that I have more in common with these folks than I do with other pregnant women. I feel just as much awe as they do that anyone would take this on. Could it really be that the  pregnant women I've encountered aren't feeling the same sense of wonder, the same incredulity, the same oh-my-god-I'm-not-sure-I-can-do-this anxiety that I am feeling? Is pregnancy really such a non-event for the women of Philadelphia? 
</p>

<h3 class="title">So 1984</h3>

<p>
Just drove back from my sister's house in Maryland. After three days of sisterly bonding, swimming in a fabulous inground pool, and baby-soft fabrics (for both me and the bambino-to-be), I must say that it was quite disconcerting to see highway sign messages exhorting drivers to REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY posted at regular intervals during the two and a half hour trip. After the fourth sign, I started to wonder if I was driving through Communist China or 1984. I figured that since the signs were in English, it must be my timing that was off, not my location.

<h3 class="title">Celebrity in the Hood</h3>

<p>
My husband is no fan of blogs, blogging, or bloggers. He loves me, of course, but he tries to forget that I blog. Despite this aversion to blogging&#8212;and because of the connection I feel to certain bloggers and their chosen subjects, and my penchant for telling him what I read that day&#8212;he knows who <a href="http://www.mightygirl.com/" target="a8_win">Mightygirl</a>, <a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/" target="a8_win">Defective Yeti</a>, <a href="http://chezmiscarriage.blogs.com/chezmiscarriage/" target="a8_win">Chez Miscarriage Woman</a>, and <a href="http://rittenhouse.blogspot.com/">Rittenhouse Guy</a> are.
</p>

<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, <b>Rittenhouse Guy</b> has moved into the neighborhood. He's literally <em>right around the corner</em> from us. There is a possibility of coffee in our future. I am petrified.
</p>

<p>
I am petrified of being boring. Of being ill-informed, ill-read, ill-prepared to discuss current events. Of being far more interesting on my website (ha!) than I am in person. Of being judged, as much for what I have as for what I lack. I think this (and the fact that it usually takes a Herculean effort to drag me out of the house for any social event) is what kept me from going to more Girls' Brunch events when I lived in the Bay Area. A Girls' Brunch book-swap/brunch is where I met <a href="http://www.mightygirl.com/" target="a8_win">Maggie</a>, though she probably doesn't remember me; I also met a <a href="http://www.megnut.com/" target="a8_win">bunch</a> <a href="http://www.minjungkim.com/" target="a8_win">of</a> <a href="http://megan.scatterbrain.org/notmartha/index.html" target="a8_win">other</a> <a href="http://mena.typepad.com/" target="a8_win">cool</a> <a href="http://www.jzissman.com/bio.html" target="a8_win">women</a> who happen to have blogs at that and another GB event, but instead of really bonding with these women and developing real-life friendships, I felt like the least-cool person in the room both times and just sort of slunk away. 
</p>

<p>
So, I am petrified. I'm looking forward to meeting Rittenhouse Guy, of course, since he's the source of most of my Philadelphia knowledge (I started reading his blog in preparation for the move), but I also harbor a secret wish to remain anonymous behind my keyboard. Given that he's likely to be out on his front steps smoking a cigarette someday as I pass on my way to the library or to Whole Foods, a meeting seems inevitable. I just hope he doesn't think I'm a dork.
</p>

<p>
My husband, meanwhile, is a little unnerved. The only thing that could possibly be weirder is if <a href="http://www.dooce.com/" target="a8_win">dooce</a> moved in next door.
</p>

<h3 class="title">9/11 Revisited</h3>

<p>
I have a bunch of things I wanted to write about (and probably will at some point over the next couple days), but the thing that's jumped to the top of the list with a bullet (or a boxcutter, as the case may be), is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393326713/ref%3Dnosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">9/11 Commission Report</a>.
</p>

<p>
I finished a rather innocuous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553578391/ref%3Dnosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Jane Austen mystery</a> the night before last, so I picked up the next book in my pile, which happened to be the 9/11 report. I was riveted from the first page; it's the little details about the hijackers, the hijackings, and the various responses at all levels, from airport ticket counter personnel to security screeners to air traffic control, the FAA, and NORAD, that completely and utterly fascinated me.
</p>

<p>
I started reading huge passages out loud to Al, but after about five or six of these, he asked me to stop. He found it too unnerving and sad, and he was afraid he wouldn't be able to sleep. For me, sadness didn't really come into play. There were things I found a bit shocking, but for the most part I was riveted in a forensic sense (in the same way I can look at the truly gruesome photos in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849381568/ref%3Dnosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Practical Homicide Investigation</a> and say to myself, "ah, so that's what a .45 caliber handgun does to a skull when fired at close range").
</p>

<p>
I read a bit more after Al's request that I stop reading aloud, but as I was tired (and a little concerned that Al might be right about the details disturbing my sleep&#8212;at this point, just about everything else, from a sore belly to leg cramps to hellacious heartburn to a hungry cat, is making it impossible to sleep well, and adding another reason for sleeplessness didn't seem like a good idea), I turned out the light in the middle of the section on NORAD and the FAA.
</p>

<p>
As it happened, I fell asleep right away and slept better than I have in days (except for one incident in the middle of the night where Al apparently tried to comfort me&#8212;I must have been whimpering&#8212;and accidentally woke me up instead). I didn't dream about hijackers or desperate passengers trying to break down the door to the cockpit on Flight 93 or the NORAD chain of command. Instead I dreamed about joining Al on a 160-mile walk in Montana that was somehow related to his fantasy football draft (which is tonight), about forgetting to pack my thyroid medication for the trip, and about <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/000135.html">Jonah</a> sharing our accommodations there (and taking too long in the shower). I slept straight through until 8:30am without having to get up to pee or walk around to relieve the pressure on my sore hips, without Annie waking me up by trying to pry open her food bowl down in the living room, and without stomach acids trying to burn a hole in my esophagus. I can't wait to read more of this amazing report tonight.

<img src="/blog/images/annie_phone.jpg" alt="annie investigates my new camera phone" width="258" height="335" class="inline-left" galleryImg="no" title="annie investigates my new camera phone" />I think Annie is trying to warm us up for parenthood. Actually, she's been doing this to me ever since I moved in with Al three years ago. It was a giant step for me to become a pet owner, to know that I was responsible for feeding and watering and caring for another creature. As I bonded with Annie and got up to feed her in the morning and took her to the vet for checkups and shots, I became a little more confident that I could care for a child. I still occasionally forget to put fresh water out for her (food I can remember, but for some reason water not so much), but she loves me anyway.
</p>
<p>
Lately, however, Annie seems to have implemented Operation Crash Course in Parenting. She's taken to waking up in the middle of the night and walking around the bed crying. She gets up at 3:30am and attacks her (timed) bowl in the living room, trying (noisily) to pry it open. She follows me around all day, begging for food in the most pathetic squeak possible. She suddenly wants to sit on my lap all the time. She won't listen when I tell her it's time to stop crying, that dinner isn't for another 2 hours. 
</p>
<p>
It was during one of these &quot;Annie, stop crying. You've already had your turkey&quot; speeches that I realized I was talking to her as I'll probably end up talking to my child: Calmly, reasonably... and expecting her to care. I try to remember when I get so exasperated that I practically start pleading, &quot;ANNNNIEEEEEEE, STOP CRYING!&quot; that it's not going to work with a baby any more than it works with Annie. I can try petting, soothing, or feeding the baby, but reason isn't going to work until the kid is at least three or four years old (if I'm lucky). Pleading probably won't either, for that matter.
</p>
<p>
The good news is that when Annie's not on a crying jag, or begging for food, or otherwise being ornery, she's utterly charming. She's taken to flopping on the floor next to the bed, or in the middle of the kitchen, or at my feed in the living room... in short, wherever I happen to be. She just chills out and enjoys keeping me company. Now, if I can get that from our baby, I'll be one happy momma.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Addendum: </b>It occurred to me that Annie probably thinks I'm talking to her when I talk to the belly, since I use the same tone of voice. She's going to be *really* confused when the baby comes...</i>

I thought I'd say a few words now, for anyone who might be interested (i.e., my far-flung friends and relatives). For those of you who don't care, feel free to move along.
</p>
<p>
<b>I caved and colored my hair. </b>I've been <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/webcam.html">bleaching (and sometimes coloring) my hair</a> since 1991, and I'd been putting drugstore-variety peroxide in it since long before that. Before about two weeks ago, I hadn't seen my natural hair color since I was 14. I'd read that you shouldn't dye your hair while pregnant, but the advisories always mentioned dark colors, so I figured bleaching was OK. Turns out that obstetrical care personnel also worry about the massive doses of peroxide and ammonia in hair bleach, and I was advised (after already bleaching once in blissful ignorance during the first trimester) not to bleach or color my hair. After feeling like a granny with frosted tips the whole time I was on the cruise, however, I couldn't take it any longer, and I bought some (semi-permanent) Clairol Natural Instincts in a dark blond shade that seemed fairly close to my root color and subjected myself to 10 minutes of chemicals. It feels weird to have hair this dark, but oh, so much better than having two-toned tips.
</p>
<p>
<b>The heartburn is killing me. </b>Everything I've read says that heartburn can be a problem in the first trimester (because of hormones) and the third trimester (because the baby pushes your stomach up into your throat), but that the second trimester is basically heartburn-free. THAT IS SO WRONG, at least for me. The only time I've been heartburn-free was during the two weeks I was on Prilosec OTC in late June, and those two weeks were absolute heaven. Unfortunately, I can't take another round of Prilosec until late October. Until then, I'm barely getting by on massive quantities of TUMS, and I eat after 8pm at my own peril. 
</p>
<p>
<b>The baby is an active little booger. </b>His kicks are now strong enough that they sometimes keep me awake at night, and if you put your hand on my belly, I can guarantee you'd get booted. (I wouldn't advise putting your hand on my belly without asking, though. I've had two t-shirts printed up to warn off potential belly rubbers; the first, shown in the photo at right, says &quot;Hands Off the Belly&quot;, and the second, which is in the wash because I spilled milk on it  while trying to drink out of the carton, says &quot;Touch the Belly, Lose an Arm&quot;.) The baby seems to move more after I empty my bladder, as if he's like, &quot;finally, more room to stretch out!&quot; He also periodically does this thing that feels like a somersault; it's borderline painful, and usually stops me in my tracks. 
</p>
<p>
<b>My belly button is still an innie</b>, although the innards are gradually working their way outward. The area all around the belly button is very tender; if for some reason you are given permission to touch the belly, STAY AWAY FROM THE BUTTON.
</p>
<p>
<b>We're trying out a name. </b>I don't plan to announce the name of the baby until after he's born (partly because we don't want people voting on names, and partly because we might change our minds when we see him), but when it's just the two of us, we refer to the baby by name to see how it sounds. So far we're going with my choice for a first name and Al's choice for a middle name (since it's a boy its middle name will be Korean and follow a generational pattern specific to the Cho family, and I don't think Al trusted me to come up with a name that didn't mean something awful in Korean). 
</p>
<p>
<b>December looks awfully far away. </b>I know my belly isn't *that* big (although I was bigger than my mom ever got with either of her pregnancies weeks ago), but I'm starting to get nervous about how much bigger it's going to get. Other signs that I should be closer to the end than I am: I've gained about 24 lbs., my hips ache at night, my lower back has started to hurt, and I've got a few painful varicose veins in my legs. I promised myself I wouldn't talk about the hemorrhoids, so let's move on, shall we? At least I don't have any stretch marks yet. (I'm applying Palmer's daily and praying.) 
</p>
<p>
<b>Things are getting dire in the bra department. </b>So those of you who've been pregnant before already know this, but for those of you who haven't (for whatever reason, including gender), one of the first signs of pregnancy is that your boobs get sore. And then they get big. Chances are you'll outgrow your bra before you outgrow your pants. That's what happened to me&#8212;twice (and let me tell you, bras ain't cheap). I read that underwire isn't good if you plan to breastfeed, but I can say from experience that I could find no alternatives to underwire in my size that provided enough support (aside from two sports bras worn simultaneously, which are too squishy to be worn for long). So in the end, I got an underwire bra or two. Now that my belly's getting bigger, though (and my boobs are continuing to expand), I'm finding that the wire is digging into me, and I can see how this would be a bad thing for milk ducts. I have no idea how to solve this problem without sagging (and believe me, I'm not worried so much about aesthetics&#8212;sagging *hurts*). I may have to go check out the maternity/nursing bra options, unless anyone has a better suggestion.
</p>
<p>
<b>Gap Body is still my favorite store. </b>I'm telling you, that store was made for pregnant women. They have the most comfortable &quot;lounge pants&quot;, workout shorts, t-shirts, and stretchy bras (for sleeping in). Most bottoms have wide, flexible waistbands designed for freedom of movement in a yoga class, I assume, but they're also ideal for giving an expanding belly room to breathe. At least half of my maternity clothing budget has been spent there, and I'm guessing that I'll be able to wear these items in the months after the kid arrives, as well. Yay, Gap Body! 
</p>
<p>
<b>We now have another guess in the Due Date Debate that matches one of the official estimates </b>(mine, the doctors', or the ultrasound technician's). My friend Eric T., after studying all the clues closely, has hit upon December 7, 2004 at 7:30am as the moment baby Hylan-Cho will arrive. Do with that information what you will.

<h3 class="title">Getting Behind the Governator</h3>

<p>
OK, I will be the second to admit (Al was first) that I might have been wrong about Arnold Schwartzenegger. He's actually starting to look like a pretty decent governor. My main objections to him at the time of the recall were (a) that he was taking advantage of the recall at all; it seemed more like a coup than an election, (b) that there was apparently some disrespect of women and their rights not to be groped in his past, and (c) that he seemed like just another actor who thought his celebrity status made him qualified to be a politician.
</p>

<p>
As far as his politics went, he *seemed* like the kind of Republican I might actually consider voting for&#8212;i.e., fiscally conservative and socially liberal&#8212;though I wasn't sure what he'd really be like once he got into office. As it turns out, he's exceeded my expectations on that front: He's managed to adopt a fairly lassez faire attitude on social issues (for example, by saying that he had no problem with gay marriage&#8212;his problem was with the handing out of illegal licenses rather than challenging the law banning gay marriages&#8212;and encouraging activists to fight it out in the courts), step up on the environment (I worried, as others did, that a 7-Hummer-owning governor wouldn't exactly be environmentally friendly, but he's apparently down to just 3 Hummers now, and he's supporting legislation that would allow high-efficiency hybrids to use the carpool lanes regardless of the number of occupants in the vehicle [more on that below]), and try some wacky new things rather than just govern according to the status quo (for example, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/28/national/28sale.html" target="a8_win">selling off junk that the state was currently *paying* to warehouse</a>).
</p>

<p>
In retrospect, the thing that most stuck in my craw about Schwartzenegger becoming governor&#8212;that he never would have been elected if he'd had to run in a "real" election rather than a recall/coup&#8212;might be the reason California is being treated to some innovation now. Arnold most likely never would have been supported by the official GOP machine because he's too liberal. Much as I hated the means, the end just might justify them.
</p>

<p>
What prompted a discussion of Arnold's performance as governor over coffee this morning were two articles in the New York Times: the one about the state garage sale, linked to above, and one titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/28/national/28hybrid.html?th" target="a8_win">Detroit Fights California Bid to Open Car Pool Lanes to
Fuel-Conscious Import</a>. Detroit's (or, more specifically, Ford Motor Company's and its United Auto Workers') objection to the bill is mainly that it's tantamount to encouraging Americans to buy Japanese because no American-made car would qualify for the carpool lane exemption. 
</p>

<p>
No American-made car would CURRENTLY qualify, they mean. And, of course, no future American-made car would, either, unless there's some incentive for them to do so.
</p>

<p>
My favorite section of the article:
</p>

<blockquote>
As things stand now, only the Prius, which is so popular that dealerships report months-long waiting lists, and the far-less prevalent Honda Insight and Civic Hybrid would qualify. The Ford Hybrid Escape, an S.U.V. coming on the market this fall, is expected to average 31 miles per gallon on highways.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
In his letter on Aug. 16 to Mr. Schwarzenegger, Mr. Ford wrote that the legislation "puts our workers and stockholders at a competitive disadvantage precisely when Ford is entering the hybrid market with a family-oriented, no compromise S.U.V."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
He asked, "How will you be able to tell consumers who purchase this vehicle that they will not be allowed to drive in the car pool lane while other hybrid vehicles can?" 
</blockquote>

<p>
I've got a solution for you, Mr. Ford: If the Ford Hybrid Escape is so "family-oriented", <em>put the whole fucking family in it, </em>and you'll qualify for the carpool lane. Heck, one or two extra family members would do the trick&#8212;no need to fill all five seats.
</p>

<h3 class="title">On Fonts... And On Top</h3>

<p>
The New York Times has a great little article on typefaces in its Arts section today called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/arts/design/29HELL.html?th" target="a8_win">Acceptance Letters</a> (free registration required). Be sure to click on the Slide Show link at the bottom of the article if you're reading online.
</p>

<p>
I noodled around with Fontographer back when I worked at the World Bank and again when I moved to Macromedia (which makes the product), but I never really got the hang of type design. Having a decent design sense is not the same as being a designer, and typeface design is an even more specific skill, so it's not surprising that I failed.
</p>

<p>
In my early days at Macromedia, I worked on the web team with a talented artist and designer named Ardith Iba&ntilde;ez. I remember seeing a poster of a font she designed, called <a href="http://www.fabric8.com/bazaar/product.f8ml?PID=AD0101" target="a8_win">Metro Manila</a>, hanging just off the main lobby at the 600 Townsend office and thinking, wow, I wish I could do that. I still do.
</p>

<p>
Also in the New York Times Arts section this morning is an article on a totally different subject: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/arts/television/29DOMI.html?th" target="a8_win">Porn aimed at women</a>. The people behind the new Playgirl TV service interviewed a bunch of women about what they'd like to see in porn, added their own observations to the mix, and came up with some pretty interesting conclusions about how to make features that are more appealing to women. Sounds like they're on the right track, though I can't verify personally because the service isn't available in Philadelphia (yet).

<p>
I was out running some errands in the car today, and I ended up listening to NPR rather than putting in a CD. In a promo for an upcoming show the local WHYY announcer noted, "One of this country's richest men, Warren Buffett, has a birthday coming up, and it has people wondering..." Was I wrong to assume that she was going to say "what to get him"? Isn't that the thing you usually wonder when someone has a birthday coming up? Instead, she continued, "when he'll retire and who'll replace him." Aw. :(
</p>

<p>
After some interesting commentary about the day's happenings at the Republican National Convention (which I intend to watch this week, much as it may gall me, so I can understand what we're up against), I was treated to a <a href="http://freshair.npr.org/day_fa.jhtml?display=day&todayDate=08/30/2004" target="a8_win">discussion on abortion on Fresh Air</a>. 
</p>

<p>
First to speak was Senator Rick Santorum, who just drives me round the freaking bend. Every time Terry Gross asked him a question, he objected to her use of the words "fetus", "embryo", and "fertilized egg"&#8212;he preferred that they be substituted with "little girl" or "little boy"&#8212;which meant that she had to bring him around to the point over and over again in an attempt to get an answer. She wanted to talk about the provision in the Republican Platform to give equal constitutional rights to a fetus and how those might conflict with the host organism&#8212;namely, the woman carrying the fetus; he wanted to point out that &quot;over 99% of abortions in this country have nothing to do with the health or life of the mother; they have to do with the convenience or the desire at that point in time in the woman's life not to have a child.&quot; Um, how exactly does this have nothing to do with the life of the woman? In the sense that it wouldn't <em>kill</em> her to have a child? Santorum actually uses the phrase &quot;life consequences to the mother&quot; as well, again meaning, I would assume, that it wouldn't kill her to have a child. Does he really think there are no &quot;life consequences&quot; to bearing a child? Regardless of whether the woman chooses to raise the child herself or not, as a pregnant woman, I am here to tell you, Senator Santorum, that there CERTAINLY ARE &quot;life consequences&quot; to carrying a child&#8212;ranging from heartburn, hemorrhoids, weight gain, varicose veins, stretch marks, insomnia, and round ligament pain to anxiety, depression, nausea, and extreme fatigue. And for Christ's sake, we haven't even gotten to labor and delivery yet, much less the next 18-30 years of emotional, physical, educational, and financial responsibility. I would argue strenuously that being able to choose whether and when to have children is fundamental to women's rights. (But, of course, giving a fetus &quot;equal&quot; rights isn't really about equal rights at all&#8212;it's about valuing the rights of the fetus *above* those of the woman carrying it. OF COURSE THOSE RIGHTS ARE GOING TO COME INTO CONFLICT.) 
</p>
<p>
While I could understand (despite being  appalled by) the idea of an exception to a ban on abortion when the pregnant woman's life is in danger being somehow equivalent to committing murder in self-defense, I don't think Santorum ever fully answered Gross' question about exceptions in  the case where a pregnancy could compromise the health of the woman. His response was, &quot;Again, the law is very clear on this point... if your life is threatened, then you can respond in kind. If something less than that, then you can respond in less than that.&quot; Huh? Is it possible that he's advocating partial-birth abortions? (Sorry, bad joke.) No, judging by his further comments, I suspect he meant that your only possible response is medical intervention (short of terminating the pregnancy) to try to mitigate any negative health effects. 
</p>

<p>
Senator Santorum next pissed me off by asserting the Republican Party line that Democratic judges are somehow &quot;activist&quot; judges who create new law, while Republican judges are &quot;traditionalists&quot; who merely interpret it. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/15/opinion/15lithwick.html?th" target="a8_win">Bullshit</a>. Gross was right to call him on that point, to suggest that perhaps the judges the Republicans wanted to appoint had just as much of an agenda&#8212;namely, to overturn Roe v. Wade.
</p>

<p>
It's hard for me to articulate what so frustrated me about Santorum's final story, a highly personal one about his and his wife's choice to perform a risky, in vitro operation on their unborn child in an attempt to improve its chances of living rather than to abort the pregnancy or let the baby die once delivered. I felt great sympathy for them and the hard choice they had to make; incidentally, it's what most women (I'd even go so far as to say &quot;over 99%&quot;) go through when deciding whether to terminate a pregnancy. The operation ended up causing an infection, which in turn caused premature delivery of the child at 21 weeks. And here's the part that's hard to articulate, because I can't point to anything Santorum *said* that particularly annoyed me. It was more the sense of awe, the profound effect that witnessing the 2-hour life of his son had on him... and the implication that only someone who truly appreciates life could have had the same reaction. Santorum gave the impression earlier in the interview that women who choose abortion are being anti-life, when most are hardly so cavalier. Most people (yes, women included!) have a profound respect for life, and despite Santorum's assertion that continuing a pregnancy has no &quot;life consequences,&quot; I can't think of anything more profoundly consequential. Deciding whether to have children can be agonizing, and whether you choose to go ahead with a pregnancy or not, you are choosing life. 
</p>

<p>
 The second half of Fresh Air was devoted to an interview with the President of Planned Parenthood, Gloria Feldt. Even though I support her position, I was a bit disappointed that she was often as given to rhetoric as Santorum. She did, however, make two points that I thought were pretty interesting. One was that Planned Parenthood (along with other anti-violence groups) opposes the so-called &quot;Laci Petersen Law,&quot; which makes it a separate crime to harm the unborn fetus of a pregnant woman, because it does not increase penalties for harming pregnant women, who are 20% more likely than non-pregnant women to be assaulted and killed. It does nothing, in other words, to protect pregnant women from abuse. It does, however, establish a fertilized egg as having legal standing as a person. Can anyone say &quot;legal precedent&quot;? 
</p>

<p>
The other interesting point she made had to do with the partial birth abortion ban. Rather than try to rephrase, I'll quote her directly here, because I think she describes the situation pretty well:
</p>
<blockquote>
The abortion ban, which was passed by Congress and signed by President Bush last November...outlaws abortions even as early as the beginning of the second trimester for any reason. It outlaws a vague and undefined range of techniques that doctors use in order to be able to provide the best care for their patient[s]&#8212;and by that I mean  doctors are always trying to protect the woman's health and her future fertility, her future ability to bear children. So this law is unconstitutional under Roe; an almost precisely identical law has already been overturned by the United States Supreme Court. And again, Congress knows this, John Ashcroft knows this, George Bush knows this&#8212;but the Ashcroft Justice Department is aggressively defending this law in spite of the fact that it is unconstitutional because he [Ashcroft, presumably] hopes that by the time it works its way up to the Supreme Court, <em>there will be a different Supreme Court. </em>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now there's a chilling thought.

Is it just John McCain's speaking style, or is this how he sounds when his heart's not in it?

<p>
I'm listening to Arnold Schwartzenegger speak at the Republican National Convention at the moment, and while he's often compelling, he's not always coherent. I didn't really understand the comment about all the troops he's met not buying the "two Americas" concept&#8212;or rather, I didn't believe it. Many of those troops are the best example there is of the gulf between rich and poor, between those who have opportunities and those who don't. How many of those troops *are* troops because it was the only way they could afford college or get vocational training?
</p>

<p>
So far Arnold's made some good points about what Republicans stand for (as well as some bad jokes about his movies), and he's done his best to make it sound as if there's room for everyone in the Republican Party, even if you can't quite get behind the gay bashing and the desire to roll back women's rights. But I have to say, I found the chants from the crowd of "USA! USA!" at various (inopportune) moments during his speech completely unnerving, and in incredibly bad taste. I love this country, and I feel so privileged to have been born and grown up here... but when people chant "USA! USA!" after a remark about how this country knows better than the United Nations, I feel embarrassed. Please, people, don't make me embarrassed to be an American. Please stop chanting.
