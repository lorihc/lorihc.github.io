<h3 class="title">Back With a Due Date Debate Update</h3>

<p>
We're back from our Last Hurrah cruise and still adjusting to walking on dry land. It's harder than you might think&#8212;the sidewalks keep tilting. Although I didn't bring my laptop with me, and I didn't pay the exorbiant Internet access fees on the ship, I did keep a hand-written journal of our exploits, and I'll be posting to our <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/">lori-and-al</a> site with the details in the next day or two. (Or as soon as I re-construct that blog and its trashed database; I hosed all the blogs at lori-and-al.com last month when our server ran out of space. I'm adding them back one at a time under MT3.0.)
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, here's an update on the Due Date Debate logic puzzle. Remember, even I won't know the solution until I actually deliver; all I know is the due date according to my calculations, the doctors' calculations, and the ultrasound technician's measurements. The original clues, given on July 29, were as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>By all estimates, Lori is scheduled to give birth sometime in December, 2004. </li>
<li>Lori's estimate of the due date, which is based on when she thinks she conceived, is 3 days later than the doctors' estimate, which is based on LNMP (last normal menstrual period).</li>
<li>The ultrasound technician's estimated due date is two days earlier than the doctor's estimate.</li>
<li>There have been two guesses so far as to the actual date of delivery, neither of which matches the due date estimated by Lori, the doctors, or the ultrasound technician.</li>
<li>Lori's estimate is between the first day of Hannukah and the last day of Christmas Week.</li>
<li>The baby currently weighs 1 lb., according to the ultrasound.</li>
<li>It's possible that the baby will be born in November, but very unlikely that it will be born in January.</li>
<li>Norwegian Cruise Lines will not accept passengers who will have entered their 24th week of pregnancy as of the last day of the itinerary.</li>
<li>A typical pregnancy lasts 40 weeks; babies delivered between the 37th and the 42nd week are considered "at term".</li>
<li>Lori's grandmother has guessed December 12, 2004 at 6:05pm.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The guesses so far, in addition to my grandmother's as given above, are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Mom: December 17 (one of the original two guesses)</li>
<li>Jimmy: December 21 at 10pm</li>
<li>Josie: December 5&#8212;wait, cancel! cancel!&#8212;December 15 between 2am and 4am</li>
<li>M, my 9 year-old niece: December 13 (or Christmas Day, or maybe November 25&#8212;she can't decide)</li>
<li>J, my 11 year-old nephew: November 24</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additional clues:
</p>

<ul>
<li>One of Josie's guesses matches the estimate of either the doctors or the ultrasound technician. This is the only guess to match any of the estimates.</li>
<li>I'm now in my sixth month of pregnancy.</li>
<li>I've gained 19 pounds.</li>
<li>As of last Thursday, my belly looked like <a href="/blog/images/bellyupdate08.html" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('/blog/images/bellyupdate08.html','belly_v','menubar=yes,width=319,height=540');return false;">this</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi Lori, <br />
Jack's wife Lori here.  I've been reading your blog since you two shared a cubical wall at MM and I could sometimes catch him on your webcam  anyway - I wanted to guess...</p>

<p>December 20th 10:15 am</p>

<p>Happy Pregnancy!<br />
Cheers<br />
Lori</p>
