<h3 class="title">Celebrity in the Hood</h3>

<p>
My husband is no fan of blogs, blogging, or bloggers. He loves me, of course, but he tries to forget that I blog. Despite this aversion to blogging&#8212;and because of the connection I feel to certain bloggers and their chosen subjects, and my penchant for telling him what I read that day&#8212;he knows who <a href="http://www.mightygirl.com/" target="a8_win">Mightygirl</a>, <a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/" target="a8_win">Defective Yeti</a>, <a href="http://chezmiscarriage.blogs.com/chezmiscarriage/" target="a8_win">Chez Miscarriage Woman</a>, and <a href="http://rittenhouse.blogspot.com/">Rittenhouse Guy</a> are.
</p>

<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, <b>Rittenhouse Guy</b> has moved into the neighborhood. He's literally <em>right around the corner</em> from us. There is a possibility of coffee in our future. I am petrified.
</p>

<p>
I am petrified of being boring. Of being ill-informed, ill-read, ill-prepared to discuss current events. Of being far more interesting on my website (ha!) than I am in person. Of being judged, as much for what I have as for what I lack. I think this (and the fact that it usually takes a Herculean effort to drag me out of the house for any social event) is what kept me from going to more Girls' Brunch events when I lived in the Bay Area. A Girls' Brunch book-swap/brunch is where I met <a href="http://www.mightygirl.com/" target="a8_win">Maggie</a>, though she probably doesn't remember me; I also met a <a href="http://www.megnut.com/" target="a8_win">bunch</a> <a href="http://www.minjungkim.com/" target="a8_win">of</a> <a href="http://megan.scatterbrain.org/notmartha/index.html" target="a8_win">other</a> <a href="http://mena.typepad.com/" target="a8_win">cool</a> <a href="http://www.jzissman.com/bio.html" target="a8_win">women</a> who happen to have blogs at that and another GB event, but instead of really bonding with these women and developing real-life friendships, I felt like the least-cool person in the room both times and just sort of slunk away. 
</p>

<p>
So, I am petrified. I'm looking forward to meeting Rittenhouse Guy, of course, since he's the source of most of my Philadelphia knowledge (I started reading his blog in preparation for the move), but I also harbor a secret wish to remain anonymous behind my keyboard. Given that he's likely to be out on his front steps smoking a cigarette someday as I pass on my way to the library or to Whole Foods, a meeting seems inevitable. I just hope he doesn't think I'm a dork.
</p>

<p>
My husband, meanwhile, is a little unnerved. The only thing that could possibly be weirder is if <a href="http://www.dooce.com/" target="a8_win">dooce</a> moved in next door.
