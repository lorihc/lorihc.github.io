<p>
I'm now in my fifth month of pregnancy. To those people who know me in real life and not just from this website, this is probably shocking news, given that I always said I didn't want children. To the great credit of just about everyone I've told in the past couple weeks, I've received excited congratulations rather than snarky I-told-you-so remarks. For this I'm enternally grateful, because nothing pissed me off more than being told in an almost-nasty, knowing tone, "oh, you'll change your mind" when I said I really didn't intend to have kids, ever. I'd usually respond politely that of course, like every other human, I reserved the right to change my mind, because circumstances have a way of changing, too. It was just hard to picture impatient, easily-frustrated, independent, e-fare-loving me as a parent, and given that prior to meeting Al I wasn't holding out any hopes of ever being married (heck, I wasn't even interested in <em>dating</em>), having a kid was the last thing on my mind. Add to that a strong fear of childbirth and no interest in going through the tortures of pregnancy, and it's easy to see why kids weren't on my agenda.

<p>
I won't go through all the factors that got me to this point (I mean the emotional and intellectual ones, not the physical one&#8212;I'm sure everyone can infer what actually got me pregnant). I mentioned already that it took much discussion and several leaps of faith; these discussions and leaps took place over the course of about three years, which should squelch any assumptions that I was suddenly overcome by the ticking of my biological clock, or that all I needed to get me to change my mind was to meet the right person. As you can also imagine, considering the length of discussions, the leaps were incremental... though some of them felt huge at the time.
</p>

<p>
In any case, what I wanted to say was this: If I'd lived my whole life never having experienced pregnancy, I don't think I would have looked back at age 90 and said, "gee, I've done so many things, but what I really wish I'd gone through was a pregnancy." I don't think my life would have been any less rich if I'd followed my original plan and never had kids. It just would have been different. Now that I *am* going through pregnancy, however, I can report that it's a fascinating experience. Again, one that I could have lived without and never missed, but fascinating nonetheless. Even the icky stuff&#8212;the first-trimester nausea and exhaustion, the painful expansion of various body parts, and the still-constant heartburn come to mind&#8212;is interesting. It might be so interesting to me precisely because I never expected to experience it, now that I think about it.
