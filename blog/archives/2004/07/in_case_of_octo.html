<h3 class="title">In Case of October Surprise</h3>

<p>
I'm always amazed at how quick pundits are to proclaim, "if the election were held today, I believe [insert name of candidate whose convention just concluded here] would get the nod" after the first convention of the election season. It's like a jury member saying, "well, I think he's guilty" after only hearing the prosecution's case. I certainly HOPE that Kerry, Edwards, and the rest of the Democrats/non-Bushies can sustain the good feeling they've generated this week through to November, but keep in mind that we haven't heard from the defense... er, the Republicans yet.
</p>

<p>
One pundit who really liked Kerry's chances qualified his assessment by noting that events could intrude between now and the election that could swing things in Bush's favor... such as, perhaps, the capture of Osama bin Laden. I'd like to offer the Democrats, free of charge, my idea for a slogan should such an October Surprise occur:
</p>

<p>
You've got Osama, we've got Obama. SO THERE!

<p>It's silly for pundits to even go there...</p>

<p>"If the election were held today and the Republicans didn't get a chance to have their convention, much less suspend elections through back-door legislative tricks or even 'capture' Osama Bin Laden one week before the election, the Democrats would surely win."</p>

<p>This is why I can't stand watching/reading what passes for "news" in this country.</p>
