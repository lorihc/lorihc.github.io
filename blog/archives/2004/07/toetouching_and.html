<h3 class="title">Toe-Touching and Twisted Logic</h3>

<p>
So unfortunately we were not able to tape the ultrasound yesterday, either by recording it through the ultrasound machine or by videotaping the procedure with a camera. Something about medical privacy (perhaps the same medical privacy law that went into effect last year, and that required patients everywhere to fill out consent forms at doctors' offices that they've been visiting for years?). Anyway, the whole procedure lasted about an hour, and there was so much to see that I think I can live without a videotape. The images are burned on my brain (and I also have some printouts to look at, should I forget).
</p>

<p>
My favorite moment was when the technician, Allison, tried to get a shot of his feet (after all, this was the ultrasound where they count and measure all the body parts to make sure everything's OK), and she couldn't get a clear shot of them because he was playing with his toes. SO PRECIOUS. Allison had to jiggle the probe against my belly to get him to let go. When he finally did, we could clearly see that he had ten toes. Good sign!
</p>

<p>
We also got to see our future child rub his eyes, bop himself in the head, bat the umbilical cord around, stretch his legs over his head in a pike position, and wave. And we got a good enough view of his butt area to confirm that we are, indeed having a boy. It was so neat.
</p>

I was a bit worried, given my mom's exclamations over the size of my belly, that I might be carrying the next Yao Ming, but when the whole procedure was over, Allison informed us that the baby's weight was in the 55th percentile (i.e., normal/average/not huge). She (and the doctor who came in a few minutes later) said it's too early to tell how big the baby will be at delivery; it all depends on how well he's fed through the placenta during the third trimester. The doctor also noted that he hasn't really started packing on the fat yet.
</p>

<p>
Another thing Allison told us when she was done was her estimate of the due date based on the bone and organ measurements. Since only I, Al, my sister, and the doctors know my actual due date, and the rest of the family has already started registering guesses and premonitions, I thought it might be fun to offer my own version of a logic puzzle for your Internet enjoyment (albeit one that I won't have the solution for myself until Our Boy arrives). Here's the setup:
</p>

<p>
<a name="duedate"></a>
<b>Due Date Debate</b>
</p>

<ul>
<li>By all estimates, Lori is scheduled to give birth sometime in December, 2004. </li>
<li>Lori's estimate of the due date, which is based on when she thinks she conceived, is 3 days later than the doctors' estimate, which is based on LNMP (last normal menstrual period).</li>
<li>The ultrasound technician's estimated due date is two days earlier than the doctor's estimate.</li>
<li>There have been two guesses so far as to the actual date of delivery, neither of which matches the due date estimated by Lori, the doctors, or the ultrasound technician.</li>
<li>Lori's estimate is between the first day of Hannukah and the last day of Christmas Week.</li>
<li>The baby currently weighs 1 lb., according to the ultrasound.</li>
<li>It's possible that the baby will be born in November, but very unlikely that it will be born in January.</li>
<li>Norwegian Cruise Lines will not accept passengers who will have entered their 24th week of pregnancy as of the last day of the itinerary.</li>
<li>A typical pregnancy lasts 40 weeks; babies delivered between the 37th and the 42nd week are considered "at term".</li>
<li>Lori's grandmother has guessed December 12, 2004 at 6:05pm.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When will Lori deliver the baby?
</p>

<p>Wow, how exciting must that have been!  When my wife had an ultrasound at 8 weeks (precautionary, nothing was wrong), I could have stared at the baby for hours even though she (we are convinced that it's a she) was only the size of a jellybean and we could barely differentiate one end from the other.  You've made me so excited for our next ultrasound (probably in about 6 weeks or so).  If we get as good of a view of our child as you got of your son, I know that I'm going to be a blubbering mess right there in the doctor's office.  </p>

<p>I'm glad that everything is perfect with your son and congratulations!</p>

<p>Thanks! It *was* really fun to see the kid. At the ultrasound we had at the amnio, it was more like looking at a still picture. At this one, we got to see him move more. (Most movement you see is from the ultrasound probe zipping around, so the baby's movements may catch you by surprise -- and totally capture your heart. The technician thought we were so cute for exclaiming "awwww!" in unison when the baby turned his head and flailed an arm. Nothing special to her, perhaps, but it was quite a moment for us.)</p>

<p>Okay...I just can't make a guess on your delivery date from your clues. It's too much like the questions I'll face on the LSAT! But, I wanted to venture a guess nonetheless...I say December 5 sometime between 2am-4am. No wait...that's not near Hannukah and Christmas - cancel, cancel! I'll guess December 15 within the same time frame. My brother's birthday, so it will help me remember Little Al's birthday!! ;-)</p>
