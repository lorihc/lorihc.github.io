<h3 class="title">Voting by Issue</h3>

<p>
My parents, one of whom is a registered Democrat and the other of whom is a registered Republican, seem to be the swing voter types that I'm so puzzled by. Neither of them is particularly impressed with Bush, but they didn't have a real sense of which Democrat they should get behind. Mom has a strong aversion to Edwards (whom she had occasion to meet while she was head of a Community Watch group in North Carolina), and Dad can't stand Dean (I think the primal scream scared him off), but they didn't really know which candidate they were *for*.
</p>

<p>
I'd forwarded them the link to a <a href="http://www.votebyissue.org/primary/" target="a8_win">Vote By Issue Quiz</a> that my friend Valerie had sent me, and which I'd found very educational, but Mom didn't understand how to take it, and Dad didn't have time to. So when they came up this weekend to visit, and the conversation turned to politics, Al and I decided to help them take the quiz. It basically outlines all the candidates' positions on 14 different issues&#8212;without telling you who holds which position. At the end, you get to see which candidates you agreed with on what.
</p>

<p>
We read all the issues and all the positions, and Mom and Dad indicated which position they most agreed with for each issue. (Since the issues and positions are presented in random order each time you visit, even though we had two laptops going, they weren't parallel. I recorded Mom's votes directly in the form, and Al wrote down the first line of each position for each issue for Dad, and then filled in the form accordingly when we were done with Mom's quiz.)
</p>

<p>
I won't reveal which candidates Mom and Dad aligned with, but I did come out thinking that both of them were more liberal than I'd thought&#8212;and the one who's registered as a Republican seemed more liberal than the registered Democrat. It made me wish that they'd barred the Dems from mentioning Bush or his administration at all in their position statements, and that the quiz makers had put Bush's positions alongside all the Dems'. It would have been even more interesting to see whether my parents would have chosen Bush over a Democrat on any of the issues. (When you only have Democrats to choose from, you can't help but choose a Democrat.)
</p>

<p>
In any case, if you're a Democrat or want to vote in your state's Democratic primary, I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.votebyissue.org/primary/" target="a8_win">Vote by Issue Quiz</a> as a tool to help you figure out which candidate shares your views.
</p>

<p>
Since Pennsylvania doesn't allow voters registered as Non-Partisan to vote in any party's primary, I now have to make the decision whether it's worth re-registering as a Democrat to get a chance to vote. Given that the guy I'd probably vote for has no chance of winning, it might be moot... but if my vote keeps the race ambiguous for just a few days longer, it might be worth it. I don't think it's fair that a frontrunner gets annointed before half the states get a chance to voice their opinions, and I don't think it's necessary to jump on a bandwagon. Would a fight over the nomination at the Democratic Convention be a bad thing? On the contrary, I believe a nomination that isn't a foregone conclusion could revive interest in party conventions, and possibly encourage more people to vote.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Baking Up a Storm</h3>

<p>
Now that we have a <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/main/archives/cat_kitchen_remodel.html" target="a8_win">functional kitchen</a>, I've been cooking and baking like crazy. I've been testing out several muffin and coffeecake recipes on Al (and on my parents, who visited this past weekend), as well as making freezable meals like quiche and baked ziti. (The more we eat in, the longer I can afford not to work!)
</p>

<p>
I've never really been able to bake so frequently before, so I now have an opportunity to really test recipes&#8212;to determine what difference sifting makes, if any (so far, it seems to make for a lighter, less hockey-puckish muffin), whether futzing with the quantities of butter and oil change the taste markedly, and whether substituting buttermilk for half the milk in a coffecake makes it taste better or worse. All of these things may be obvious to good cooks, but they're less so to me, and I'm having a ball discovering well-trampled territory. I hope to be able to make up my own recipes before long.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Beer Babe</h3>

<p>
A couple weeks ago, as Al and I were watching SNL's Weekend Update on TiVo, Tina Fey made a joke about something that's been on my mind for years (and that I wrote a little rant about back in 1991): that the message Super Bowl ads send to us is that "girls are sluts for beer." (Of course, it's not just ads run during the Super Bowl&#8212;beer ads run year-round have this message.) Note that Tina made this joke *before* all the brouhaha over Janet's right breast. At the time, I exclaimed, "THANK YOU!" and mentioned the little rant &#8212;and the incident that precipitated it&#8212;to Al.
</p>

<p>
A couple days ago, while cleaning out some old files, I found the rant, written back in the days before blogs (before the web, even), when I was 23 and living in Arlington, VA. I'm glad I wrote it down, even if the only thing I could do with it at the time was put it in a file drawer. Apologies in advance for the stilted style and shifting verb tenses.
</p>

<div class="quoted">
<p>
I think I have always found the average beer commercial slightly irritating. Young men bring out the beer, and sexy, scantily-clad females come out of the woodwork to join the party. Beer, the commercials would have us believe, is to women what the bell was to Pavlov's dog: Tap the keg, and large-chested women pop up, drooling. </p>

<p>
Disgusting, stupid, and degrading, maybe, but only slightly irritating because I couldn't imagine that anyone could take these commercials seriously. I realize sex is used to sell everything these days... and until last Thursday, I believed the guys these ads were targeted at realized it too. 
</p>

<p>
On Thanksgiving Day, I decided to go see a movie. The theater is just down the street, so I walked. As I was passing through the parking lot of the public park behind my building, I came upon a group of young males gathered around a car with the stereo blaring. One of them saw me coming, and alerted his buddies.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, want a beer?" a tall guy with sunglasses and a bandana around his head offered as I drew closer.
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you," I said politely, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, I'll get you a cup.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;No, thanks.&quot; I kept walking.
</p>

<p>
&quot;Hey,&quot; he shouted after me, &quot;It's Thanksgiving Day, honey!&quot; I kept walking. &quot;I've got a frigging keg here! Help me out!&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;Man,&quot; another guy muttered, loudly enough for me to hear, &quot;She won't even take free beer!&quot;
</p>

<p>
I couldn't believe it. Did they think the fact that they had a keg with them made them more attractive? Did they think I was a Beer Bimbo, that I would come running when they waved a tap in front of my face? If I had trotted toward them in a bikini, my heaving chest nearly bouncing off my chin and my long blond hair flowing out behind me, with sweat and sand clinging to my body in all the right places, I could have understood their mistake. Instead, I was marching purposefully toward the theater, dressed all in black, wearing a leather biker jacket and giant Herman Munster shoes. My hair, rather than being long and flowing, was Marine Corps short. I might have been mistaken for the Terminator, but a Beer Bimbo? Never.
</p>

<p>
And yet these guys were absolutely incredulous that I could so blithely turn down their company&#8212;and worse, their free beer. Could these guys have taken seriously the message that the beer commercials purvey? It seems that not only had they taken this message seriously&#8212;they'd bought it hook, line, and sinker. Not want free beer? She must not be normal.
</p>

<p>
&quot;Hey, moose girl, where you going?&quot; yet another young male shouted after me.
</p>

<p>
&quot;Come on, bitch! It's free beer!&quot;
</p>

<p>
I walked faster, a little frightened&#8212;and a little startled by how fast an invitation had turned to abuse. Scarier still is that while these young men seem to have gotten the message the beer companies are sending, they've failed to get a more important message&#8212;one that has been showing up in news articles, TV dramas, movies, courtrooms... in short, *between* the commercials&#8212;that No, no matter how politely uttered, *still* means No. 
</p>

<h3 class="title">A Visit to Cancerland</h3>

<p>
Breast Cancer Action sent me this article, <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m1111/1818_303/79665310/p1/article.jhtml" target="a8_win">Welcome to Cancerland</a> (also available as a <a href="http://www.bcaction.org/Pages/GetInformed/HarpersArticle.html" target="a8_win">PDF</a>), a while back... possibly years back. I found it in a box of Truckee stuff, recognized <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805063897/" target="a8_win">Barbara Ehrenreich</a>'s name, and sat down to read it.
</p>

<p>
Much of what I read I already knew, but Barbara really puts it together. I found her insights about the infantilization of breast cancer and the positive-only focus on survivorhood particularly interesting, and although I knew that chemotherapy extends the average patient's life by only days or weeks, I didn't really understand the story behind that statistic. It's summed up in this paragraph:
</p>

<blockquote>
Even if foolproof methods for early detection existed, they would, at the present time, serve only as portals to treatments offering dubious protection and considerable collateral damage. Some women diagnosed with breast cancer will live long enough to die of something else, and some of these lucky ones will indeed owe their longevity to a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and/or anti-estrogen drugs such as tamoxifen. Others, though, would have lived untreated or with surgical excision alone, either because their cancers were slow-growing or because their bodies' own defenses were successful. Still others will die of the disease no matter what heroic, cell-destroying therapies are applied. The trouble is, we do not have the means to distinguish between these three groups. So for many of the thousands of women who are diagnosed each year, Plotkin notes, "the sole effect of early detection has been to stretch out the time in which the woman bears the knowledge of her condition." These women do not live longer than they might have without any medical intervention, but more of the time they do live is overshadowed with the threat of death and wasted in debilitating treatments.
</blockquote>

<p>
It's a long but fascinating article, highly recommended. (Breast Cancer Action's <a href="http://www.bcaction.org/Pages/LearnAboutUs/BreastCancerScreening.html" target="a8_win">Policy on Breast Cancer Screening and "Early Detection"</a> has more information on the value of early detection and is shorter, if you just want the facts without the editorial insights.) I'd meant to mention it here before, but I got caught up in other things. It came to mind again today because of a NY Times article about the approval of a new drug for colorectal cancer ("<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/27/business/27drug.html?th" target="a8_win">F.D.A. Approves Cancer Drug From Genentech</a>" -- free subscription required to view article), which contained this paragraph:
</p>

<blockquote>
The drug, approved for patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to other organs, is far from a cure. But in a clinical trial in which it was used with chemotherapy, people who received the drug lived a median of 20.3 months, almost five months longer than those who received only chemotherapy.
</blockquote>

<p>
Five months longer, at a total cost of $89,320 for the new drug alone ($4,400 x 20.3 months). This doesn't include the costs of chemotherapy (which include vomiting, hair loss, exhaustion, loss of libido, and other side effects, in addition to dollars). I'm just saying.
</p>
