</div>

 One of the resolutions I didn't write down but made in my head this year was to generate less trash. We've already started bringing our own bowls to Tampopo (where they give a $.50 discount for doing so) whenever possible, and I decline plastic utensils, paper napkins, and condiment packets whenever I intend to bring food home to eat, but I've still been piling up a ton of plastic and paper just from one regular habit: Getting coffee at...

 kottke.org has an interesting link today to a life-cycle energy analysis of reusable and disposable cups.
