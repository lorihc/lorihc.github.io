<h3 class="title">And Now a Word on Eating</h3>

<p>
Funny where you get when you hop around the web. I started at <a href="http://www.loobylu.com/" target="a8_win">Loobylu</a> this morning, then jumped from there to <a href="http://www.frenchtoastgirl.com/weblog/blogger.shtml" target="a8_win">French Toast Girl</a>, where I saw a link to <a href="http://iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=5&art_id=ct2003031620212555L130494&set_id=9" target="a8_win">a diet that involved eating everything with chopsticks</a>. The description of it reminded me of a book I read back in the mid-90s called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449003825/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Overcoming Overeating</a>. I totally understood the principles, but it was really hard to let go and surround myself with food, to trust that eventually I'd stop wanting to eat everything if I realized I could have whatever I wanted whenever I wanted it.

<p>
Lately I've been following a modified <a href="http://www.atkinscenter.com/" target="a8_win">Atkins</a> plan. I didn't start with Induction (where you eat as much meat as you want and only 3 cups of salad greens a day for at least two weeks) because I only have about 10 pounds to lose, and because Induction is difficult for a semi-vegetarian (I eat fish). I lost about 4 pounds at first, but lately I've been bouncing around in that 4-pound range. Some days at the top, where I started, and some days closer to the bottom. So for weight loss, apparently I have to be more diligent about counting my carbs. The best thing about this plan is that I've managed to kick my addiction to candy and baked goods. I don't worry too much about small amounts of sugar in my foods, and I eat diabetic-friendly chocolate (sweetened with maltitol or sucralose), but I've cut out the overt sugars that used to make up the majority of my daily calorie intake.
</p>

<p>
Getting rid of sugar is great, but I've never really been able to get a grip on eating normal quantities of food. I like to eat things one-after-the-other too much. It seems almost impossible for me *not* to eat while I'm working, too. It's something to do when I'm stuck. I'm not sure that chopsticks will slow me down all that much, either, since I'm fairly proficient with them (Al's Korean relatives were impressed; they had been prepared to offer me a fork until they saw me tackle my sushi and soba noodles like a native). I've tried banning food from my cube, but that goes out the window during crunch times.
</p>

<p>
The trick for me really is determining whether I'm hungry, or whether I'm just bored or frustrated. Since I've been bored or frustrated most of the time since age 6&#8212;but rarely truly hungry&#8212;is it any wonder that I can't tell the difference?

<h3 class="title">Another Sweeping Generalization</h3>

<p>
I've been doing some research lately. I've come up with a hypothesis that I'm trying to verify&#8212;entirely through anecdotal evidence, which isn't very scientific, I know. However, it's all I've got right now. Here's the hypothesis:
</p>

<p>
Women baristas make better lattes than men.
</p>

<p>
I had noticed that sometimes I got really excellent lattes (creamy, smooth, comforting), and other times, they sucked (bitter, sour, scorched, unsatisfying). I thought about who had served me the good ones and who had served me the bad ones, and I came up with a commonality: women were behind the former, and men the latter. I think men tend to overheat the milk (regardless of the kind&#8212;whole, skim, soy).
</p>

<p>
I've been putting this hypothesis to the test, and so far it's holding up. The smoothness of the espresso varies and does not seem to be related to the gender of the barista, but men definitely seem to have their thermostats set permanently on extra-hot, and women lean toward "drinkable now." (This penchant for non-tongue-burning temperatures can be taken to undesirable extremes: I recently got a short decaf latte that could be called lukewarm at best. And yes, I got it from a female barista.)
</p>

<p>
Because the smoothness of the espresso varies, it's important to get the temperature of the milk just right. Well-steamed milk can even out a bitter shot, and it can make a smooth one sublime&#8212;the ultimate comforting beverage. Scorched milk can make even a smooth shot taste icky.
</p>

<p>
If I come up with further evidence to support my hypothesis, or&#8212;as is not entirely unlikely&#8212;I become obsessive and start cataloging various short decaf latte experiences in a database, I'll follow up. In the meantime, I'll be smiling whenever I see a chick behind the steamer at Starbucks.
</p>
