<h3 class="title">The Dirt</h3>

<p>
I took a photo of all my seed packets today, I did! I just can't be bothered to edit and post it right now (it's late, other things to do, yadda yadda yadda). Instead I give you my Polaroid from Tuesday, which is actually apropos of what I did today: namely, turn the dirt in most of these containers.

Al has class on Thursday nights, so I'm always looking for something to do with the Beaner. He was enthusiastic about helping me plant tomato and pepper seeds, but lost interest about a third of the way through. He did participate in the turning of the soil in several pots, the clearing out of the giant garbage bin of tomato soil (I'm trying to keep the tomato soil separate from the non-tomato soil, but I think I've now managed to lose track of what's what, thanks to a shortage of vessels for the emptying of the garbage bin), and the turning of several bins of compost. He even brought his little Diego table and chair out to the deck so he could eat dinner out there with me (he not only carried the table and chair out himself, he also got his own dinner&#8212;rice pasta and yogurt).

We had a lovely time gardening in the twilight (and finally in darkness, by camp light and flaky deck light) while a neighbor across 21st Street serenaded us with a continuous loop of John Denver's Rocky Mountain High. Nice.
