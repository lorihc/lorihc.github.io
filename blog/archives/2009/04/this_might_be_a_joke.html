<p>
I finally cleaned out my Inboxes last night after being in California for about 10 days, and I came across the April NaBloPoMo  e-mail. The theme is GROWING (UP), which kind of makes sense for April; by this time last year, I had several seedlings well on their way. This year I've yet to plant anything (yes, I know, I'm way behind in gardening as in many other things), but I PLAN TO. So I gave some thought to participating in NaBloPoMo for April.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure I'll be able to do it&#8212;lately I've been posting every 3-4 weeks, it seems&#8212;but it's worth a try. I do have a garden to get into the ground (or into containers, I should say), and I do have a 4 year-old who's growing up fast, and I probably have a story or two about growing up myself that I could share (maybe). To get things started, here's <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2003/03/april_approache.html">a story from the archives about why I hate April 1st</a>.
</p>

<p>
Photos of seeds tomorrow, if I remember.
