<h3 class="title">Tackling the To-Do List</h3>

<p>
I plan to continue the Disney thread in a bit (in fact, it's item #1 on my to-do list), but before I do I wanted to elaborate on a tweet I just made:
</p>
<blockquote>
Why does unemployment = being busier than ever? Maybe because I'm trying to tackle my to-do list instead of treating it as a lost cause.<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller"><a href="http://twitter.com/WWLoriHC">WWLoriHC</a> Thu 25 Jun 10:41 via TweetDeck</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
My to-do list is lengthy. It includes things that I often got to while I was working, such as uploading photos to Flickr (*taking* photos isn't on the list because TRY AND STOP ME) and, less often, blogging, as well as things that Al and I would occasionally schedule in an attempt to knock them off, such as cleaning out a closet, doing household chores, or posting an item on freecycle or craigslist.
</p>

<p>
It's the items I never really had any hope of getting to, however, that are overwhelming me now&#8212;because on becoming unemployed, I had the illusion that YES! Now I'll finally be able to [insert long-languishing to-do item here]. (Suddenly the Beaner's Mad Libs Jr. books, with their lists of suggested nouns, verbs, and adjectives, come to mind.)
</p>

<p>
Of course, as anyone who's ever looked for a job before knows, it can be, if not a full-time gig in itself, at least a part-time one. That leaves between 10 and 20 hours a week for Flickr, blogging, reading blogs/news/Twitter, and the rest of the to-do list. I'm trying not to find the list so daunting as to write it off as a lost cause again, and I'm also trying not to be overambitious. One item at a time.
</p>

<p>
At the risk of not just seeming, but actually being, dorky, I'm going to publish my to-do list in the sidebar. I'm hoping it will encourage me to cross things off. (I won't include the things I usually get to daily or weekly, but rather the things I've been <em>meaning</em> to get to for weeks or months.)
</p>

<p>
Once I've done that, I'll get to the Disney post... and then one of the items on the list.
</p>
