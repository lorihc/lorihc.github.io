<h3 class="title">Wednesday (Not Saturday)</h3>

<p>
Again I'm going to start this entry with mention of my fame (!), as I neglected to mention the conversation that followed the "I read your blog!" sighting last Sunday. Al suggested that it might be he and the Beaner that made me recognizable, and I think for the most part he's right. I have certainly been recognized on my own before, especially when my hair is pink or purple, but I think it's when people see all three of us together that they have that, "hey, I know you!" moment.
</p>

Cute, and memorable, husband and child: I owe them my fame.
</p>

<p>
Now on to work, or lack thereof, or something like that. I actually have plenty to do, both online and off, at Indy Hall and at home, but on Monday I was very nearly paralyzed by guilt into doing nothing. Ironically, the guilt had to do with doing nothing: I felt guilty that I had the freedom to do pretty much what I wanted, when I wanted, when Al had to work. It didn't seem fair. And so I started feeling kind of sad.
</p>

<p>
Luckily Al sent me an e-mail that cheered me enough to get out of the house, because the weather was a BEAUTIFUL on Monday: about 70 degrees and Northern California dry. I took a couple (well, four, counting my iPhone) cameras with me and headed back out to University City on the #13 trolley.
</p>

<p>
I spent the next few hours walking around the Penn Alexander catchment area, taking photos of interesting signs, blooming flowers, and houses; talking to a lovely woman named Joya who was doing some square-foot gardening in her front yard; and getting a feel for the neighborhood. It was thoroughly lovely. I haven't finished the roll in the Minolta yet (and it's black and white, which won't give you the flavor of the day, which was incredibly colorful, anyway), but here are a few of the snaps I took with the other cameras:

</p>

<p>
The next day I woke up convinced it was Friday. That's when I realized that Monday's mini-depression was not a fluke: This not-working thing is definitely messing with my head.
</p>

<p>
This morning I woke up thinking it was Saturday, which I guess is at least consistent with thinking yesterday was Friday. Within a few hours I was also thinking that maybe I should tell the Beaner that I'd lost my job.
</p>

<p>
I hadn't told him yet because [a] I didn't want to freak him out, but more importantly, [b] I didn't want him to get his hopes up that this would mean I'd be staying home with him. (Did I already say this the other day? I can't remember.)  I fully intend to get another job, and I figured if things just went on as they had done while I was looking, there'd be little disruption in his life. 
</p>

<p>
The problem is that I started, almost immediately, wanting to spend more time with the Beaner. Looking for work is indeed a full-time gig, but but it's more like a 35-hour full-time gig, not a 45-hour full-time gig. There's at least an extra hour or two a day that I could be spending with the Beaner, even when my sort-of vacation/sort-of project time is over.
</p>

<p>
So tonight, I told him. The first thing he said was, "does that mean you're going to work upstairs again now?!", with an excited grin. (He associates me going to Indy Hall with me going to "work," which is probably a good thing.) He was a little confused about where exactly my job went and why; "the company did a bit of restructuring" doesn't mean much to a 4 year-old, so I explained further that they wanted to move in a new direction, and that they didn't need me to do it. I told him that I'd be looking for another job with a company that *does* need my services, and that I was confident I would find one.
</p>

<p>
He then asked why I was calling it a "job" when he knew it as "work". I said that he does work at school, and mommy and daddy do their work at their jobs. I'm not sure he got that one. I think he did understand that I'd still be going to Indy Hall while I'm looking for a job, but that I'd also be around a little more than usual, and that I was looking forward to spending that little extra time with him. He said he was, too.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure there will be further consequences/questions, but for now I think that went as well as can be expected. If I can just wake up tomorrow knowing it's Thursday, all will be right with the world.
</p>

<h3 class="title">YO!!</h3>

<p>
On Sunday I Twittered the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
The Beaner drew a picture, then took a photo of it, showed it to me, and said, "look! It's me saying 'YO'!" Will post later. :-)<br />
<span style="font-size:smaller;color:#999">10:57 AM Jun 6th from Tweetie </span>

<p>
Here's the promised photo:

There are two exclamation points in the title of this post because I noticed that there are two in the drawing. (He's ALL about the exclamation points these days&#8212;definitely of the Chaucer school of "more is more.")

<h3 class="title">Hey Now, You're an All-Star</h3>

<p>
I have such a backlog things to write about that I kind of wish I'd brought my laptop with me on vacation and blogged daily. Instead I'm playing vacation catch-up, still uploading photos from the Beaner's and my trip to Disney World and Al's and my trip to Annapolis, and I haven't even begun the writing yet. Well, I guess technically I have now.
</p>


<p>
I have lots of favorite photos and stories from the trip, but this photo is perhaps my favorite of all:
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3610974626/" title="Disney's All-Star Movies at Disney World! by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2358/3610974626_d3b5989c3c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Disney's All-Star Movies at Disney World!" /></a>
</p>

<p>
It's a self-portrait taken just after we arrived at our hotel&#8212;Disney's All-Star Movies Resort&#8212;on Tuesday morning, June 9. I've stayed at Movies before by myself (in 1999?), and at Sports three times (once with Sandra, once with Al on our honeymoon, and last year when we took the Beaner to Disney for the first time). I like the budget All-Star resorts, which offer a full measure of Disney whimsy for a very reasonable price, but they're starting to show their age a bit, and the housekeeping has gotten more and more spotty each time we've stayed. Example: At around 5pm on our second day (i.e., after our first night's stay), we returned to our room to find that the housekeeper had made my bed with the extra pillow in the center, making it look like it was pregnant. And it looked like she'd been interrupted in the process, because the coverlet was pulled up and tucked in on one side, but not the other.
</p>

<p>
The Beaner had just spotted the bottle of spray cleaner and the travel-size bottle of shampoo (I'd *thought* there was usually shampoo in the room in addition to soap!) on top of the TV when there was a knock at the door. It was the housekeeping supervisor, who'd come to make sure that our room had been serviced, because the housekeeper hadn't punched it in. "Um, sort of," I said. She looked at me quizzically, so I waved an arm toward the bed. I knew her first thought was, "ok, so you pulled the covers down...," so I explained that we'd just returned to find the bed like this. "And I suppose you'll want your spray cleaner back," I said. She was very friendly and apologetic, and said that she'd speak with the housekeeper. I told her it wasn't a big deal, and we wouldn't have mentioned it if she hadn't asked.
</p>

<p>
I didn't think much of it until our last day, when we finally got pool towels in our room (we'd been going to the front desk to request them)&#8212;but no hand towels or washcloths. We also got a new liner bag for the ice bucket, plus two mosquitoes floating in the melted water from the day before... and cups. Every day, we got a new stack of cups. It was the one thing we could absolutely count on, even though I don't think we used a single cup during our whole stay. There were so many of them that we were constantly knocking them off the sink.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3651936841/" title="the case of the multiplying cups by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3337/3651936841_db1dcd125d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="the case of the multiplying cups" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I'm thinking that a room-cleaning checklist is probably in order (and I say this knowing very well that there must be one): Shampoo, check. Soap, check. Bath, pool, and hand towels, check. Washcloths, check. Ice bucket emptied, used liner discarded, new liner provided, check. Mildew removed from around robe hook, check. Bed that doesn't look like it swallowed a watermelon, check. And so on.
</p>

<p>
Remind me to tell you about the really great parts of the All-Star Movies resort in the next post, including the pool, the front desk staff, and the wonderfully helpful food court manager, Erick.

<h3 class="title">Tackling the To-Do List</h3>

<p>
I plan to continue the Disney thread in a bit (in fact, it's item #1 on my to-do list), but before I do I wanted to elaborate on a tweet I just made:
</p>

<blockquote>
Why does unemployment = being busier than ever? Maybe because I'm trying to tackle my to-do list instead of treating it as a lost cause.<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller"><a href="http://twitter.com/WWLoriHC">WWLoriHC</a> Thu 25 Jun 10:41 via TweetDeck</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
My to-do list is lengthy. It includes things that I often got to while I was working, such as uploading photos to Flickr (*taking* photos isn't on the list because TRY AND STOP ME) and, less often, blogging, as well as things that Al and I would occasionally schedule in an attempt to knock them off, such as cleaning out a closet, doing household chores, or posting an item on freecycle or craigslist.
</p>

<p>
It's the items I never really had any hope of getting to, however, that are overwhelming me now&#8212;because on becoming unemployed, I had the illusion that YES! Now I'll finally be able to [insert long-languishing to-do item here]. (Suddenly the Beaner's Mad Libs Jr. books, with their lists of suggested nouns, verbs, and adjectives, come to mind.)
</p>

<p>
Of course, as anyone who's ever looked for a job before knows, it can be, if not a full-time gig in itself, at least a part-time one. That leaves between 10 and 20 hours a week for Flickr, blogging, reading blogs/news/Twitter, and the rest of the to-do list. I'm trying not to find the list so daunting as to write it off as a lost cause again, and I'm also trying not to be overambitious. One item at a time.
</p>

<p>
At the risk of not just seeming, but actually being, dorky, I'm going to publish my to-do list in the sidebar. I'm hoping it will encourage me to cross things off. (I won't include the things I usually get to daily or weekly, but rather the things I've been <em>meaning</em> to get to for weeks or months.)
</p>

<p>
Once I've done that, I'll get to the Disney post... and then one of the items on the list.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Disney Day 1: Swimming and Suitcases and Sticky, Sweaty Sleep</h3>

<p>
So a bit more info on our trip to Disney: (1) It was meant to be shortish, so it wouldn't be too expensive, (2) the Beaner and I went by ourselves, and (3) again to save on expenses, we only got 2-day non-Park Hopper tickets for a 3-day stay.
</p>

<p>
I made meal reservations before leaving Philadelphia (and about 8 weeks in advance, before I'd started eating a largely raw diet), and since two of the restaurants I knew I wanted to eat at were in the parks, it was pretty easy to figure out our park schedule once the dining reservations were in place. 
</p>

<p>
Our plan was to arrive around 9:30am on Tuesday, have our main suitcase brought to our hotel room by the Disney's Magical Express service, spend the day swimming, shopping, mini-golfing, and then have dinner at the Cape May Cafe over at the Beach Club resort. We'd purposely used the Beaner's Lightning McQueen suitcase as our carry-on and filled it with swimsuits, sunscreen, medications, and toiletries. (I remember well when Lightning was lost by the airline last year and arrived a day late, and I wanted to make sure we could brush or teeth and stay on our meds if the luggage disappeared again.)
</p>

<p>
When we checked in we were told that we'd be in Love Bug 7, and that I'd receive a call on my cell phone when our room was ready. (Technically checkin is at 3pm, but sometimes rooms are ready before that.)
</p>

<p>
Our first stop was the food court, where the Beaner got some oatmeal and an orange juice, and I ate a few of the nuts and dried fruit I'd brought in my backpack. Next we went outside to inspect a life-size model of the RC car from Toy Story, and then we visited the playground. The Beaner didn't stay as long as he normally would because there were no other kids to play with (the playground, for him, is all about making new friends). After about 10 minutes we went to the bathrooms near the pool and changed into our swim suits.
</p>

<p>
We must've stayed in the pool for 2 hours at least; after about 10 minutes, I realized that no matter how much sunscreen I had on, without some kind of cover in addition to my hat, I was going to FRY. I ended up using one of our towels to cover my shoulders, back, and most of my arms. I didn't care that it got soaked in the process, making it useless as a drying mechanism&#8212;as long as I didn't end up with angry red patches like just about everyone else in the pool, I'd count myself lucky.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3610646329/" title="after an hour in the pool by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3565/3610646329_b1ef3d362f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="after an hour in the pool" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I finally convinced the Beaner that we should get out and have a snack (we ate crackers and fruit from my backpack), and we also dressed at that point. It was about 1:30, and I hadn't heard that our room was ready, so I checked Lightning at the bell stand, and we took a bus to Downtown Disney. (In retrospect, I should have asked at the front desk about the room; I'd really been hoping to drop off our bags and rest a bit before going anywhere else.)
</p>

<p>
The main reason for visiting Downtown Disney was to transfer to a bus that would take us to the Boardwalk area, where we'd be having dinner. The Boardwalk area is also where the Fantasia Gardens mini-golf is, and I thought the Beaner would want to play. He didn't, however, so we ended up staying at Downtown Disney for a while instead.
</p>

<p>
[At this point I should probably mention that it was HOT. Very hot. 92 degrees and humid hot. After a very chilly, rainy, April-like start to June in Philly, the heat was kind of a shock. This is why most of the photos you'll see from now on feature sweat and lots of it.]
</p>

<p>
I'd heard there was a LEGO store at DD, so we went in search of that. It turned out to be a very big hit, and we spent almost as much time there as we did at the pool.
</p>

</p>

<p>
There was a play area next to the outdoor LEGO brick pits, but a sign warned that the play equipment might be very hot, and it was right. We opted for a bit more fun with some Duplo-sized blocks, and then we walked back to the bus stop at around 3:30.
</p>

<p>
I was trying to decide, as we rode on the bus, whether to get off at the Swan/Dolphin and walk around the Boardwalk to the Beach Club, or whether to get off at the Beach Club itself. If we did the latter, we'd be very early for dinner, but the Beaner was looking floppy and tired. We'd gotten up at 4am to make our early flight, he had not slept on the plane, and as I mentioned, it was very hot. He made the decision easy for me by falling asleep on my lap.
</p>

<p>
The bus ride ended up taking an excruciating hour and 20 minutes. Do not ask me what took so long (I know that loading a scooter passenger&#8212;and the resultant malfunctioning door&#8212;was part of the delay, but I have no idea about the rest of it). Disney Dining always reminds you to allow at least 90 minutes of travel time if using the bus system to get to a meal reservation, and I certainly did leave that much time, but MAN&#8212;to actually be on a bus for 90 minutes, especially with a super-hot, sleeping kid stuck to you, absolutely sucks. (I was not the only one with a passed-out kid on me, btw.)
</p>

<p>
The bus stop was a couple hundred yards from the entrance to the hotel, and I carried the still-sleeping Beaner to the door, at which point he woke up. It was 4:50, and I still hadn't heard about our room. I tried to get the number to call to inquire from the front desk staff at the Beach Club, but they were extremely confused about what I was asking, where I was staying, and where to find the number. They ended up giving me the fax number of All-Star Movies, and I didn't go back to correct the problem. Instead I spotted a house phone on the wall and picked it up.
</p>

<p>
Our room was indeed ready, and I wondered for how long it had been, but I didn't ask. Instead I sat and enjoyed the air conditioning and called Al, to whom I'd been sending regular photo updates by iPhone, until the hostess started checking people in at the Cape May Cafe at 5pm. I gave our name and explained that we had a 6:05 reservation (which was a bit late for us, given the lengthy ride we'd have back to our hotel). We were seated at 5:30, right when the restaurant opened, praise Mickey.

[L] an all-yellow meal; [R] the Beaner hinted that he wanted one of these cups about 8 times before I asked the waiter to put one on our tab but to bring it to the table empty. The &quot;lite&quot; raspberry lemonade that was supposed to come in it was unsafe on three counts: artificial colors, flavors, and sweeteners. I filled the cup with the apple juice from the photo on the left instead.

I had several small plates of (cooked) mussels, but what I was truly grateful for were the salads. I had two servings of mixed melon and three huge plates of greens. I have to say, I'm enjoying the heck out of eating so many raw fruits and vegetables, and they're particularly refreshing in the summer heat.
</p>

<p>
We took our time over the meal and ended up leaving around the time I'd originally calculated we'd be done if we were seated at 6:05. We decided to take the first bus that came along, since all the parks are transportation hubs and would offer a ride back to our hotel. The first bus happened to be Downtown Disney, so we returned there and transferred back to All-Star Movies, where we finally shuffled back to our room.

Herbie's front end was across the way on building 6; both his headlights and his taillights lit up at night.
</p>

<p>
It was a long walk to the back of the resort from the bus stop, and at first I wondered why they'd put us back there when I knew I'd booked a preferred room (which usually means by the pool/main building). Then I remembered that I'd noted on our reservation that the Beaner loved Cars. I'd noted this because I wasn't sure if they'd added a Cars building since my last visit here, and I would've hated to hear the Beaner moan that he'd rather be in the Lightning McQueen building. Instead, I heard him ask questions about Herbie (whom he referred to as "she") over and over for three days straight. :-) He doesn't like the Herbie movies, but he really did enjoy being in the Herbie building.
</p>

<p>
I ended up getting the Beaner bathed and in bed only about 30 minutes behind our usual schedule, and he fell asleep quickly. I showered and set the alarm for 7am, and then I went to bed too. We had a reservation for breakfast at the Magic Kingdom on Wednesday, and I wanted to have time to go on a ride or two before breakfast if possible.
