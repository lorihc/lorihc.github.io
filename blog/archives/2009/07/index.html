<h3 class="title">The Fix the Thing Shop</h3>

<p>
I've got to remind myself to say "yes" and not "just as soon as I'm done [whatever]" when the Beaner asks me to play with him. It's so easy to do these days; all you really have to do is sit there while he gives you the setup and your lines (if any), look away when he says, "don't look!', watch when he says "watch!", and say your lines when cued. It's not necessary to come up with something to do most times, as he usually has some plan worked out. One morning when I could have used more sleep, he actually told me to lie on the floor and close my eyes while he worked on a surprise for me. Bonus.
</p>

<p>
Today he spent about 10 minutes taking everything out of the downstairs bathroom (aka his repair shop), and then he asked me to make him a sign that said "Fix The Thing Shop". He taped it on the door himself, and he hung the "Come In, We Are OPEN" sign that he'd made a few months ago on the knob. I was to knock on the door when the sign was turned to OPEN (it started at CLOSED) and bring my truck in for repair.

He then proceeded to fix it, using a special diagnostic tool that I recognized as our vacuum cleaner. Awesome.
