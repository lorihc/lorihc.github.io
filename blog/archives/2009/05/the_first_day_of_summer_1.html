<h3 class="title">The First Day of Summer</h3>

<p>
Yes, I know the actual first day of summer isn't for another month or so, but I feel like my summer's starting right now, today. [Edited to add: If you were looking for the explanation that I promised "later" in my last post, this is it.]
</p>
<p>
The company I was working for did a bit of restructuring recently, and in the process my position was eliminated. I found out last Monday, and Friday was my last day. A few things to get out of the way:
</p>

<ol>
<li>I am not sad.</li>
<li>I wish the company and the people who still work there well. There are no hard feelings at all.</li>
<li>It was a *really* hard decision to leave my wonderful former job to take this one (the one that was just eliminated), but I think it was a the right one. I learned a lot in the past 10 months, got to try several new things, and expanded my horizons&#8212;in other words, I met the goals of the job switch.</li>
</ol>

<p>
And now it feels a lot like school's just let out for the summer. The vacation I've desperately needed is at hand, and then I need to start working again and planning for the future. I'm actually going to do a bit of work first, then vacation, then start planning for the future (aka job hunting full time). On my to-do list for this week and next:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Update the <a href="http://www.philadelphiafreeze.org/">Freeze website</a> (it needs help, and I've been promising to help it forever).</li>
<li>Add sample code to <a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/OpenAjax_Metadata_Specification">OpenAjax Metadata Specification</a> (I'm continuing as co-chair of the IDE working group as an individual member).</li>
<li>Start poking through the <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/">Mozilla source code</a>. It's been a while since I've written anything in C++, and it'd be fun to get my hands dirty again.</li>
<li>Scan Polaroids I took this weekend in Hunter, NY.</li>
<li>Participate in end-of-year events at the Beaner's school.</li>
<li>Blog more, both here and on my <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">hockey site</a>.</li>
<li>Update resume.</li>
<li>Give serious thought to what I want to do next (not just what I *could* do, but what I *want* to do).</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm also going to read some books and do some gardening, but I'd do that anyway, employed or not. :-)
