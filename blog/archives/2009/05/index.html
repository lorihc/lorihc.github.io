<h3 class="title">Reflections of the Day</h3>

<p>
I'm entering a photo I took last month in this month's <a href="http://www.greeblemonkey.com/2009/05/may-greeblepix-contest.html">Greeblepix Contest</a> because the photo captures today really well. I'm looking into a puddle of possibilities, hoping to see blue skies.
</p>

<p>
I'll explain more later.

<h3 class="title">The First Day of Summer</h3>

<p>
Yes, I know the actual first day of summer isn't for another month or so, but I feel like my summer's starting right now, today. [Edited to add: If you were looking for the explanation that I promised "later" in my last post, this is it.]
</p>

<p>
The company I was working for did a bit of restructuring recently, and in the process my position was eliminated. I found out last Monday, and Friday was my last day. A few things to get out of the way:
</p>

<ol>
<li>I am not sad.</li>
<li>I wish the company and the people who still work there well. There are no hard feelings at all.</li>
<li>It was a *really* hard decision to leave my wonderful former job to take this one (the one that was just eliminated), but I think it was a the right one. I learned a lot in the past 10 months, got to try several new things, and expanded my horizons&#8212;in other words, I met the goals of the job switch.</li>
</ol>

<p>
And now it feels a lot like school's just let out for the summer. The vacation I've desperately needed is at hand, and then I need to start working again and planning for the future. I'm actually going to do a bit of work first, then vacation, then start planning for the future (aka job hunting full time). On my to-do list for this week and next:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Update the <a href="http://www.philadelphiafreeze.org/">Freeze website</a> (it needs help, and I've been promising to help it forever).</li>
<li>Add sample code to <a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/OpenAjax_Metadata_Specification">OpenAjax Metadata Specification</a> (I'm continuing as co-chair of the IDE working group as an individual member).</li>
<li>Start poking through the <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/">Mozilla source code</a>. It's been a while since I've written anything in C++, and it'd be fun to get my hands dirty again.</li>
<li>Scan Polaroids I took this weekend in Hunter, NY.</li>
<li>Participate in end-of-year events at the Beaner's school.</li>
<li>Blog more, both here and on my <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">hockey site</a>.</li>
<li>Update resume.</li>
<li>Give serious thought to what I want to do next (not just what I *could* do, but what I *want* to do).</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm also going to read some books and do some gardening, but I'd do that anyway, employed or not. :-)
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Beaner and the Baby</h3>

<p>
This past weekend we visited my grandmother in Hunter, NY, and while up there we also got to see my cousin Sarah's new baby, who was born on Thursday. The Beaner had a peek, didn't think she looked very interesting, and went to play outside.
</p>

</p>

<p>
More photos from Hunter/Windham to come, as soon as I scan the Polaroids (if I can scan the Polaroids; I finally traced the high-pitched squealing noise coming from my desk area to the scanner).

<h3 class="title">Sign, Sign, Everywhere a Sign</h3>

<p>
My mom used to say (or maybe she was quoting someone else, I'm not sure) that there are signs everywhere; you just have to notice them. You don't need tea leaves or tarot cards to give you some help in making a decision; a newspaper will do. Open the paper (or a book) to a random page, and poke your finger at it. You just might find the answer you're looking for. 
</p>


<p>
I remember when Al was trying to help a friend decide between taking a professorship at Harvard and one at Stanford. She had ties to Stanford, but the Harvard job was appealing, too. She was really torn. After a day of discussing it in depth, they went to the movies, where they talked about it a bit more while waiting for the film to start. A few college kids filed into the row in front of them and turned to look up for more of their friends, and the one who stopped right in front of Al's friend was wearing a shirt that said, "Harvard: The Right Choice."
</p>

<p>
On the walk home on the day I got laid off, two strangers on separate blocks said &quot;hi!&quot; as I passed, like I'd startled them with my own greeting (though I hadn't). Then, as I was walking down Arch Street, a man walked out of a bar for a cigarette, looked me right in the eye, and said, &quot;FUCK YEAH! IT'S THE RIGHT FUCKING TIME!&quot;
</p>
<p>
I smiled at him and thought to myself, why yes, yes it is.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Recent Conversations with the Beaner</h3>

<p>
Before I get to a couple conversations I've had with the Beaner over that past few days and weeks, I wanted to acknowledge the woman who said out a car window in the parking lot of the Supreme Food Market in University City today, "I read your blog!"
</p>


<p>
I was startled but rather pleased; it's only happened to me a couple times before, and not for a long time. If you were the person who made my day, please say hi in the comments! :-)
</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I wish I'd written the date on the notes I jotted down after these two conversations, which happened on the same day, but I didn't. I'm going to guess that they happened in mid-late April.
</p>

<p>
We were walking to Whole Foods, and as we passed the old Please Touch Museum building, the Beaner asked who would be moving in there. I said I didn't know.
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "Maybe I will."
</p>

<p>
Me: "Oh yeah? You mean when you're older?"
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "Yeah, because I'll need something big&#8212;bigger than our house. I don't know how many kids I'm going to have, so I'll need as much space as possible. I won't need to buy a car, though; I'll design and build that myself."
</p>

<p>
Later, over dinner, we got talking about his name, and how he's named after my favorite author.
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "Maybe I'll be an author, too!"
</p>

<p>
Me: "Sure, why not?"
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "What's an author?"
</p>

<p>
Me: "Someone who writes books."
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "Oh."
</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p id="explanation">
Yesterday morning, the Beaner and I sat in the kitchen, looking through the work in his Friday Folder. This picture was inside:
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3583801052/" title="chin and nose by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2467/3583801052_af6ca21113_o.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="chin and nose" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "This is me, and this is Ms. Pysher saying that I behaved well on the play deck." [The picture was drawn on Thursday, which was a VERY BAD DAY for him in the morning; I wrote a post about it, but I never hit publish. It was too angry, and as I usually do when I write angry e-mails, I just saved it as a draft and never let anyone else see it. In any case, he had a better afternoon, and his teacher praised him for it. The text below the picture says. "Hmmmmmmm. OH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and represents him thinking, and then realizing what he'd done wrong.]
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "See how many exclamation points I used? I would have used more&#8212;maybe a million!&#8212;but I ran out of room."
</p>

<p>
Me: "What are these, teeth?"
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "No, those are just lines on my chin. [I think he was trying to capture the creases.] And I drew the nose this way because that's how noses are in real life. See? [pointing to the picture and then his own nose] Nozzles."
</p>

<p>
Me: "Nostrils."
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "Right, nostrils."
</p>

<p>
And then we both burst out laughing.
</p>
