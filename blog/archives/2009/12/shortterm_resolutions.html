<h3 class="title">Short-Term Resolutions</h3>

<p>
It's not quite New Year's yet, but I already have a couple resolutions that I want to make. One is to spend the three days that I have off this weekend taking photos. It's been too long since I've just walked around, looking for the beauty in everyday things. And the women at the Walgreens photo counter are starting to miss me and my negatives only + CD orders, too.
</p>

<p>
The other thing I'm resolving to do is blog every day in January. I want to spend a little time taking stock, and all the year-end and decade-end "best" lists around have gotten me thinking about the books, movies, TV shows, and experiences I've enjoyed most over the past few years. Coincidentally, the <a href="http://www.nablopomo.com/" target="_blank">NaBloPoMo</a> theme for January is BEST, so I've submitted my site to the blogroll and hope to stick with it.
</p>

<p>
See you all in a couple days. :-)

<p>Happy (early) New Year, Lori! Look forward to reading you daily in January (maybe some hockey stuff in that BEST too?). :)</p>
