<p>
The Beaner's been talking a lot lately about getting a little sister. (He projects with his Mickey and Minnie dolls; Mickey&#8212;or the Beaner&#8212;is the big brother, and Minnie is the little sister.)
</p>
<p>
This morning he crawled into bed with us for a cuddle, and he mentioned it again.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beaner: </b>If I ever get a little sister, you could name her Jane, like you wanted.
</p>

<p>
<b>Me: </b>Or [name a] or [name b], more likely.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beaner: </b>Yeah, you should have a girl, so you can use one of those names.
</p>

<p>
<b>Me: </b>Well, Daddy and I did consider adopting another child, but we decided that we'd prefer to have just you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beaner: </b>I think if you can, it's better to have one the automatic way.
</p>

<p>
Ironically, this is exactly what my doctor suggested when I first proposed adoption prior to getting pregnant with the Beaner&#8212;except she knew it wasn't necessarily automatic. :-)

<p>He is going to be so surprised.</p>

<p>Interestingly, he asked last week how babies get made. I tried to put him off, but he insisted, so I started with, "well, babies come from a sperm and an egg...," and then he head-butted me. End of discussion. It hasn't come up again since, but I know it will.</p>
