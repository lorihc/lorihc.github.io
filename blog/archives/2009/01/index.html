<h3 class="title">2009</h3>

<p>
I'm going to be brave and declare that 2009 will be:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The year I make my job what I want it to be, instead of just taking a job because it wants me.</li>
<li>The year I stop working from home.</li>
<li>The year I find myself by seeking out others.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Perhaps those don't sound very brave, but #2, in particular, was scary to write. I almost added that this would be the year I'd make 5 separate dinner invitations, but that seemed a little ambitious for someone who made 0 in 2008. I decided instead that it could be rolled into #3, and I'd just keep it in mind as a sub-goal.
</p>

<p>
Something else I plan to do in 2009: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157612061539194/">Take at least a photo a day, and post it on Flickr</a>. Yep, I'm doing a 365 project again, starting at the beginning of the year this time.
</p>

<p>
Wish me luck. And fortitude.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Unsolicited Review: Starbucks Twist-Top Reusable Mug</h3>

<p>
One of the resolutions I didn't write down but made in my head this year was to generate less trash. We've already started bringing our own bowls to Tampopo (where they give a $.50 discount for doing so) whenever possible, and I decline plastic utensils, paper napkins, and condiment packets whenever I intend to bring food home to eat, but I've still been piling up a ton of plastic and paper just from one regular habit: Getting coffee at Starbucks.
</p>

<p>
My favorite way to drink coffee (and especially tea) is from a ceramic mug. My second-favorite way to drink coffee is from those paper Starbucks cups with the Solo lids. (I should note that I *hate* to drink tea this way; the only thing worse than drinking tea from a paper cup with a Solo lid is drinking tea from a Styrofoam cup, lid or no lid.)
</p>

<p>
The reason both paper and mug are fine for coffee has to do with the way I sip and savor my coffee. I like a bit of creamy foam or whipped cream on top of my latte/au lait/light mocha; it lets me start the savoring process without scalding my tongue. Usually by the time the foam or whipped cream is gone, the coffee is at the perfect temperature for drinking (provided it was hot enough to begin with). Plus, I'm a fan of the creamy. Just the way it is.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3171121998/" title="for here by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3084/3171121998_892cb573a7.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="for here" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it's been so long since I used a travel mug that I'd forgotten *why* I hadn't used one in so long: namely, they generally provide crappy sipping experiences. (A secondary reason is that the travel mugs I own or admire are the wrong size, usually 16-20oz. when I need 8-12oz.) So with the secondary reason in mind and the primary reason long forgotten, I purchased an 8oz. travel mug with a twist top on Saturday.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3171125962/" title="8oz. twist-top travel mug by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1197/3171125962_08caa1dbd1.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="8oz. twist-top travel mug" /></a>
</p>

<p>
It came highly recommended by the barista, who said he loved his; it's a pretty color; the twist top is novel; it's the perfect size for a short latte. What's not to love? I found out on Sunday, when I got a short latte in it. The barista left a nice foamy top on the latte, which I had to sip down a bit in order to screw the top on. This turned out to be the only enjoyable moment of the latte-drinking experience, so I'm glad now for the overfill.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3171126722/" title="twist-top travel mug by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1014/3171126722_a0ffbca380.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="twist-top travel mug" /></a>
</p>

<p>
After screwing the top on and twisting it open, I tilted the mug to sipping position... and nothing happened. I tipped it up a bit more. Nothing. I tipped it a bit more...and promptly scalded the back of my tongue as a rush of steaming-hot latte hit it. I spent the entire walk home trying to figure out how to sip from the damn thing, but I never achieved anything other than a dump down the gullet. I finally took the top off and tossed it into the back of the Beaner's tricycle, but I only got two sips before the latte level dropped to the point where I had to stick my nose all the way into the cup and upend it&#8212;essentially dumping it down my gullet again.
</p>

<p>
By the time I arrived home, I was pretty pissed off&#8212;and the primary reason for avoiding travel mugs was once again fresh in my mind. Given that this mug was useless with its top on (and even then only until half-empty), I might as well have brought a ceramic mug from home... if only I'd had one the right size for a short. FART.
</p>

<p>
While purchasing this disappointing twist-top reusable mug, I'd spotted another option that was appealing because it looked just like the standard Starbucks cup, only plastic. (I guess my subconscious was trying to alert me to the sippability factor, but my conscious mind ruled this option out because of size.) It was on the sale table, being holiday-themed, and I considered buying it for Al. I wasn't sure it'd be his thing, though, so I passed.
</p>

<p>
After consulting him and discovering that it indeed would have been to his liking, and after having the disastrous drinking experience with the twist-top mug, I walked back to the Starbucks with the holiday-themed, cup-style travel mugs and bought two. I still say it's too big for my daily short latte (it's 16oz., which is grande size), but it's nice for taking a homemade hot chocolate in the car. I tested it at my desk this morning, and the sippability is roughly the same as with a standard Starbucks paper cup with Solo lid.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3171931196/" title="grande travel mug by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3080/3171931196_2409eb8eaf.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="grande travel mug" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I also got another 8oz. mug with a flip-up plug; it's not as sure a bet on the sippability front as the grande cup, but given the placement of the flow hole, I have hope. If it doesn't work out, I'll be sure to rant about it here. Oh, and I gave the green mug to the nanny, who said she'd try it for tea. It's my guess that she'll be passing it on after one try, too.

<h3 class="title">Out, Damn... What Is This, Anyway?</h3>

<p>
Via <a href="http://ratphooey.livejournal.com/">Ratphooey</a>: A LiveJournal group called <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/unclutter_2009/">unclutter_2009</a>, the motto of which is "Relieving ourselves of a thing a day, every day."
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure I could keep up with the posting of intake and outflow, nor am I certain I could come up with 365 things in my home that I don't need (or maybe I'm just scared that I could), but it occurs to me that along with my 365 photo project, it might be fun to start a Flickr set devoted to things I got rid of this year. I started photographing (and sometimes writing about; see the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/scrapbook/">scrapbook</a> category) things that I'd only been keeping for sentimental reasons before tossing them several years ago, but this would be for the random junk, not just the sentimental stuff.
</p>

<p>
I think I have a new project.

<h3 class="title">Morning Non-Routine</h3>

<p>
Just wanted to record something&#8212;I'm not sure whether to call it a development, so I'll just call it something that happened this week. On Monday morning, instead of coming down between 7 and 7:30, hopping in bed with us, and demanding a pillow, the Beaner bopped into the room at roughly 7:35 fully dressed.
</p>

<p>
On Tuesday, he did the same&#8212;right down to the clothes he'd been wearing on Monday. (I encouraged him to switch to one of the Joe sweaters I'd gotten him for Christmas instead.)
</p>

<p>
This morning I woke up shortly before my 7:30 alarm and thought I heard him moving around upstairs, but he didn't come down. I also heard the rain pouring down outside and decided not to brave the elements for a morning walk, instead making myself comfortable and dozing some more.
</p>

<p>
A little after 8am I heard Al get up and go to wake the Beaner. He came back down and said, "he was up there reading books." (Did I mention that he started reading basic stuff a few months ago, and that he's now on a full-on reading roll?) "Was he dressed?" I asked. No, Al replied, he was still in his jammies, but he was now in the process of getting dressed.
</p>

<p>
He came down wearing the same shirt as on Monday again (his ColumbiaKnit Steve shirt), this time with a Sharks hockey jersey (which he called an Eagles shirt, for some reason) underneath.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if any of these DIY morning activities will become routine, but they were a pleasant surprise this week. Can't wait to see what happens tomorrow.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Listening to the House</h3>

<p>
Remember how I said I was going to sorta-kinda participate in <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2009/01/out_damn_what_is_this_anyway.html">the great junk-ousting of 2009</a>? I did indeed start a Flickr set, which currently has one photo, a collage comprised of several small photos so as not to spam my Flickr stream with junk:
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3176826051/" title="out 01.06.2009 by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3331/3176826051_5ff1fd2f08.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="out 01.06.2009" /></a>
</p>

<p>
More interesting (to me, at least) than what I've thrown out so far is how my house seems to be telling me what the weeding project of the evening will be. I'm actually excited to get home tonight (I'm working at <a href="http://www.indyhall.org/">Indy Hall</a> today; more on that in another post, later) to see what the house will suggest.
</p>

<p>
The weeding pictured in the photo above was precipitated by a simple act: I wanted to put my new reusable mugs next to the basket holding my keys and other random stuff I take on my morning walks (film cameras, sunglasses, etc.). The basket was overflowing, leaving no room for the mugs. So I cleaned it out, removing expired coupons for film developing, coins that should have gone into the coin cup instead, random ribbons and receipts, a couple rubber bands, and a button about banned books that had fallen off an old backpack that Al uses more than I do these days.
</p>

<p>
I didn't want to throw out the button, so I moved it to the old "stroller station" in the storage room... and that's when the house Spoke To Me. 
</p>

<p>
It said, "What the F*&^ are you doing? What's so important about this button? And WHY DO YOU HAVE A STROLLER STATION WHEN YOU HAVE NO STROLLER?" I promptly set about cleaning out and dismantling the stroller station and photographing all the detritus I found while doing so, resulting in the photo above.
</p>

<p>
Last night's cleaning was precipitated by a similar event: I wanted my new This Is Not a Paper Cup (suggested by Shani in a <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2009/01/unsolicited_review_starbucks_twi.html#comments">recent comment</a>) with the other reusable mugs near the front door, but it didn't fit on the shelf with the others. I decided to clean off the top shelf, which had all kinds of random crap on it and was dusty to boot.
</p>

<p>
I removed the random crap, and then I dove under the kitchen sink in search of counter wipes to mop up the dust, vermiculite, and needles from <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2007/04/freak_accidentprone.html">the cactus that fell on me in 2007</a>. What I discovered was that the bottle of Clorox wipes was sitting in a container of fetid water that had apparently leaked from the garbage disposal at some point in the probably-not-so-recent past. And the house spoke: HERE'S TONIGHT'S PROJECT!
</p>

<p>
I ended up pulling everything out from under the kitchen sink and throwing away about a third of it, scrubbing and disinfecting the cabinet, cleaning off the garbage disposal unit, vacuuming the kitchen, and then mopping the floor (because I'd dripped some of the fetid goo on it) in addition to cleaning the shelf by the front door.
</p>

<p>
I didn't take any photos of what I threw out from under the sink (or of the cabinet), but I did take what I hope to be one of 52 weekly Polaroids&#8212;of the vacuum cleaner&#8212;after I'd finished the project. I'll scan and post it tonight or tomorrow, when I'm back in front of my scanner.
</p>

<p>
I'm seriously giddy thinking about what tonight's cleaning/weeding project will be... and I'll find out soon&#8212;my Go Home alarm just went off.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Passionate</h3>

<p>
Someone asked me recently, in a professional context, what I was passionate about. I know the answer that would have made the questioner most excited was probably "working on open-source software," or "changing the world with a single bugfix," or something along those lines, but what I said was, "honestly? Photography."
</p>

<p>
I probably should have clarified that it's not *simply* photography that I'm passionate about; it's the photography feedback loop that is Flickr. I've always loved taking photos (and working in both physical and virtual darkrooms), but Flickr has stoked my passion for photography the way the Law & Order Mailing List once stoked my passion for the television show of the same name.
</p>

<p>
I get inspired by other photographers on Flickr, I learn new techniques on Flickr, I try new cameras and film that I discover on Flickr. (I won't even get into the social aspects; suffice to say I've made several new friends, many of whom have pushed me with their own amazing work to make better photographs myself.)
</p>

<p>
All this to say that while I *am* passionate about work-related things&#8212;developing software that "just works" the way you want it to; learning about how different developers do their jobs; the forensic science-like work of bug fixing&#8212;if someone offered to pay me to spend my time however I wanted all day, I'd probably spend it taking, scanning, editing, and posting photographs to Flickr. Making cards, stickers, and giant prints out of them. Searching eBay for cameras and film. Thinking up new photography subjects and projects. Reviewing all my favorites from my contacts and from my own archives of years past.
</p>

<p>
Not that I don't do all these things anyway; I'd just do them all the time, instead of just when I can squeeze them in. That seems to me the very definition of a "passion".
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

This face is something else I'm passionate about.

<a id="002464"></a>
<h3 class="title">Yesterday</h3>

<p>
I don't think I've written here since my role changed at work (to something I wanted to do, that I think I'm naturally good at, and that was needed on the team). Since the change I've been busy with meetings and planning and process (and a trip to California for all three), and I can honestly say I've been having a great time. I just haven't made much time for blogging, as evidenced by the &quot;Yesterday vs. 2008&quot; Blog item in Things that's 6 days overdue. (I'm trialing Things on a friend's recommendation and rather liking it so far; it's handy that I can keep track of my Areas of Responsibility and all the items that fit in each area. I made Blog one of the areas so I could remember things I wanted to write about.)
</p>


<p>
I think it's especially important that I continue to blog about kid milestones as I get busier at work&#8212;without shortchanging the kid, of course. If I have to choose between spending time with the Beaner and blogging about him, I hope I know to choose Beaner time. (If that happens, I'll probably end up saving memories on little scraps of paper and blogging in bullet points, as I did on my trip to Korea back in 2003.) Looking over my parenthood archives with Al and the Beaner before my trip and watching all the videos I'd posted over the past 3 years or so brought home how easy it is to forget how things used to be. I barely recognized the kid in the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/movies/choo_choo.html">train video</a>, though I understand him better now than I did then. Perhaps there's some kind of 20/20 hindhearing when you've been a witness to the evolution of your child's speech?
</p>
<p>
When I later went to dig up (and then back up, when I realized that they weren't backed up) the videos I took in 2006 and 2007, I found even more moments that I only vaguely remembered. There were a few that I instantly recognized, even if I didn't remember recording them, and seeing those moments made me want to capture and chronicle more. So that's my long-winded way of saying that time is speeding up and I don't want to miss anything and THANK GOD FOR THE BLOG. (Even Al said THANK GOD FOR THE BLOG when we were reviewing the archives, and he's always been a somewhat reluctant supporter of my blogging habit.)
</p>
<p>
That brings us back to the &quot;Yesterday vs. 2008&quot; Things item, which has to do with the Beaner's recognition of the turning of the year. I know that they start Circle Time in his classroom each day by having one kid stand up and tell what day, month, date, year, and season it is, but I don't think he was really *aware* of the year until recently. He used to refer to the past as &quot;yesterday&quot; in virtually every situation; for example, &quot;Yesterday Grandma and Grandpa gave me a book for my birthday,&quot; when his birthday was a month ago. Yesterday was good for two days ago, last week, last month, six months ago, last year.
</p>
<p>
Now, suddenly, his favorite way of referring to the past is, &quot;that was in 2008!&quot; His first real nanny, Hannah, came to visit us last week after the Inauguration (which, now that I think of it, is probably what prompted all the nostalgic video watching), and we reminded the Beaner that Hannah was his nanny when he was little and has been his friend ever since. &quot;You mean she was my nanny in 2008?&quot; he asked. &quot;No, Aura and Shawna were your nannies in 2008,&quot; I told him. This is apparently a puzzler for him; just as nothing existed before yesterday for a long while, he's now unsure of what came before 2008.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of remembering, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3242886706/">do you remember the 21st night of September?</a>*
