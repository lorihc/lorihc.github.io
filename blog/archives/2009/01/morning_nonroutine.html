<h3 class="title">Morning Non-Routine</h3>

<p>
Just wanted to record something&#8212;I'm not sure whether to call it a development, so I'll just call it something that happened this week. On Monday morning, instead of coming down between 7 and 7:30, hopping in bed with us, and demanding a pillow, the Beaner bopped into the room at roughly 7:35 fully dressed.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, he did the same&#8212;right down to the clothes he'd been wearing on Monday. (I encouraged him to switch to one of the Joe sweaters I'd gotten him for Christmas instead.)
</p>

<p>
This morning I woke up shortly before my 7:30 alarm and thought I heard him moving around upstairs, but he didn't come down. I also heard the rain pouring down outside and decided not to brave the elements for a morning walk, instead making myself comfortable and dozing some more.
</p>

<p>
A little after 8am I heard Al get up and go to wake the Beaner. He came back down and said, "he was up there reading books." (Did I mention that he started reading basic stuff a few months ago, and that he's now on a full-on reading roll?) "Was he dressed?" I asked. No, Al replied, he was still in his jammies, but he was now in the process of getting dressed.
</p>

<p>
He came down wearing the same shirt as on Monday again (his ColumbiaKnit Steve shirt), this time with a Sharks hockey jersey (which he called an Eagles shirt, for some reason) underneath.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if any of these DIY morning activities will become routine, but they were a pleasant surprise this week. Can't wait to see what happens tomorrow.
