<h3 class="title">Out, Damn... What Is This, Anyway?</h3>

<p>
Via <a href="http://ratphooey.livejournal.com/">Ratphooey</a>: A LiveJournal group called <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/unclutter_2009/">unclutter_2009</a>, the motto of which is "Relieving ourselves of a thing a day, every day."
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure I could keep up with the posting of intake and outflow, nor am I certain I could come up with 365 things in my home that I don't need (or maybe I'm just scared that I could), but it occurs to me that along with my 365 photo project, it might be fun to start a Flickr set devoted to things I got rid of this year. I started photographing (and sometimes writing about; see the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/scrapbook/">scrapbook</a> category) things that I'd only been keeping for sentimental reasons before tossing them several years ago, but this would be for the random junk, not just the sentimental stuff.
</p>

<p>
I think I have a new project.

<p>You don't have to post regularly, though it can be helpful to those of us with lots to declutter - it keeps us honest.</p>

<p>Having been in your house (though not for a while), you may well not have that much to declutter.  :-)</p>
