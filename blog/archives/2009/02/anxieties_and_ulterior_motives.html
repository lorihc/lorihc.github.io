<h3 class="title">Anxieties and Ulterior Motives</h3>

<p>
This morning the Beaner came down about an hour earlier than he should have (I heard Al say, "your clock's not green yet"), but Al let him into our bed anyway. Both of us were too tired to force him back upstairs, and doing so would have meant waking up fully.
</p>
<p>
The Beaner went back to sleep after a bit of thrashing and whining about not getting enough covers, but at about 7am he shouted "DON'T GO!" and woke himself (and me) up. I saw him look around and then put his head back down and go back to sleep.
</p>

<p>
I finally dragged myself out of bed at 7:45 and then shook him awake and told him he needed to get dressed for school. While he was upstairs getting ready, I said to Al, "did you hear him shout 'DON'T GO!' at around 7am?" He had. "Well, at least we know what his main anxiety is." (I asked the Beaner what he'd dreamed about that he shouted, and he replied, "I don't want to tell you," but I can guess.)
</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Al had an early meeting this morning, so I walked the Beaner to school. As we neared Pete's he stopped me to ask “why is the Worcester sign out?” He repeated it like 3 times because I didn't understand what he was talking about. He finally pulled away and pointed to the unlit Budweiser sign in the Pete’s window. “Why is that one not lighted?” [He must have been saying “Weister”.] I said I didn’t know, and that we needed to hurry to school.
</p>

<p>
“And that’s my bus,” I added, noticing the 48 at the bus stop.
</p>

<p>
“Guess you’ll just have to work in the house today,” the Beaner said cheerfully.
</p>
