<h3 class="title">NaNa Shoes</h3>

<p>
I've had these shoes since the early 90s, and I've been extremely reluctant to part with them even though I only wear them about once a year now. They represent a time for me, a style, my personality in a pair of shoes. I still remember the time a woman asked me in an elevator, &quot;are those NaNa shoes?&quot; Why yes, yes they are. 
</p>

</p>

<p>
My friend Amy had a pair, and as soon as I saw them on her, I knew I had to have them, too. I wore them mostly with short skirts and black tights, sometimes to my job at the World Bank, sometimes to clubs. I wore them out and got them resoled. I can still hear the clunk and jingle of them.
</p>

<p>
I finally decided to let them go. I considered posting them on Craiglist or eBay, but instead I sent them with Al on his latest Goodwill run. I could picture some thrifty hipster coming across them and falling in love the way I did, and it made me smile.
