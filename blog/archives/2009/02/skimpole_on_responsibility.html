<h3 class="title">Skimpole on Responsibility</h3>

<p>
After a brief interlude in contemporary non-fiction (I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743576853?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0743576853">The Post-American World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=avocado8&l=as2&o=1&a=0743576853" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
&#8212;the audiobook is read by the author, who has both a compelling argument and a compelling voice), I've returned to the classics on my Audible wishlist. I've been listening to Dickens' <a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_BLAK_000506&BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">Bleak House</a>, and a passage from it that I heard today struck me as particularly apropos to our times.
</p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As they were to remain with us that day, and had taken their places to return by the coach next morning, I sought an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Skimpole. Our out-of-door life easily threw one in my way; and I delicately said, that there was a responsibility in encouraging Richard.
</p>

<p>
"Responsibility, my dear Miss Summerson?" he repeated, catching at the word with the pleasantest smile, "I am the last man in the world for such a thing. I never was responsible in my life —I can't be."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid everybody is obliged to be," said I, timidly enough: he being so much older and more clever than I.
</p>

<p>
"No, really?" said Mr. Skimpole, receiving this new light with a most agreeable jocularity of surprise. "But every man's not obliged to be solvent ? I am not. I never was. See, my dear Miss Summerson," he took a handful of loose silver and halfpence from his pocket, "there's so much money. I have not an idea how much. I have not the power of counting. Call it four and ninepence — call it four pound nine. They tell me I owe more than that. I dare say I do. I dare say I owe as much as good-natured people will let me owe. If they don't stop, why should I? There you have Harold Skimpole in little. If that's responsibility, I am responsible."
</p>

<p>
The perfect ease of manner with which he put the money up again, and looked at me with a smile on his refined face, as if he had been mentioning a curious little fact about somebody else, almost made me feel as if he really had nothing to do with it.
</p>
