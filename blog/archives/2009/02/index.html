<h3 class="title">Anxieties and Ulterior Motives</h3>

<p>
This morning the Beaner came down about an hour earlier than he should have (I heard Al say, "your clock's not green yet"), but Al let him into our bed anyway. Both of us were too tired to force him back upstairs, and doing so would have meant waking up fully.
</p>

<p>
The Beaner went back to sleep after a bit of thrashing and whining about not getting enough covers, but at about 7am he shouted "DON'T GO!" and woke himself (and me) up. I saw him look around and then put his head back down and go back to sleep.
</p>

<p>
I finally dragged myself out of bed at 7:45 and then shook him awake and told him he needed to get dressed for school. While he was upstairs getting ready, I said to Al, "did you hear him shout 'DON'T GO!' at around 7am?" He had. "Well, at least we know what his main anxiety is." (I asked the Beaner what he'd dreamed about that he shouted, and he replied, "I don't want to tell you," but I can guess.)
</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Al had an early meeting this morning, so I walked the Beaner to school. As we neared Pete's he stopped me to ask “why is the Worcester sign out?” He repeated it like 3 times because I didn't understand what he was talking about. He finally pulled away and pointed to the unlit Budweiser sign in the Pete’s window. “Why is that one not lighted?” [He must have been saying “Weister”.] I said I didn’t know, and that we needed to hurry to school.
</p>

<p>
“And that’s my bus,” I added, noticing the 48 at the bus stop.
</p>

<p>
“Guess you’ll just have to work in the house today,” the Beaner said cheerfully.
</p>

<h3 class="title">My Airplane</h3>

<p>
The other day we had a childcare emergency&#8212;nothing huge in the grand scheme of things, but enough to disrupt our regular schedule. I happened to be working at <a href="http://www.indyhall.org/" target="_blank">Indy Hall</a> that day, so there was a bit of frantic communication from me to the nanny to Al to me via phone and text. In the process, a couple wires got crossed, and I ended up leaving Indy Hall for home when backup childcare had already been arranged, and... yadda yadda yadda, you don't really need to know the rest.
</p>


<p>
I can't remember whether it was that night or the night before the emergency that Al and I watched the 60 Minutes interview with the pilot of the USAir flight that landed in the Hudson, but one of the things that struck both of us from that interview was the procedural shorthand that the pilots adopted when trying to figure out what to do in the space of about 3 minutes&#8212;in particular the command MY AIRPLANE, followed by the response YOUR AIRPLANE. We decided to try to adopt this shorthand for dealing with childcare crises.
</p>

<p>
We got our first test of the new system yesterday, when the Beaner said he was feeling like he had to throw up right around the time he should have been leaving for school... and about 30 minutes before I had to leave for a desperately-needed massage appointment. Al said MY AIRPLANE, I acknowledged with YOUR AIRPLANE, and I left for my appointment. (OK, I admit, I verified one more time before leaving, "is it really your airplane?")
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it didn't quite go as planned. I won't go into all the details, but the short version is that I ended up on the hook for 6 hours of childcare while trying to attend several meetings *and* get work done for those meetings in between, there was some frantic (and fruitless) searching for a cable remote, and the Beaner interrupted a meeting to complain that the channel I'd finally managed set the cable box to sans remote was not actually showing Sesame Street, as advertised, but a talk show *about* Sesame Street... in Spanish. (I did get my massage, though, so the day wasn't all bad.)
</p>

<p>
It turns out that MY AIRPLANE cannot be used to mean "I'll handle everything until 11am"; it must mean that the plane is under your command until it is safely down at 6pm. Otherwise decisions made with a view toward making it safely to 11am could end up severely impairing the ability of the person who has to take over at 11am to actually land the plane.
</p>

<p>
Last night, when the Beaner started running a fever and complaining of nausea again, we decided to keep him home for at least one more day, even if he was fever- and vomit-free this morning. We also decided that we'd have to fly the plane jointly. Both of us stayed home, and we ended up taking turns attending meetings and playing with/feeding/minding the Beaner. There was one scheduling change for each of us that ended up causing a conflict, and the cacophony of two phone meetings and two consecutive kids' programs was actually kind of funny.
</p>

<p>
Al's gone into the office now, Shawna has arrived to take a feeling-much-better Beaner out to the park, and the house is strangely quiet. I should probably take this time to figure out WTF I'm going to do when it's my turn to say MY AIRPLANE. Well, maybe after this next meeting.
</p>

<h3 class="title">NaNa Shoes</h3>

<p>
I've had these shoes since the early 90s, and I've been extremely reluctant to part with them even though I only wear them about once a year now. They represent a time for me, a style, my personality in a pair of shoes. I still remember the time a woman asked me in an elevator, &quot;are those NaNa shoes?&quot; Why yes, yes they are. 
</p>


<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3284698273/" title="NaNa shoes by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3300/3284698273_1b1749d8b4.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="NaNa shoes" /></a>
</p>

<p>
My friend Amy had a pair, and as soon as I saw them on her, I knew I had to have them, too. I wore them mostly with short skirts and black tights, sometimes to my job at the World Bank, sometimes to clubs. I wore them out and got them resoled. I can still hear the clunk and jingle of them.
</p>

<p>
I finally decided to let them go. I considered posting them on Craiglist or eBay, but instead I sent them with Al on his latest Goodwill run. I could picture some thrifty hipster coming across them and falling in love the way I did, and it made me smile.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Skimpole on Responsibility</h3>

<p>
After a brief interlude in contemporary non-fiction (I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743576853?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0743576853">The Post-American World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=avocado8&l=as2&o=1&a=0743576853" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
&#8212;the audiobook is read by the author, who has both a compelling argument and a compelling voice), I've returned to the classics on my Audible wishlist. I've been listening to Dickens' <a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_BLAK_000506&BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">Bleak House</a>, and a passage from it that I heard today struck me as particularly apropos to our times.
</p>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
As they were to remain with us that day, and had taken their places to return by the coach next morning, I sought an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Skimpole. Our out-of-door life easily threw one in my way; and I delicately said, that there was a responsibility in encouraging Richard.
</p>

<p>
"Responsibility, my dear Miss Summerson?" he repeated, catching at the word with the pleasantest smile, "I am the last man in the world for such a thing. I never was responsible in my life —I can't be."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid everybody is obliged to be," said I, timidly enough: he being so much older and more clever than I.
</p>

<p>
"No, really?" said Mr. Skimpole, receiving this new light with a most agreeable jocularity of surprise. "But every man's not obliged to be solvent ? I am not. I never was. See, my dear Miss Summerson," he took a handful of loose silver and halfpence from his pocket, "there's so much money. I have not an idea how much. I have not the power of counting. Call it four and ninepence — call it four pound nine. They tell me I owe more than that. I dare say I do. I dare say I owe as much as good-natured people will let me owe. If they don't stop, why should I? There you have Harold Skimpole in little. If that's responsibility, I am responsible."
</p>

<p>
The perfect ease of manner with which he put the money up again, and looked at me with a smile on his refined face, as if he had been mentioning a curious little fact about somebody else, almost made me feel as if he really had nothing to do with it.
</p>
</blockquote>
