<h3 class="title">Re-Entry</h3>

<p>
I ended up in my archives just now, I think as the result of a Google search (that is, I searched for something, and one of my archive pages was among the results, and I started reading), and it reminded me that I hadn't written here in a while. I think my favorite thing about this blog isn't so much the brilliantly funny posts (probably because there aren't many, though I do have a snort-inducer once in a while), but rather the record of my life that it provides. I love going back and seeing what I was thinking and doing during a particular period&#8212;I was going to say, "especially since the Beaner was born," but I realize the posts that don't mention the Beaner at all are just as significant to me. (I think Al prefers the Beaner posts, as it's so easy to forget what each age was like.)
</p>

<p>
Part of the reason I haven't written much here lately is that I started a paper Unemployment Journal a couple months ago, wherein I have jotted notes and sketches about what I'm doing and learning while unemployed. The other big reason is the same reason I started the paper journal: namely, I'm out *doing things* instead of just sitting in front of the computer all day. I can take the paper journal with me, whereas I'm making a concerted effort these days to leave my laptop plugged in at my desk.
</p>

<p>
My Flickr stream is probably a more accurate record of what I'm up to these days than this blog (has been), which is why I referred my mom to it the other day. Here's a summary of what you'll find there:
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3885096284/" title="I play happy golf by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2455/3885096284_b6257d798c.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="I play happy golf" /></a>
</p>
<p class="picStory">
I've been golfing a couple times a week (usually playing 9 holes, sometimes going to the driving range or playing 18) for about a month now, and I'm totally hooked. Playing in the morning leaves time for OpenAjax work, job hunting, house cleaning, and meetings in the afternoon, but sadly I don't think I'll be able to work it into a regular 9-5 schedule when I go back to work. Or maybe I'll find a job where I can golf one morning a week&#8212;who knows?
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

</p>
<p class="picStory">
After a couple months of silence, suddenly I'm interviewing again. I'm negotiating a contract(-to-hire) position at the moment, and I've had three other phone interviews in the past week (including the one I was waiting for in the photo on the right). It's an interesting time on the career front.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

</p>
<p class="picStory">
A couple weeks ago I went out to San Francisco to visit Winsha and Kristin. It was a marvelous four days of catching up and hanging out, of enjoying unemployment and being reminded of how much fun work can be.
</p>

</p>
<p class="picStory">
Next week the Beaner starts phase-in at school, and Wednesday of last week Shawna needed the day off, so I took the opportunity to spend three whole days with my kid. On Wednesday we took the bus up to NYC to visit his cousin, and on Thursday we drove down to Washington, DC to spend a long weekend and see the sights. On Friday we met up with <a href="http://sarahandthegoonsquad.com/" target="a8_win">Sarah and the Goon Squad</a> and visited the Smithsonian's Museum of American History. <a href="http://lauriewrites.typepad.com/" target="a8_win">Laurie</a> came too!
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3873104350/" title="towel dry by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2448/3873104350_e772f37ac3.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="towel dry" /></a>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
While in DC on Thursday, I noticed that a <a href="http://www.egglestontrust.com/" target="a8_win">William Eggleston</a> exhibit was at the Corcoran. The Beaner wasn't interested in seeing it, and we didn't have enough time on our meter anyway, so I walked away disappointed. Al came down to meet us at his in-laws' place in Northern Virginia on Saturday, however, and we stopped at the Corcoran on our way home together on Sunday. This time I walked away inspired.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure what this next week will bring (aside from the aforementioned school phase-in for the Beaner); it's definitely a turning point on the work front, and will either result in my going back to work very soon or extending my unemployment indefinitely. I'm still not sure which way it's going to go. More when I know.

<h3 class="title">Go Go Gadget Shopping!</h3>

<p>
Al got me an iPhone for my birthday last year, and though I wasn't as startled or skeptical as when he got me an iPod for Christmas back in 2003, I wasn't really sure I needed one. I was grateful, of course, because I'd never have gone out and gotten one for myself, and as with the iPod, it turned out to be a revelation. (Al's always ahead of me on the gadget curve.)
</p>


<p>
When the 3GS came out, I drooled over the upgraded camera and video capabilities (and more recently, over the true GPS capabilities that enable golf rangefinder apps), but I decided that the software upgrade was probably good enough for me. There was nothing wrong with my first-gen phone: it still worked perfectly well, still had good battery life, still took perfectly decent photos, and with the software update, now had the feature I'd missed most (copy &amp; paste). No reason to spend money on an upgrade.
</p>

<p>
Al had talked about how he'd take my old phone and use it as an iTouch when I finally got around to upgrading, but push came to shove when we visited the Apple store yesterday to see if they could fix a screen issue on the Beaner's iPod* and Al started playing a game called <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2009/03/17/lets-golf-a-true-iphone-hole-in-one/">Let's Golf</a> on one of the iTouch or iPhone display models. He asked me to buy it on my phone right there in the store.
</p>

<p>
The Genius Bar was full up, so we made an appointment for the next day (today)... and Al spent the rest of the night alternately saying, "can I use your phone?" and "I think you should get a 3GS tomorrow." (I think this moment might have come sooner if Apple had announced the 3GS in the middle of our joint <a href="http://toucharcade.com/2008/09/26/jewel-quest-ii-match-three-puzzler-discounted-to-199/">Jewel Quest II</a> addiction last spring, but as they didn't, we just fought over the phone. Now, of course, there are upgrade options that hold out the prospect of happiness for both of us.)
</p>

<p>
And so it was that I ended up getting an iPhone 3GS today when we went in for our Genius Bar appointment. The two test photos I took in the store were lost when I synced my new phone with my old phone's settings, but I plan to try out the camera in earnest tomorrow. I've already taken my first goofy video and been fairly stunned by the audio quality. It also feels zippier, and I haven't even given the 3G network a real test yet&#8212;the zippiness is mostly in the typing, paging, and app-switching.
</p>

<p>
So once again I'm grateful to Al for giving me the shove. And I'm hoping the work that looks like it'll be coming my way will pay for it. (I haven't seen anything on paper yet, but we've agreed on money and are now talking start date over e-mail. That's a good sign, I think.)
</p>

<p style="font-size:smaller">
 *Yes, he has an iPod. It was a Christmas gift from my sister&#8212;one that we were not totally in favor of at first&#8212;but it's turned out to be pretty great. I put music on it originally, and Al loaded on a few Blue's Clues episodes. Since then I've added several audiobooks (he's particularly fond of <a href="http://kids.audible.com/adkd/site/k/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_HACH_000086&BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">Arthur's Audio Favorites</a>), and car trips have never been the same. He switches among music, audiobooks, and shows as he chooses (and he *does* switch; it's not all tv shows and movies), sometimes announcing, "hey Mom, Liam Finn!" or singing a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDCDS?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000VDDCDS">Ralph's World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=avocado8&l=as2&o=1&a=B000VDDCDS" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> song at the top of his lungs.

<h3 class="title">Save the Free Library</h3>

<p>
To be honest, I've sort of been ignoring the budget impasse that's been plaguing our Pennsylvania state government. I've been through several of these before in other states (and I remember well a couple federal ones), and everything always turns out OK in the end. There's partisan bickering, a few services that don't affect me shut down temporarily, and every public television and radio station in the state starts freaking out. It's annoying, but the effects are usually limited, and eventually a budget passes.
</p>

<p>
This time, apparently, it's worse than all that. This budget bickering has gone on so long that services that DO affect me are starting to shut down. I wasn't *too* worried when the PBS station to which I gave a substantial portion of a windfall I received earlier this year called last night to ask for more money; as mentioned above, public tv and radio are usually the first ones to cry out in pain. (Sometimes they cry so often it's hard to tell whether the pain is real.)
</p>

<p>
This morning, however, I discovered this: <a href="http://libwww.freelibrary.org/closing/"><strong>All Free Library of Philadelphia Branch, Regional and Central Libraries Closed Effective Close of Business October 2, 2009</strong></a>
</p>

<p>
At first glance, it might sound like the usual public television "they're going to take away Big Bird!" hyperbole. Our nanny thought it was a joke. It's not. Yes, the closure won't take place until October 2, and yes, it will only happen if the legislators in Harrisburg continue to fail to pass a state budget, but the effects will be felt sooner than that&#8212;and given how long the budget negotiations have already dragged on, the threat of Philadelphia's Free Public Library closing is absolutely real.
</p>

<p>
If you live in Pennsylvania, please <a href="http://www.house.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/find.cfm">contact your state senator and state representative</a> and ask them to act with all possible speed to pass a state budget. Here's the letter I sent to my senator, Larry Farnese, and (with slight modifications) my representative, Babette Josephs.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
PLEASE PLEASE do whatever you can to get a state budget passed ASAP. My four-and-a-half year-old son is an early reader and an avid consumer of Free Library books and services. His twice-weekly visits to the library have fostered his independence and confidence in addition to his reading skills. We want him out and about and interacting with the community, not just sitting in his room at home. We can afford to buy him books if the library closes, but honestly, we'd rather pay more taxes to keep the libraries open than use that same money to buy books for our child's exclusive use. Libraries do so much more for our community than an endless supply of books could do for a single child.
</p>

<p>
Please be a voice for our kid, our libraries, and our district. Please act in the spirit of cooperation and compromise, and encourage your fellow Senators and House colleagues to do the same.
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,<br />
Lori Hylan-Cho
</p>
</blockquote>
