<h3 class="title">Re-Entry</h3>

<p>
I ended up in my archives just now, I think as the result of a Google search (that is, I searched for something, and one of my archive pages was among the results, and I started reading), and it reminded me that I hadn't written here in a while. I think my favorite thing about this blog isn't so much the brilliantly funny posts (probably because there aren't many, though I do have a snort-inducer once in a while), but rather the record of my life that it provides. I love going back and seeing what I was thinking and doing during a particular period&#8212;I was going to say, "especially since the Beaner was born," but I realize the posts that don't mention the Beaner at all are just as significant to me. (I think Al prefers the Beaner posts, as it's so easy to forget what each age was like.)
</p>
<p>
Part of the reason I haven't written much here lately is that I started a paper Unemployment Journal a couple months ago, wherein I have jotted notes and sketches about what I'm doing and learning while unemployed. The other big reason is the same reason I started the paper journal: namely, I'm out *doing things* instead of just sitting in front of the computer all day. I can take the paper journal with me, whereas I'm making a concerted effort these days to leave my laptop plugged in at my desk.
</p>

<p>
My Flickr stream is probably a more accurate record of what I'm up to these days than this blog (has been), which is why I referred my mom to it the other day. Here's a summary of what you'll find there:
</p>

</p>
<p class="picStory">
I've been golfing a couple times a week (usually playing 9 holes, sometimes going to the driving range or playing 18) for about a month now, and I'm totally hooked. Playing in the morning leaves time for OpenAjax work, job hunting, house cleaning, and meetings in the afternoon, but sadly I don't think I'll be able to work it into a regular 9-5 schedule when I go back to work. Or maybe I'll find a job where I can golf one morning a week&#8212;who knows?

</p>
<p class="picStory">
After a couple months of silence, suddenly I'm interviewing again. I'm negotiating a contract(-to-hire) position at the moment, and I've had three other phone interviews in the past week (including the one I was waiting for in the photo on the right). It's an interesting time on the career front.

<p class="picStory">
A couple weeks ago I went out to San Francisco to visit Winsha and Kristin. It was a marvelous four days of catching up and hanging out, of enjoying unemployment and being reminded of how much fun work can be.

Next week the Beaner starts phase-in at school, and Wednesday of last week Shawna needed the day off, so I took the opportunity to spend three whole days with my kid. On Wednesday we took the bus up to NYC to visit his cousin, and on Thursday we drove down to Washington, DC to spend a long weekend and see the sights. On Friday we met up with <a href="http://sarahandthegoonsquad.com/" target="a8_win">Sarah and the Goon Squad</a> and visited the Smithsonian's Museum of American History. <a href="http://lauriewrites.typepad.com/" target="a8_win">Laurie</a> came too!
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3873104350/" title="towel dry by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2448/3873104350_e772f37ac3.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="towel dry" /></a>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
While in DC on Thursday, I noticed that a <a href="http://www.egglestontrust.com/" target="a8_win">William Eggleston</a> exhibit was at the Corcoran. The Beaner wasn't interested in seeing it, and we didn't have enough time on our meter anyway, so I walked away disappointed. Al came down to meet us at his in-laws' place in Northern Virginia on Saturday, however, and we stopped at the Corcoran on our way home together on Sunday. This time I walked away inspired.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure what this next week will bring (aside from the aforementioned school phase-in for the Beaner); it's definitely a turning point on the work front, and will either result in my going back to work very soon or extending my unemployment indefinitely. I'm still not sure which way it's going to go. More when I know.

<p>I like the trio of nuts. How did Winsha get that tall? May the force be with you on the contract negotiations. Glad work is starting to turn the same time as school. It looks like you two have had a most excellent summer. </p>

<p>I feel the same way about strolling through the archives. And sometimes I also think it's lucky I write the stuff down because I swear I'd forget half of it if not. And some of it is totally worth remembering.</p>

<p>Great pics!</p>

<p>After our comment spree last night I think I might invite myself on a day trip to Philly for a photo date. ;) </p>

<p>I love your blog. I have been a sad, sad blog visitor since grad school started but I'm back in gear. </p>

<p>I hope you can get a gig where you can play golf once a week. I think that would be great. </p>
