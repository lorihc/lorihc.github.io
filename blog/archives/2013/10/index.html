<h3 class="title">Drummer Who Wants to Get Better Wanted</h3>

<p>
I've now learned all my songs for the School of Rock Adult program, and I'm now working on improving my playing while singing and on adding a little complexity to the bass lines when I'm not singing. Of course, just when I'm getting up to speed—and after Craig booked a show for us at Voltage on November 21—we lost Andy, one of our guitarists, to Miami. At least he's planning to come back for the show. 
</p>


<p>
Nate, our drummer, is not coming back at all. He was on what was to be a month-long hiatus, but apparently it became permanent. Thus the Philadelphia School of Rock Adult Program is now rather desperately in need of a drummer. We are not like other bands, however; we are in it to learn our instruments, not to make money or records. The drummer we are looking for might have a kit in his parents' basement from that time he tried to form a band in high school, or maybe played percussion in middle school band while dreaming of being Gina Schock from the Go Go's. In other words, we want someone 19 or older who wants to learn to drum or improve her existing skills by taking a weekly lesson and spending another two hours a week playing with us.
</p>

<p>
I can vouch for the joy that this program brings and consider it money very well spent. If you're interested, contact me via the comments or Twitter (@wwlorihc), or call Craig Waxman at the School of Rock directly: 267.639.4007.
