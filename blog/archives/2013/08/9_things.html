<h3 class="title">9 Things</h3>

<p>
I had a to-do list with 12 items on it yesterday, and I kind of can't believe the can of whoop-ass I opened on that thing. I:
</p>


<ul>
<li>Cleaned Fluffy's cage (with the Beaner). Did I mention we have a pet mouse now? OF COURSE NOT, because before yesterday, I hadn't blogged since January.</li>
<li>Made the Beaner's lunch for camp.</li>
<li>Made peach chutney with the peaches the Beaner picked at Grandparent Camp (aka the week he spent at my parents' house).</li>
<li>Signed the Beaner up for the winter SOR show.</li>
<li>Filled out forms for the after school program.</i>
<li>Did four loads of laundry.</li>
<li>Made the guest bed (my sister is coming to visit on Wednesday!).</li>
<li>Removed references to uniqueIdentifier (UDID) and replaced them with a combination of CFUUIDCreateString and the keychain in the two apps we plan to submit this week, and created release candidate builds of them.</li>
<li>WROTE A BLOG POST OMG.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I did not get to the mid-year reviews, the bike ride (it rained), or the bass practice (which I am going to do RIGHT NOW, I swear!), but! I blogged! And that's the important thing.
</p>

<p>
Oh, p.s.: I could have called this post 10 Things, because even though it was not on my list, I also played hockey and had an assist. Woot!
