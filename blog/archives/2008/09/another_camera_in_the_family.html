<h3 class="title">Another Camera in the Family</h3>

<p>
I've been envying Heather's ability to create <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heather/2568341439/">time-lapse movies</a> and secretly coveting her Canon SD870. At the same time, I've been kinda disappointed with the picture quality produced by my Finepix F30. It's supposed to be a FINEpix, for cripes sake, not a muddy pix, which is what I usually get. The Finepix was kind of expensive for a point-and-shoot, though, and I do love it for video, so I resigned myself to waiting a while before acquiring another camera.
</p>
<p>
Of course the Universe, which I seem to have on speed-dial these days, had other ideas. Suddenly my Finepix stopped taking pictures or videos. I'd turn it on and press the shutter button, but nada. Oh, maybe 10 minutes later it'd deign to take a photo, like it was waiting for the flash to warm up or something (even when it was set to no flash), but I couldn't take a photo on demand. I did manage to get it to start taking a video at breakfast last week, but only after a 5-minute delay, and then I couldn't get it to STOP shooting without turning the entire camera off. It's like the shutter button just doesn't work anymore.
</p>

<p>
Annoying, but also an OPPORTUNITY. Al made me promise that if I bought a new camera I'd get rid of the Finepix within 7 days, and I will, as soon as I get the few photos/videos I managed to capture in CA last week off the card. After that, it goes to whoever wants to try to get it repaired on my local freecycle list. Meanwhile, an SD870 from Costco is in the mail (or on a UPS truck, whatever). Woo! Time-lapse movies, here I come.

<p>I, too, have been envious of Heather's time-lapse movies. I can't wait to see what you do with the SD870.</p>
