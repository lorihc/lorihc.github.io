<h3 class="title">Restless Sleep, Restless Mind</h3>

<p>
I haven't been sleeping well lately, mostly due to working a bit too hard and too long, mentally trying to get up to speed with my new job, not feeling well physically (hello, fall allergy season&#8212;otherwise known as respiratory distress season for me), never quite getting back in the right time zone after my last trip to the Bay Area (see: working long and hard), and trying to do some long-term planning for the family. Oh, and the recent death of a former hockey teammate that I didn't interact with much since I moved to the Freeze (we played on the same HNA team, but different Freeze teams), but about whose passing I can't help but feel some sadness and angst. So, in short (or rather, at length), there are a bunch of reasons I'm not sleeping well.
</p>
<p>
Of course, when I don't sleep well, especially when work is one of the reasons, I tend to dream strangely, and about work-related items. To whit:
</p>

<ul>
<li>On Sunday night, I dreamed that a male Twitter acquaintance said to me, "That's it, no more cutting your hair by yourself. You have to go back to Julius Scissor."</li>
<li>On Monday night, I dreamed that I weighed only (!) 153 lbs., and that I was so thin I could wear a second pair of jeans over the pair I already had on. (NB: I weigh more than 153 lbs. at the moment, but not so much more that a drop to 153 would allow me to drop even a single jeans size.) I walked out on stage (!) and said, "look, honey! I'm wearing TWO pairs of jeans AT THE SAME TIME!"</li>
<li>On Tuesday night, I dreamed that I was an accordion panel, and I had to keep bending and straightening my legs to test the smoothness of the panel animation. I think I actually did expand and collapse my body several times in my sleep, but it's hard to say for sure.</li>
<li>Just now, when I was forced by extreme exhaustion to take a 15-minute catnap (I set my iPhone timer to wake me up), I dreamed that a JSON to XML converter was not what I needed after all. "If I could only get a Chaos plugin that WORKED, all my problems would be solved," I said to the newest of my recently-hired colleagues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Julius Scissor? What a great name. I just Googled it, and I see it's an actual place. I thought you (the dream you) made it up.</p>
