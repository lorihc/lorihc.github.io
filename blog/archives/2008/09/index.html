<h3 class="title">Another Camera in the Family</h3>

<p>
I've been envying Heather's ability to create <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/heather/2568341439/">time-lapse movies</a> and secretly coveting her Canon SD870. At the same time, I've been kinda disappointed with the picture quality produced by my Finepix F30. It's supposed to be a FINEpix, for cripes sake, not a muddy pix, which is what I usually get. The Finepix was kind of expensive for a point-and-shoot, though, and I do love it for video, so I resigned myself to waiting a while before acquiring another camera.
</p>

<p>
Of course the Universe, which I seem to have on speed-dial these days, had other ideas. Suddenly my Finepix stopped taking pictures or videos. I'd turn it on and press the shutter button, but nada. Oh, maybe 10 minutes later it'd deign to take a photo, like it was waiting for the flash to warm up or something (even when it was set to no flash), but I couldn't take a photo on demand. I did manage to get it to start taking a video at breakfast last week, but only after a 5-minute delay, and then I couldn't get it to STOP shooting without turning the entire camera off. It's like the shutter button just doesn't work anymore.
</p>

<p>
Annoying, but also an OPPORTUNITY. Al made me promise that if I bought a new camera I'd get rid of the Finepix within 7 days, and I will, as soon as I get the few photos/videos I managed to capture in CA last week off the card. After that, it goes to whoever wants to try to get it repaired on my local freecycle list. Meanwhile, an SD870 from Costco is in the mail (or on a UPS truck, whatever). Woo! Time-lapse movies, here I come.
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Consequences of Decisions Deferred</h3>

<p>
This headline and blurb in today's NYT e-mail blast caught my eye, partly because my thoughts on Sarah Palin finally crystallized over the weekend (blog post coming soon, hopefully), and partly because of Al's enumeration of the issues that were important to him in the coming election:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/business/08takeover.html?th&emc=th">As Crisis Grew, a Few Options Shrank to One</a><br />
The downfall of Fannie and Freddie stems from a series of miscalculations and deferred decisions.
</p>

<p>
If that didn't make me think of global warming, budget deficits, the national debt, and the current economic crisis, this pull-quote from the article certainly did:
</p>

<blockquote>
"Today's necessary but likely very expensive action for taxpayers is the consequence of regulatory neglect and of a broader political system's reluctance to take on what should have been clearly seen as festering problems."<br />
- LAWRENCE H.  SUMMERS,  a former Treasury secretary, on the bailout of Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac.
</blockquote>

<p>
Something to think about when choosing a president: Do we want a team in the White House that's going to try to tackle the tough problems facing our country, our increasingly interdependent global financial system, and our planet in the 21st century, or a team that's going to stick their fingers in their ears and scream "la la la USA! USA! USA! la la la"?

<h3 class="title">In Our Interest</h3>

<p>
Here's what I'd most like to see from the news media, or from any respected institution at all: A comparison of Barack Obama's and John McCain's proposals on the economy/taxes, health care, education, the environment, and foreign policy. If you know of a good source for such a comparison, please link to it in the comments. (<strong>Update: </strong>Here's one comparison, of <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/url.cfm?ID=411750">the two candidates' tax policies, from the Tax Policy Center</a>.)
</p>

<p>
I've been interested in getting such info for a while, but a comment by someone I know over the weekend made me even more interested in getting it. This person said, "when you're a small business owner, you don't vote to raise taxes" in reply to my question about whether he knew for whom he'd be voting in November. I knew from his preceding comment, that he was at the opposite end of the political spectrum from me (though I'm not sure he really knows how close I am to the middle :-), that he meant he'd be voting for McCain. But the tax comment puzzled me, because he apparently meant that he was voting his business interests, I wasn't sure that he really *was* voting in his best interests as a small business owner.
</p>

<p>
It's obvious to me after the last eight years of the Bush administration, and the four and eight years of the Bush I and Reagan administrations before that, that Republicans are for BIG business. But are they for small business? Or do they tout less regulation and lower taxes, while actually making government bigger and more invasive? The latter is my impression, but I'd like some hard facts. Bring on the policy comparisons, please: Help us figure out what's really in our best interests. It certainly isn't Sideshow Politics about pigs and lipstick.

<h3 class="title">Restless Sleep, Restless Mind</h3>

<p>
I haven't been sleeping well lately, mostly due to working a bit too hard and too long, mentally trying to get up to speed with my new job, not feeling well physically (hello, fall allergy season&#8212;otherwise known as respiratory distress season for me), never quite getting back in the right time zone after my last trip to the Bay Area (see: working long and hard), and trying to do some long-term planning for the family. Oh, and the recent death of a former hockey teammate that I didn't interact with much since I moved to the Freeze (we played on the same HNA team, but different Freeze teams), but about whose passing I can't help but feel some sadness and angst. So, in short (or rather, at length), there are a bunch of reasons I'm not sleeping well.
</p>

<p>
Of course, when I don't sleep well, especially when work is one of the reasons, I tend to dream strangely, and about work-related items. To whit:
</p>

<ul>
<li>On Sunday night, I dreamed that a male Twitter acquaintance said to me, "That's it, no more cutting your hair by yourself. You have to go back to Julius Scissor."</li>
<li>On Monday night, I dreamed that I weighed only (!) 153 lbs., and that I was so thin I could wear a second pair of jeans over the pair I already had on. (NB: I weigh more than 153 lbs. at the moment, but not so much more that a drop to 153 would allow me to drop even a single jeans size.) I walked out on stage (!) and said, "look, honey! I'm wearing TWO pairs of jeans AT THE SAME TIME!"</li>
<li>On Tuesday night, I dreamed that I was an accordion panel, and I had to keep bending and straightening my legs to test the smoothness of the panel animation. I think I actually did expand and collapse my body several times in my sleep, but it's hard to say for sure.</li>
<li>Just now, when I was forced by extreme exhaustion to take a 15-minute catnap (I set my iPhone timer to wake me up), I dreamed that a JSON to XML converter was not what I needed after all. "If I could only get a Chaos plugin that WORKED, all my problems would be solved," I said to the newest of my recently-hired colleagues.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="title">Not the Only Reason I Cried Today</h3>

<p>
&lt;riiiing&gt;
</p>

<p>
"Hi Mom!"
</p>

<p>
"Hi buddy! How did you know...?"
</p>

<p>
"I missed you when you were there and I was here!"
</p>

<p>
"Aw, I missed you, too! Did you have a good day?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes! And how was YOUR day?"
</p>

<p>
"Aww, well, I'm at a conference..."
</p>

<p>
"Hooray! I LOVE conferences!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! Ha ha! Well..."
</p>

<p>
"I'm just kidding. Hee!"
</p>

<p>
"Right, of course. Well, I met lots of new people today..."
</p>

<p>
"Yaaaay!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was good, meeting new people. That's hard sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Yeah." 
</p>

<p>
"I wish I was there to snuggle you."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you were here to snuggle me, too." [To his dad: "Do we have time? OK. OK."] "Mom, I have to go, but Daddy's going to talk to you."
</p>

<p>
"OK, thanks buddy, I love you."
</p>
