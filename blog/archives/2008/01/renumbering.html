<h3 class="title">Renumbering</h3>

<p>
There's nothing quite like adding the last few photos of 2007 to your <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157600238740199/">My Every Day</a> set and discovering an off-by-one error that happened back in September. Yes, I forgot to add a photo for September 20, and all the Day and Photo numbers have been off by one since then. Renumbering, tediously, right now. /sigh/
</p>
<p>
And yes, there have definitely been times where I wished that I'd just named all the My Every Day photos "My Every Day (1)", "My Every Day (2)", and so on, like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lorilea/sets/72157594364226820/">Lori did</a>. I can't resist *actual* titles, however, so I stuck with my weird Day|Photo numbering system, and oh, how painful it is. Maybe I should have just started over again on January 1...
</p>

<p>
<em>Update: </em> Turns out I was off by TWO. I also forgot to add a photo for November 9. Good thing I thought to double-check the numbers at November 16...
</p>

<p>
<em>Update II: </em>OK, I've totally screwed this up. I had a photo for November 9, and I numbered it (using the off-by-one numbering); I just didn't add it to the set. Meanwhile, I added *two* photos for November 19. Also, I have just officially broken my vow to go down to bed by 9pm.

<p>You, my dear, are very precise! :)</p>

<p>Even with my crazy numbering system, I was off some days. I'd forget which number I was on and mistype. And I often missed the titling too. How fun is it to name them all the same thing?</p>
