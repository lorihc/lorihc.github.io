<h3 class="title">Why Yes, I Do Take Each and Every One of Them As a Personal Insult. Why Do You Ask?</h3>

<p>
Short-answer questions from Unit 2 of my online C++ course, and my short answers:
</p>
<p>
1. What is the size of a class object?
</p>

<p class="sarcasm">
Tell me why this is important, and I might care. Or not.
</p>

<p>
2. What is the difference between a class and an object?
</p>

<p class="sarcasm">
Yeah. See above.
</p>

<p>
3. In general, why is it a bad idea to make data members public?
</p>

<p class="sarcasm">
I know, but I have no interest in trying to put my knowledge into words.
</p>

<p>
4. What are the similarities and differences of structures and classes? When do you use one versus the other in C++?
</p>

<p class="sarcasm">
See answer to #3.
</p>

<p>
5. What is the primary advantage that C++ classes have over C structures?
</p>

<p class="sarcasm">
Um, clarity? Automatic constructors and destructors? Something else? &lt;shrug&gt;
</p>

<p>
 6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using defaultable parameters?
</p>

<p class="sarcasm">
Why don't YOU tell ME? That would save us all a lot of time and trouble.
</p>

<p>
7. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using name and operator overloading?
</p>

<p class="sarcasm">
See #6.
</p>

<p>
8. Why might it be hazardous to overload comparison operators?
</p>

<p class="sarcasm">
How about I just promise not to, and we'll call it even, OK? (Ooh! Unintentional humor!)
</p>

<p>
I am so not cut out for learning this way.

<p>I feel your pain. Andy is taking an online C++ class too and hating it. Is it too late for you to drop the class?</p>
