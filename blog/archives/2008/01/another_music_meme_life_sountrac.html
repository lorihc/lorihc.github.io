<h3 class="title">Another Music Meme: Life Sountrack</h3>

<p>
I've seen this one before, but never when I had access to my complete iTunes library. Today I happened across <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mylakent/1232479609/in/set-72157603827458991/">Myla's version</a> in the notes to one of her Flickr photos, and thought I'd give it a try. Some of the songs seem spot on; others, not so much. I thought it was interesting that the movie of my life opens and closes with Renaissance/Early music... and there's not a Radiohead song to be found anywhere.

<p>I made an attempt at this, but after hitting "next" 12 times in iTunes, 9 of the selections were various chapter pieces from different Harry Potter books, one was a chapter from a book on tape I bought my husband, and the remaining 2 were country songs from CD's that belong to my husband.  I would have to say, it didn't quite work for me.</p>

<p>I actually used my "All (Incl. Holiday)" playlist rather than the uberplaylist because the former excludes podcasts and books (though not TV for some reason -- gotta figure out how to fix that). I didn't want Harry Potter chapters coming up, either.</p>

<p>The Deee-Lite, Des'ree, Peter Gabriel, Counting Crows, and Lush are all Al's; the Randy Newman is the Beaner's. It's probably why it didn't quite work for me, either. I wonder if there's a way to limit it just to my music? Maybe I should try again with my All Favorites (Incl. Holiday) playlist. :-)<br />
