<h3 class="title">On Freecycling the Turkey Fryer</h3>

<p>
I put our turkey fryer on freecycle last night. I got it out of the garage, washed the dust off it, and set it near the front door for pickup (I have about 8 people waiting behind the woman who said she'd come today around noon, in case she doesn't show up). 
</p>
<p>
We're not just giving away a perfectly good turkey fryer, though. We're acknowledging that we're never going to be the kind of people who host large gatherings of friends for turkey fries or clambakes or lobster boils. Both of us love the idea of hosting such gatherings, and we have tons of paraphernalia around the house <em>just in case</em> we should ever be called on to do so.
</p>

<p>
But the fact of the matter is, at our core we're introverts. We're homebodies who'd rather get in our jammies and watch TV than go out and be social. We're people who love our friends, but the kinds of friends we tend to keep are the ones who can go long stretches without any direct communication from us.  We're very self-contained, living to amuse only ourselves (and now, our kid). These traits do not tend to attract large groups of people looking for a great time. It pains us to admit this, but it's true.
</p>

<p>
Is there something you're holding onto for a "just in case" that will never happen?

<p>craft supplies - bookmaking stuff, stamping stuff, and the like. i really WANT to be the kind of person who makes beautiful handmade books and gives them away to people, but dear god it's fiddly! and i'm NOT a fiddly person.</p>

<p>slowly i've been culling it though - i think i'm down to a small plastic tub of implements and a few piles of paper.</p>

<p>A hope chest filled with my hopes from my 20s - the cute lingerie and baby stuff - if I was to get married and have little people.  Has yet to happen.  </p>

<p>Chest & stuff is in storage.  Never know, might find a good, single fellow sooner rather than later, but then I'd have to get a breast reduction or go on a starvation diet as all the bras are a 34b.  </p>

<p>You are <em>way</em> ahead.  Many Americans keep a whole <em>house</em> just in case they want to throw a party.  That soaring foyer, the huge living rooms...course, then everyone just ends up hanging out in the kitchen anyway.  :-)</p>

<p>oh...this brought a bittersweet tear to my eye -- having been part of the inaugural turkey fry (I think that year we hosted Thanksgiving in Sunnyvale.  I did have video but I think I lost it somehow due to user error -- d'oh!).  Al and John's example of inviting all their friends who weren't going home for Thanksgiving over is one I cite often -- and while we too are more focused on our little family and don't really socialize unless it's an early evening dinner or brunch on the weekend (read: fits SPL's schedule), we do miss Thanksgiving with you all in particular.  Glad you found the fryer a good home.</p>

<p>Funny, the Beaner asked what the big contraption was by the door, and I told him the whole story of how Daddy and John -- SPL's dad -- tried to fry a turkey on Thanksgiving in this thing, and how they failed, and we ended up having to cook the turkey in a special quick-cook bag in the oven instead, and how we re-did Thanksgiving a couple weeks later just to prove that a turkey could, indeed, be fried. :-)</p>

<p>Al and I also talked about the big singleton Thanksgiving dinners and how much we missed those. Truly, the thing we miss most about California is our friends.</p>
