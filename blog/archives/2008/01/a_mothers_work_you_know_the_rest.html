<h3 class="title">A Mother's Work... You Know The Rest</h3>

<p>
The Beaner is downstairs wailing because he wanted me to stay down there with him, and instead I climbed the stairs to my office after feeding him lunch. I have a meeting in 7 minutes for which I have not prepared because I couldn't get him off me.
</p>
<p>
I chased him around after he was done eating, and then we sat and snuggled for five minutes, until Aura came in... at which point he went from snuggling me sweetly to clinging to me in a panic and whining that he wanted Mommy to stay. I think this gives credence to my theory that part of the reason he was so happy to see and play with Aura after Christmas is that we spent so much time together as a family during that holiday week. The more attention he gets from us, the happier he is to also get attention from Aura. If what we give isn't enough, no amount of cheeriness on Aura's part will do.
</p>

<p>
For the past couple weeks the Beaner has suggested regularly that I stay at home with him during the day and work at night. It'd be a great solution if I didn't need to sleep or spend time with Al or be available to my colleagues in Hamburg and San Francisco when they are also awake.

<p>It's always so tough when they ask you to stay. We've had a lot more of that lately too.</p>
