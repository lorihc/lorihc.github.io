<h3 class="title">Yo Gabba Gabba!</h3>

<p>
I've been working on a long post for days now, and it's holding back a flood of smaller items. I've decided just to let loose with the small stuff, and get the longer post up as soon as I can.
</p>
<p>
As I write this the Beaner is downstairs watching Yo Gabba Gabba!, by request. <a href="http://sarahandthegoonsquad.com/">Sarah</a> had mentioned that her son LOVED it, but I didn't get around to trying it out on the Beaner until Sunday night. His reaction was somewhat lukewarm; he danced to one segment in the middle almost involuntarily, but he stubbornly refused to dance or sing or follow any of the other prompts.
</p>

<p>
About half an hour ago he started talking about watching Wonder Pets (which I also screened for the first time on Sunday night) and Yo Gabba Gabba! He then said, "maybe we could watch Yo Gabba Gabba! first. The naptime one. You know, the one about naptime and sleeping. THAT ONE." So I found it on OnDemand, and as soon as the bit about the getting your wiggles out came on, he was wiggling like a maniac. He's hooked.

<p>Both of those programs took some getting used to, but became favorites.  </p>

<p>In an intense but short-lived way typical of little ones.</p>

<p>Personally, I love anything that makes him dance!</p>

<p>I love DJ Lance Rock or whatever his name is. I covet his orange hat and glasses. <br />

<p>Devin was just talking about how much his son liked Yo Gabba Gabba too yesterday and sang part of a song about "the party in your stomach" from one of their episodes while we were riding on the train. I'm thinking I need to check out this show too.</p>
