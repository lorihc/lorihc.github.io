<h3 class="title">Miscommuniqu&eacute;s</h3>

<p>
Years ago I had an idea to design a line of t-shirts with hilarious mis-communications on the front, and what was really meant in small letters on the back, up by the shoulders. THIS IDEA COPYRIGHT LORI HYLAN, CIRCA 1993 OR 1994. Anyway, what gave me the idea was reading the transcript of a seminar at the World Bank, where I was working at the time. A grad student from Harvard and I, a research assistant, were charged with writing up a synopsis of the discussions.
</p>
<p>
S. was reading the transcript out loud when he came to a section that said, "in order to match my sprocket." Huuuuhhh...what? After reading all the text around that section and speculating for about 10 minutes, we finally realized what the transcriptionist had mis-heard: it should have read "in order to maximize profits."
</p>

<p>
I couldn't stop laughing over this, and promptly made a sign for my office door, printed on an air mail envelope, that said MATCH MY SPROCKET! I still shout it randomly to this day when I'm feeling silly, or if I totally mis-hear someone. (Another favorite expression for a similar situation: "earn more sessions by sleeving," which is a quote from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093886/quotes">Roxanne</a>. Use it next time someone mumbles at you, and you *know* you're hearing them wrong. Save "match my sprocket!" for when you only realize your mistake later.)
</p>

<p>
But back to my point, which was a line of t-shirts. I was going to call them Miscommuniqués, but the problem was that nothing quite, well, <em>matched my sprocket</em>. Since reading (or typing up) transcriptions wasn't in my normal line of work, I wasn't exposed to many hilarious miscommunications over the next 10 years (aside from the occasional e-mail from a bad speller, from whence came the tagline for this blog: 'regaling the web with tales of whoa'). A recent invention has changed all that, however, and brought about new opportunities for hilarity.
</p>

<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the auto-correct feature on the iPhone.

</p>
<p>
Now, granted, that example is not the funniest one possible by a long shot, and it might not even be, you know, actually <em>funny</em>. But it got me thinking about reviving my t-shirt idea because of the opportunities for utterly changing the meaning of a text message or e-mail. We've moved beyond fat fingers and bad spelling here, folks. What we've got is the electronic equivalent of Mad Libs. Let's miscommunicate!

<p>Have you ever used Jott? Here is a recent Jott I sent to my husband: "Dealing to March at Matty's with Beckett, see you after lunch." </p>

<p>In normal person speak that would be "Going to lunch at Matty's." But not in Miscommuniqué, oh no. </p>

<p>Forget t-shirts, this has mad viral web potential! Get to programmin' a site where we can all put in our Miscommuniqués! </p>

<p>Just got an e-mail from a colleague suggesting that we all "hold down to your socks, folks!" Maybe old-fashioned e-mail is still a goldmine, and I just haven't been appreciating it properly. </p>

<p>I MUST have a "MATCH MY SPROCKET" T-shirt. MUST. I can't stop laughing.</p>

<p>My husband encounters an unfortunate auto-correct whenever he types his boss' name into Word. Alas, this occurred to a reporter who accidentally referred to him as "Senator Treason."</p>

<p>Kind of related - when I worked at a religious publisher, a colleague missed this typo: </p>

<p>The author meant to say "what we need is one great public conversation . . ." Yup, it came out "what we need is one great pubic conversation." </p>

<p>The author was a good sport about it, though, saying "perhaps, after all, that's exactly what we need. Beneath his signature, he wrote the title "Pubic Conversationalist."</p>
