<h3 class="title">Bob and Louie</h3>

<p>
Lori's <a href="http://www.freshperspective.com/archives/001012.html">I Hab A Code</a> entry from last week (which I just read a few minutes ago; I'm so far behind on my RSS feed reading that I'm considering clicking the Mark All as Read button and starting fresh) reminded me of this exchange, which happened, now that I think of it, on the same day Lori wrote her entry.
</p>
<p>
For some reason, I often refer to myself in the third person when talking to the Beaner, as in, "Mom's going to do this; why don't you do that." I forget what we were talking about on the evening of the 27th, but we were preparing for our trip to Pittsburgh the next morning, and I announced, "Mom's going to get in the shower now."
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "Who's Bob?"
</p>

<p>
Me: "What?"
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "You just said, 'Bob's going to get in the shower.'"
</p>

<p>
Me: "Oh, right. I was trying to say 'Mom' [of course it came out as 'Bob' again], but it sounds like I'm saying 'Bob' because I have a cold and my nose is stuffed up [I hab a code ab by node is stupped up]."
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "Why don't you just say 'Lowie' instead?"
</p>

<p>
Me: "You want me to call myself Louie instead of Bob?"
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "No, no&#8212;LOW-RI! Your name!"
</p>

<p>
Sorry, kiddo, can't do it. I can talk about "Mom" in the third person, probably because to me she's another person, separate from "me"/"I"/"Lori". But "Lori's going to take a shower now?" No. "Louie's going to take a shower now?" Maybe.

<p>I refer to myself in the third person too, usually as "mama". Almost everytime I do it, I think I sound weird yet I still continue to do it. </p>

<p>"I think I sound weird yet I still continue to do it" is exactly right. Bizarre, isn't it? </p>
