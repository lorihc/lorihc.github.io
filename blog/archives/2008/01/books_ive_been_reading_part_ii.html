<h3 class="title">Books I've Been Reading, Part II</h3>

<p>
I'm trying to (a) read more this year, and (b) pay attention to what I'm reading. I seem to be getting to a point in my life that I actually can't remember whether I've read something or not&#8212;a day I never thought would come. For years I've wondered why my mom penciled notes into the front of books in her bookcase that said, "Read 4/89" or "Read 7/03". NOW I KNOW. 
</p>
<p>
I used to keep detailed records of what I read; it's how I ended up starting the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/books/">Lori's Book Reviews</a> section of my site back in 1997 or 1998, before Amazon had its own reviews. Somewhere around 2000, however, I got so busy with hockey and meeting and dating Al and being somewhat social (I know!) that I sort of let the book reviews languish. I've been half-heartedly adding reviews to the database that I set up after <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2005/02/my_entire_web_e.html#000270">the great rm -r debacle</a>, but I haven't been keeping good records at all.
</p>

<p>
One of the few New Year's resolutions I made this year was to keep better track of what I've read, when I read it, and what I thought of it. To that end I've returned to my 1998 method of entering book titles, dates finished, and numerical ratings into my Palm Pilot (now iPhone). I'm still not sure if I'll stick to the tried-and-true method of waiting 6-12 months before writing reviews in an effort to keep them brief (I find that the more time passes between when I finish the book and when I write about it, the more likely I am to remember just the highlights), nor whether I'll just write the reviews here and paste them into the book review database, vice versa, or something else.
</p>

<p>
So far I've got reviews to write for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOther-Boleyn-Girl-Philippa-Gregory%2Fdp%2F0743227441%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1199277908%26sr%3D1-2&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Other Boleyn Girl</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUnited-States-Arugula-American-Revolution%2Fdp%2F0767915801%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1199278016%26sr%3D1-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The United States of Arugula</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F074327251X%3Fpf%5Frd%5Fm%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26pf%5Frd%5Fs%3Dcenter-2%26pf%5Frd%5Fr%3D150S51EEYXE3CB0M8ZVX%26pf%5Frd%5Ft%3D101%26pf%5Frd%5Fp%3D278240301%26pf%5Frd%5Fi%3D507846&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Boleyn Inheritance</a>, but before I do that, I want to encourage you to go out and buy the book I just finished: <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.ca%2FAmazing-Adventures-Dietgirl-Shauna-Reid%2Fdp%2F0552155780%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1201487394%26sr%3D8-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Amazing Adventures of Dietgirl</a></strong> by <a href="http://www.shauny.org/pussycat/">Shauna Reid</a>. (The link goes to Amazon.ca because the book isn't available in the U.S. yet; if you live in the UK or Australia, you should be able to get it from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FAmazing-Adventures-Dietgirl-Shauna-Reid%2Fdp%2F0552155780%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dgateway%26qid%3D1201487686%26sr%3D8-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Amazon.co.uk</a> or by walking into your local bookseller and asking for it.)
</p>

<p>
It's an easy, absorbing, and memorable read; I keep thinking over bits of it, and have read passages out loud to Al. (The story about the Nutella both cracked me up and embarrassed me; while I have no love for Nutella in particular, the scenario of sneaking bits of my husband's treats until I've eaten them all, then replacing them to make amends, and then exploding when he JUST LEAVES THEM THERE IN THE CUPBOARD while they taunt me... well, let's just say it's familiar.) It's not a diet book, but a memoir about dieting, food issues, finding love (of both oneself and another), and getting support that isn't the least bit sappy or self-helpish. It's just wonderfully funny and insightful and fun to read&#8212;so go read it. I couldn't think of a single reason not to give it a 10.
