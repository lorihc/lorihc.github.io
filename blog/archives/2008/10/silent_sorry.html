<h3 class="title">Silent, Sorry</h3>

<p>
Sorry to anyone checking this site for updates; my long silence is all part of my plan to lose the few readers I still have, because I'm of the mind that you can never have too few readers.
</p>
<p>
It's not that I have nothing to say. If you follow my Twitter stream, you know that I have plenty to say about politics and Ajax library frustrations and the repetitive stress injury that's turning my right arm into a limp and useless (but still incredibly painful!) appendage. It's partly because of that RSI problem that I'm not eager to do more writing than I have to, and partly because I don't feel the need to share my current thinking about work, parenthood, living in Philadelphia, ambitions, books, and politics in any depth. It's easier in all respects to be vague in 140 characters or fewer.
</p>

<p>
I think writing is therapeutic, however&#8212;for my psyche if not for my hand and arm&#8212;so I'll try to get at least a short thought up over here daily and on my hockey blog weekly going forward.
</p>

<p>Good luck with that... but honestly my RSS feed says I'll find you again when you have something more to say :)</p>
