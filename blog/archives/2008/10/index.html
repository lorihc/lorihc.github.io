<h3 class="title">Silent, Sorry</h3>

<p>
Sorry to anyone checking this site for updates; my long silence is all part of my plan to lose the few readers I still have, because I'm of the mind that you can never have too few readers.
</p>

<p>
It's not that I have nothing to say. If you follow my Twitter stream, you know that I have plenty to say about politics and Ajax library frustrations and the repetitive stress injury that's turning my right arm into a limp and useless (but still incredibly painful!) appendage. It's partly because of that RSI problem that I'm not eager to do more writing than I have to, and partly because I don't feel the need to share my current thinking about work, parenthood, living in Philadelphia, ambitions, books, and politics in any depth. It's easier in all respects to be vague in 140 characters or fewer.
</p>

<p>
I think writing is therapeutic, however&#8212;for my psyche if not for my hand and arm&#8212;so I'll try to get at least a short thought up over here daily and on my hockey blog weekly going forward.
</p>

This is surprisingly absorbing so far. I carried a copy of the first edition&#8212;which I got through work&#8212;around with me through 3 or 4 cube (and two house) moves, always intending to read it but never getting around to it. Apparently I finally gave it away, because when I looked for it a few weeks ago, I couldn't find that copy. I ended up buying the second edition for $45 or so (!), and so far I haven't regretted it. It's relevant to current projects and future endeavors.</li>

Shawna got this for me from the library this afternoon, and I bet I'll be able to finish it in one sitting; it's pretty slim. I got it confused with the somewhat more substantial <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCoping-Difficult-People-Proven-Effective-Troublemakers%2Fdp%2F0440202019%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1223681414%26sr%3D1-2&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Coping With Difficult People</a>, which a friend gave me years ago and I never got around to reading.</li>

I started this back in August, when I was still going to the gym regularly and had a routine of reading non-fiction at the gym and fiction at home. I stopped going to the gym when I started working late with the new job, and this book languished. I need to fit it back in somewhere, because it's great. (So great that Fatsis' other recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWord-Freak-Heartbreak-Competitive-ScrabblePlayers%2Fdp%2F0142002267%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1223682418%26sr%3D1-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Word Freak</a>, is already waiting on my nightstand.)</li>

I haven't read David Copperfield since 10th grade (and even then I only skimmed and didn't finish it), but already I was starting to feel sorry for the little chap, and if I remember correctly, it gets worse by the time he gets to London. It's just too sad for me right now.</li>

<h3 class="title">Bonus Beaner</h3>

<p>
It appears that my son has inherited my love of hats. It was his idea to stop in Hats in the Belfry on South Street last weekend, where he tried on a variety of styles. So did I, though I didn't find any that I liked as well as the one I was wearing.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Processor Misfiring</h3>

<p>
I'm having problems lately with my secondary processor. That is, the mental processor that verifies that my math is correct when I calculate a tip or add two numbers, and that tells my fingers what to type when I have a thought, is misfiring. I looked at a $52 bill today and said to Al, "is $12 enough?" My primary processor calculated $12 as being more than 20% and therefore more than enough, but my secondary processor refused to confirm the calculation, no matter how long I stared at the check.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, in the past two days I caught myself typing entry when I meant entree, fix when I meant fish, addition when I meant edition. I shudder to think how many e-mails have gone out with similar word substitutions; if you've received one of them, please be assured that I'm not stupid, that I can spell, and that I chose my words carefully in my head. The words just got garbled in transit to my fingers.
</p>

<p>
I hope it's a sign of sleep deprivation, overwork, and distraction, not of early senility. I'm turning 40 in a couple weeks, and IMHO, 40's a little too early to be going round the bend.
</p>

<h3 class="title">One 30-Minute Slice of My Day</h3>

<p>
I plan to try a few more of these, because any one 30-minute period can't possibly represent my whole day, nor can it reveal how I manage to fit all kinds of activities in (as <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2008/10/in_the_five_minutes_before_i_tur.html#c12792">Heidi asked about in her comment</a> on my last post). This 30-minute period does reveal, however, how short my attention span is. I've said often that if something takes more that 3 seconds, I'm very likely to switch to something else&#8212;which, depending on what I switch to, can either be a productivity boon or a producitivity killer. Judge for yourself in this slice of Friday, October 17, from 4:27 EST to 4:57 EST. (I didn't write down the times of all the task switches, but I did write down what I switched to each time, so you can include &quot;writing down what I did&quot; on the list of things that I did. :-)
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open enormous archive I received from an Ajax toolkit developer with 7Zip. Start extracting files. (Win)</li>
  <li>Upload two photos to Flickr. (Mac)</li>
  <li>Ping colleage on GTalk about whether trunk is open for checkins. (Win)</li>
  <li>Check on status of archive (still unzipping) and photo upload (still uploading).</li>
  <li>Add a folder to SVN with Tortoise. (Win)</li>
  <li>Add description and tags to Flickr photos. (Mac)</li>
  <li>Add photo to group pool, peruse group pool. (Mac)</li>
  <li>Check on status of archive (finished unzipping, but attempting to open unzipped folder freezes Windows Explorer). (Win)</li>
  <li>Engage colleague who's now responding to my IM. (Win)</li>
  <li>Check on status of add in Tortoise window. Complete. (Win)</li>
  <li>Check Google Reader for postings in the two Aptana forums I'm responsible for monitoring. No postings. (Win)</li>
  <li>Read latest TechCrunch post while in Reader. (Win)</li>
  <li>Refresh local SVN folders so I can commit files I just added; Windows Explorer freezes. (Win)</li>
  <li>Check latest tweets in TweetDeck. Nothing worth responding to, no comments to add. (Win)</li>
  <li>Explorer still frozen. (Win)</li>
  <li>IM from husband reporting on status of several things we have pending. (Win)</li>
  <li>Force-quit Explorer. (Win)</li>
  <li>IMs still coming in from husband, but otherwise, machine is frozen. Can't switch apps. (Win)</li>
  <li>Reboot Windows machine. (Win)</li>
  <li>Update NPR, CNN, and Slate podcasts in iTunes while waiting for Win machine to come back. (Mac)</li>
  </ul>
<p>I'm thinking I might slice my days in other ways, too; perhaps instead of writing down everything I do in a 30-minute period, I'll try setting an alarm that goes off every thirty minutes and write down what I'm doing *right at that moment*. I hope it doesn't reveal that I'm eating every thirty minutes!</p>

<h3 class="title">Randomania for October 21, 2008</h3>

<p>
My friend nj introduced me to the phrase <a href="http://wurld.blogspot.com/2005/08/gambatte-kudasai.html">gambatte kudasai</a> yesterday. It's a Japanese saying that means "just keep going, and do your best." Thanks, nj, for saving my day with that phrase.

I love the shirt that the woman on the right is wearing in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/barackobamadotcom/2960873723/">this photo in Barack Obama's Flickr stream</a> (yep, he has a Flickr stream, though since it's obvious that Obama himself didn't take most, or even any, of the photos, I wish they were credited to the actual photographers). The shirt reads: <em>ChristianLiberal - religion without hate</em>.
</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I've become a total podcast junkie lately, frantically choosing Update Podcast on the 9 or 10 'casts to which I subscribe in iTunes. My favorites:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_detail.php?siteId=94411890">Planet Money</a> podcast, from the NPR guys who brought you the special This American Life episode <a href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355">The Giant Pool of Money</a> and its follow-up, <a href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1263">Another Frightening Show About the Economy</a>. It's a daily peek into the global economy, the current economic crisis, and the financial indicators you should be watching to figure out which way the wind is blowing (hint: the Dow is a lot less important than the TED Spread).</li>
<li>It probably goes without saying that <a href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Podcast.aspx">This American Life</a> is another of my favorite podcasts; it pays to subscribe and download regularly, as shows are only free for one week after they air. After that, they're $.95 apiece. Pay the $.95 if you haven't yet heard the two shows mentioned in the previous item (or listen online for free). I also highly recommend the first part (Harlem Renaissance) of <a href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1262">Going Big</a>.</li>
<li>I sometimes listen to <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/">Countdown with Keith Olbermann</a> while I work by turning up the TV in the guest room so I can hear it from my desk. Listening to the audio podcast is just like that, only better, because instead of straining to hear over the other sounds in the house and outside my window (not to mention my fingers pounding away on the keyboard), I can channel Keith's rants directly into my ears via iPhone earbuds.</li>
<li>I enjoy <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/">Rachel Maddow's show</a> even more than Countdown, though part of my enjoyment comes from watching Rachel's "can you believe this?" expressions as she recounts the latest wacko story that passes for news. Still I'm looking forward to listening to my very first audio podcast of her show momentarily.</li>
<li>I like <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2201574/">Slate's Political Gabfest</a> more than Slate's other podcast offerings because it sounds like a dinner party with a bunch of smart, well-informed people talking about current events (whereas the other podcasts remind me of local news editorials from the 80s). It's also more normal (i.e., less vaudeville wacky) than NPR's It's All Politics roundtables.</li>
</ul>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Yesterday I tried an experiment where I took a photo when I woke up, set a timer for 30 minutes, took a photo, set the timer, and so on until I went to bed. (I also set my webcam to take a photo every minute from about 10 or 11am until 10pm and save all the shots to a local folder.) I hope to post the results tonight or tomorrow. The day was mostly typical until my hour of work after hockey practice turned into an extended period of deploying and testing that lasted until 3am. I hope to try the experiment again on a day that doesn't include hockey practice, and that does include the normal nighttime routine with the Beaner.
</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I decided not to write my usual rant about Breast Cancer Awareness Month and the proliferation of pink this year, though every time I pass that damned pink fountain in Love Park (aka JFK Plaza) or see the Philadelphia skyline lit with pink at night, I'm sorely tempted. Instead I offer this article from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/30002944.html?page=1&c=y">Which pink products really help fight breast cancer?</a> I miss you, Pat.
</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
And finally, I just have to say this: <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/born_in_the_usa.html">There are creases in this piece of paper.</a> That is all.
</p>

<h3 class="title">40</h3>

<p>
Yesterday I turned 40 years old, and it was good. My actual birthday was the culmination of a lovely weekend away with my husband, spent doing the things I most wanted to do: eat, sleep, read, hike, leaf peep. I have no photos of the sleeping or the reading, but I've got a LOT of photos of leaves.

<h3 class="title">Forward-Thinking</h3>

<blockquote>
<div>
As we peer into society's future, we&#8212;you and I, and our government&#8212;must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.

<h3 class="title">Down the Hatch</h3>

<p>
I know I moaned and groaned and gnashed my teeth and pulled my hair when we were going through that awful teenage phase with the Beaner a while back, but have I mentioned that he's been an absolute gem lately? I think I did, because I remember mentioning that I thought his change in diet was a factor. That, and the normal ups and downs of the human development process. In short, things are good.
</p>

<p>
That's not to say that I don't get frustrated now and then, but I think my frustrations these days mainly stem from high expectations. He seems *so* grown up these days, so thoughtful, so articulate, so observant, that I can't believe there are things he can't do. Like pill-swallowing.
</p>

<p>
I ended up giving the Beaner my appointment at the asthma/allergy practice on Monday after I recognized the signs of the allergy-induced bronchitis (and occasionally pneumonia) that I ended up with every fall and every spring into adulthood. The doctor confirmed this diagnosis and put him on the same asthma and allergy drugs I take, only in kid-sized doses. He now has an Advair inhaler (which he BLEW into the first few times, to my annoyance, though he's got the hang of sucking in now), a Maxair inhaler, and Zyrtec.
</p>

<p>
The doc gave me samples of Zyrtec syrup, which has no artificial colors, but of course is artificially flavored. I explained that we're trying to keep artificial colors and flavors out of the Beaner's diet, and that given that Zyrtec is now OTC, I would have started him on it sooner if I'd known what the correct dosage was. It took three tries to get the info I sought (probably because I kept trying to provide context for my question), but the doctor finally said, "oh sure, you could cut a 10mg Zyrtec tablet in half and give it to him, if he can swallow it." Child's dose? 5mg. Check.
</p>

<p>
Monday night I had hockey practice, and Al ended up giving him the syrup. On Tuesday night, I cut a Zyrtec tablet in half, explained that he should put it on his tongue, fill his mouth with water, and swallow. Under no circumstances should he chew. What did he do? HE CHEWED. And then he hated me, because the pill tasted AWFUL. Much finger pointing on both sides ensued.
</p>

<p>
On Wednesday night I decided we would practice with bread. I rolled little bits of bread into balls, put them on his tongue, gave him the instructions, and waited while he drank water... AND CHEWED. Every. Single. Time. I finally lost patience and just gave him his half pill, telling him NOT TO CHEW. Of course he did, and I had him spit out the remains of the thing once he made the "this tastes terrible!" face.

After I put him to bed, I complained on Twitter about the experience. <a href="http://ratphooey.livejournal.com/">Ratphooey</a> responded a bit later (I saw the reply in the morning, and at first wasn't sure what she was responding to): Have you tried Rice Krispies?
</p>

<p>
The Beaner doesn't eat Rice Krispies because of the BHT, but we have Rice Twice, an acceptable (and yummier, in his opinion) substitute. I gave him his first rice puff, explained the procedure, and watched while he swallowed...and then chewed. Arrrrgh! "I want to see you do it," he said. "Remember you said you'd show me how?" He was right; after the previous night's disaster, I *had* said I'd let him watch me take my vitamins. So I asked Al to bring up my basket of vitamin bottles, and I dumped out an enormous vitamin C.
</p>

<p>
"You see the size of this thing?" I asked. "Well, WATCH THIS." I plopped it on my tongue, took a huge swig of happy happy fizzy water (Polar Seltzer with Vanilla), and swallowed. Then I stuck out my tongue so he could see that the pill was gone. He applauded. "Watch, I'll do it again," I said. And I did, with another vitamin C and a B complex.

<p>
"I want to try practicing again!" he said. He picked a rice puff off the tissue I'd dumped them on, put it on his tongue, filled his mouth with water, and swallowed. Then he stuck his tongue out like I had. ALL GONE! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</p>

<p>
He was so excited that he wanted to practice several more times. To get him to take the actual pill, I said, "ok, I think we're ready." I handed him the half Zyrtec, and then dumped out a vitamin D into my own palm. "You will swallow that pill, and I will swallow this pill, AT THE SAME TIME." He grinned. "Ready? One, two, three!" We popped our pills, swigged our waters, and stuck out our tongues. And of course, we gave each other thumbs up.
</p>

<p>
"Here," the Beaner said, taking one of the Trader Joe's stickers from my vitamin basket, "you get a sticker because you swallowed your pill." I smiled, put it on my chest, and thanked him. Then I peeled a sticker off and said, "and you get a sticker because you swallowed YOUR pill." He laughed, we gave each other thumbs up again, and then we went into his room to sing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A//www.amazon.com/Leonardo-Terrible-Monster-Notable-Childrens/dp/0786852941?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199218749&sr=1-2&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Leonardo, the Terrible Monster</a>, opera-style.
