<h3 class="title">Wagon Metaphors</h3>

<p>
Titles for this post that occurred to me in the past 10 seconds: Falling Off the Wagon, Back on the Wagon, Hitching My Wagon. Three clich&eacute;s were quite enough, so I stopped there and just went with &quot;Wagon Metaphors&quot;. So obviously the first two are a reference to the fact that I stopped blogging abruptly just after BlogHer. That was partly coincidental, partly a consequence of being (un)inspired by BlogHer. The uninspiration was entirely my fault; I did BlogHer completely backwards from how (I now realize) I should have done it: namely, I registered only for the cocktail parties and not for the conference itself. I did this for two reasons: (1) I wanted to spend Friday in the office, getting some face time with my colleagues, rather than taking the day off to attend the conference; and (2) since I blog for no other reasons than to record my experiences and possibly make someone else feel less alone (i.e., I don't have some Larger Purpose, nor do I blog for profit), I didn't expect to get much out of the sessions. I didn't love BlogHer in 2006, the last time I attended, so my main goal was to visit with some of the friends I made then and online since.
</p>


<p>
While I do not for a second regret having face time with my colleagues on Friday, I do kind of regret not going to the conference (and going to the cocktail parties). If I go to BlogHer again in the future, I'll attend the conference and decide on the parties at the last second. While I'm not really a party person in general, I suspect I'd have a better time at them if I also have hang time with other women during the day, and thus have a shared context. (Or, you know, maybe not.) My favorite moments from the parties this time: meeting <a href="http://www.schmutzie.com/">Schmutzie</a> (she approached me as I walked into the People's Party on Thursday, just after I'd had the thought, &quot;crap, I don't know anyone in the room&quot; and made my evening; wish I'd gotten a photo of us together); hanging out with <a href="http://leahpeah.com/blog/">Leah</a> and finally meeting <a href="http://artlung.com/">Joe</a>; trying to get some dancing started&#8212;in the wrong room&#8212;with <a href="http://abigailmschilling.com/blog/">Abigail</a> at the <a href="http://mightyhaus.com/">Mighty Haus</a> party (yeah, see? parties are not my strong point);  finally getting a GLASS OF FUCKING WATER (Pellegrino with lime, FTW!) on the 7th floor of the Macy's party; and sharing said Pellegrino, tofu tarts, and good conversation with <a href="http://www.uppercasewoman.com/">Cecily</a> (see us in the last photo of<a href="http://www.iambossy.com/i_am_bossy/2008/07/hi-and-welcome.html"> this post from I am Bossy</a>, who (a) was also delightful, (b) <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2694494404/">knows how to put on a Philly face</a>, and (c) describes the Macy's party pretty accurately).
</p>
<p>
The &quot;Hitching My Wagon&quot; thing is a reference to the fact that I'm going to be changing jobs very soon, and is also related to the dearth of blog posts here lately. See, right after BlogHer, an opportunity presented itself. It kind of freaked me out, because while I've been thrilled to be a part of the Dreamweaver team for the past 10 years, in my mind I was making little tweaks to my job&#8212;adjustments I thought, if they were to materialize, would make me even happier&#8212;and it turned out that the Universe was listening. The fact that the Universe was listening was, in itself, enough to cause a mild freakout, but the fact that what sounded like the perfect, no-brainer-to-take-it job was not only not on the Dreamweaver team but not at Adobe nearly sent me round the bend. What to do, what to do? Well, accept, of course, and then freak out some more&#8212;about the fact that I'm going to miss the people I work with, most of whom have become close friends over the years; about the fact that I'm going to be leaving my safe little niche for a position that is very likely to make even better use of my skills and interests but that will be decidedly less familiar; about the fact that I'll be moving to a company that's tiny in comparison with my current one, where I'll be more visible, have more leeway (and more responsibility), and will need to do more things for myself (small companies have a lot less infrastructure than giant ones).
</p>
<p>
I kept the freakout mostly to myself (and Al) for the couple days it took me to make the Final Decision and then tell my manager (and good friend) that I was leaving. After that I told the people I work with most closely, and then the rest of the team. I didn't feel like talking about it publicly, however, so I continued my silence here, thus completely blowing my participation in NaBloPoMo for July. It's difficult to continue writing about mundane things like food and parenthood when Big Things that you can't or don't want to talk about are sitting on your shoulders.
</p>
<p>
So anyway, my last day at Adobe is this Wednesday, August 6, and my first day at my new company is Monday, August 11. I'm excited and sad and excited and anxious and excited. Total immersion in JavaScript, here I come!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Irony</h3>

<p>
Wednesday was my last day of work at Adobe, and I spent most of the day packing up my computers and peripherals. Since I'd received my PC laptop and two monitors from my new job on Tuesday, as I removed and packed the old equipment, I set up the new. Good LORD the new monitors are huge.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2750318914/" title="clearing space for one of the monitors by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3289/2750318914_14812431f1_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="clearing space for one of the monitors" /></a>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2750319526/" title="new monitor, new PC by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3065/2750319526_4ef826fcf5_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="new monitor, new PC" /></a>
</p>

<p>
When I finally finished packing, around 9pm, I had 9 boxes. (Luckily Al had the foresight to save the original boxes for all the computers and the monitor.) I printed out all the prepaid FedEx shipping labels Adobe was kind enough to e-mail me, and then tried to figure out how to arrange for a pickup. I quickly figured out that arranging for pickup would mean staying tied to the house all day Thursday, however, when I had planned to spend the afternoon doing stuff with the Beaner. I skipped the pickup option and figured I'd just take the boxes to FedEx myself.
</p>

<p>
There's a FedEx/Kinko's store 3 blocks from here, but getting the packages to the store was harder than one might imagine. I considered using my granny cart or the Beaner's wagon to tow them over there, but either would have required at least three trips, as the monitor box alone took up the entire wagon (and wouldn't fit in the granny cart at all). I finally decided, reluctantly, to drive, even though that would mean a longer trip due to one-way streets.
</p>

<p>
After wedging all the boxes in the back of our car (it has quite a bit of cargo space, but less than our old car had), I realized that it probably would have taken at least 5 trips with the wagon to get all the boxes to the store... and I started wondering how I was going to get all the boxes *into* the store in one go, considering that it took me four trips to load up the car. I figured I'd just park in front of the store and ask for a cart of some sort.
</p>

<p>
It was only when I made it around the corner onto Market Street that I realized there were no parking options in front of the FedEx store&#8212;only bus stop, a tow-away zone (because the buses need room to get around the corner), and a No Stopping Anytime taxi stand. Past the taxi stand, and really too far to walk with all those boxes anyway, all the parking spots were full.
</p>

<p>
I ended up pulling over by Trader Joe's and pulling out my iPhone to try to find another FedEx counter at which to drop my packages. The search was fruitless, however; the results were similar to those of a search for Starbucks (namely, there was a FedEx location on practically every corner, but none with parking options). I remembered that there was an office somewhere near Grays Ferry Road, but I couldn't remember if it was FedEx Ground or FedEx Express, and it wasn't clear how to get it to come up in the search (search by city instead of Zip Code?).
</p>

<p>
After about 10 minutes, I gave up and drove the circuitous route back to the front of the FedEx/Kinko's, parked in the taxi stand, and put on my flashers. I ran into the store and almost tripped over a FedEx employee who was crouched in front of the packing supplies table, restocking. "Can I help you?" he asked. Woo! Helpfulness! IN PHILLY! "Yes!" I replied. "I've got 9 rather large boxes in my car outside. Do you have a cart or something with which to bring them in?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied, and walked away. OK, *there's* the surly attitude I was expecting! Whew.
</p>

<p>
I went back out to the car and began the tedious process of bringing in 2-3 boxes at a a time. The monitor had to come in by itself, so I think I made a total of 4 trips, maybe 5. By the time I was finished there were boxes stacked all around the gentleman who couldn't decide how he wanted to send his package and was therefore in my way. While I waited I managed to flag down the unhelpful clerk and ask for 9 of those clear envelopes that hold the shipping labels and proceeded to match up labels with packages.
</p>

<p>
By the time I was finished, so was the waffling gentleman. The other clerk then weighed and scanned each package and gave me a receipt, and I was able to dash back out to my car a final time. No ticket on the windshield, woo! (When I called Al to tell him the story, I ended with, "and I didn't get a ticket!", to which he replied, "that you know of." RIGHT. Here in Philly, if a parking inspector spots you parked illegally and starts making out a ticket for you but is either too lazy to put it on your windshield or doesn't get an opportunity because you pull away from your illegal spot before s/he's done, you find out about the ticket only when you get a notice in the mail that you're being fined an extra $20 in addition to the amount of the original ticket for not paying the original ticket, which you didn't know about.)
</p>

<p>
OK, so TRIP TO FEDEX SUCCESSFUL, as far as I knew. After a quick shower, I had about an hour before the Beaner got out of camp in which to set up my new PC and try to get some preliminary work done for my new job.
</p>

<p>
After the Beaner pickup, we hung out for a bit at home, talked about what he'd done at camp, and then called Al to see if he wanted to meet for lunch. He did, so we walked over to Al's building and had a pleasant lunch in its new upscale food court.
</p>

<p>
After lunch we spent about an hour reading books (and buying three of them) at Borders, and then we stopped for coffee on the way home. On our arrival back at the house, I noticed a FedEx envelope on the floor by the mail slot, and as I usually do, I opened the front door to see if the mailman had left any packages wedged in the storm door.
</p>

<p>
You know what I found, right? A FedEx notice that a delivery was attempted, and that I could retrieve my package at 3600 Grays Ferry Road. Well, at least I knew the address of the place now, and that it was a FedEx Express facility. Oh, and the fact that a MacBook was waiting for me there was some consolation as well.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Fueled by Futureshakes</h3>

<p>
I'm on my second week at my new job, and it's been interesting so far. It's a bit harder to get rolling remotely when you don't already know the team and its procedures, as I did when I contracted for Macromedia from Philly and later returned to Adobe full-time after the merger, but I think I've been doing fairly well. My to-do list is huge&#8212;there appears to have been some pent-up demand for someone in my position&#8212;but I'm starting to knock things off, if not as fast as things are put on, then at least with increasing speed and confidence.
</p>

<p>
I'm looking forward to my first office visit, which takes place next week, to really get up to speed. (I doubt very much that I'll make it up to San Francisco while I'm there, but I'm making plans to meet Winsha for some skating sessions near the office in San Mateo.) I've also booked my trip to Boston for <a href="http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/html/index.html">The Ajax Experience</a> in Boston at the end of September, where I hope to talk with toolkit developers, JavaScripters, and Aptana Studio and Jaxer users (geekfest!) and hand out a few t-shirts. Look for me if you'll be there; I can't guarantee what color my hair will be, but I think I'll be hard to miss.
</p>

<p>
On the homefront, I've got a backlog of Beaner updates to post, family adventure photos to share, and food to describe. Taking the last point first: I've been on a shake kick lately, which seems to be both keeping me going physically, sharpening my focus mentally, and getting me out of the eat-everything-in-sight rut I'd been in. The "My Saved Meals" column on <a href="http://www.thedailyplate.com/">my daily plate</a> is now filled with items such as Sir Strawberry Shake, Green Velvet Shake, Strawberry C Monster Shake, and my personal standby favorite, the Chocolate Future Shake.
</p>

<p>
The Future Shake is named after the Odwalla product that was available until a few years ago, when they ruined it (IMHO) by turning it into a high-protein shake. My version's a bit less sweet and slightly thicker, but it's very reminiscent.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Homemade Chocolate Future Shake</strong>
</p>

<p>
1 T. protein powder (I use soy-free veg, but any unflavored protein powder will do)<br />
2 T. rolled oats or multigrain cereal<br />
1 T. ground flaxseed<br />
1 T. unsweetened cocoa powder (I use Trader Joe's organic)<br />
1/2 c. crushed ice<br />
1 c. Odwalla Mango Tango<br />
2/3 c. plain soy milk
</p>

<p>
Spoon protein powder, cocoa powder (I tend to use heaping tablespoons of these), oats, and flaxseed meal into a blender. Cover with the ice. Pour in Mango Tango and soy milk. Blend on low speed to mix, then high speed for about 2 minutes, until the oats are sufficiently ground, or until you go deaf.
</p>

<p>
Yield: One pint + a little extra. Nutrition info: 335 calories, 7g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 146mg sodium, 54g carbs, 36g sugars, 7g fiber, 13g protein. Keeps you full for hours, and satisfies a chocolate craving. The fiber always makes me want to drink more water after I'm finished, too.

<h3 class="title">Beaner Update</h3>

<p>
Wanted to give a quick Beaner update before this stage passes completely, and I don't remember it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Reading and Writing</strong><br />
I've been dying for the Beaner to learn how to read, mainly because reading has brought me countless hours of enjoyment (I have fond memories of eating peanut butter english muffins and reading for three hours straight on our jalousied porch with my sister and then doing all our chores in the last 30 minutes before my mom got home from work when I was in junior high), and I want him to have that enjoyment, too. Reading will also give him one more way to amuse himself without relying on us or a nanny for entertainment.
</p>

<p>
I know he's only 3.5 years old, so it's not like he's going to be reading novels anytime soon, but I figure anything I can do to make him *want* to read&#8212;and to realize he can already read more words than he thinks&#8212;can't be a bad thing. We now read letters together (he LOVES getting letters), and sometimes I'll ask him to read his books to me instead of the other way around. He doesn't always have patience for this, and he still gets more enjoyment out of me reading to him, but there are definitely some moments of pride when he realizes that he can read ENTIRE SENTENCES all by himself.
</p>

<p>
On a related note, his favorite thing to do these days is write. He writes pages and pages of words, creates signs to tell his dad to keep out of the living room, and is constantly asking us, "what comes after 'n' in 'and'?" (or whatever other word he's trying to spell). I think the writing thing is partly a result of Montessori teaching, which emphasizes learning to write before learning to read, though it's also probably just an extension of his love of drawing and coloring and pencil-sharpening.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<strong>Stop Me If You've Heard This One Before</strong><br />
Lately the Beaner's been telling the stupidest jokes ever, a phase I seem to recall from my nephew's childhood circa age 4 or 5. I suspect I have only more dumb jokes in my future...or, to be more accurate, actual dumb jokes. Right now most of the Beaner's jokes are not just not funny, they're incomprehensible. He has the rhythm of joke-telling down, but not the sense.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Harry Potter and the Book of Mormon</strong><br />
We spent a recent weekend at a hotel in Bethlehem, PA, where we visited the nearby Crayola factory,  picked peaches at a farm, bought goodies at the Easton Famer's Market, and took a ride in a carriage pulled by a horse named Jack. We arrived at the hotel at around the Beaner's bedtime on Friday night, and while Al readied the pull-out couch in the room, the Beaner went in search of a bedtime story. He found one in the nightstand.
</p>

<p>
"Look, it's a book of five stories!" he said, waving the Book of Mormon in my direction.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure that's a story you'll enjoy," I said.
</p>

<p>
"It's not ONE story," he replied. "It's FIVE stories!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yeah? Which five stories are in that book?"
</p>

<p>
"Harry Potter's Dirty Face, Harry Potter Loses a Tooth..."
</p>

<p>
We never got to hear the other three because Al and I burst out laughing and interrupted the Beaner's train of thought.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

</p>

<p>
<strong>And Finally, Some Wisdom From Al</strong><br />
This was said to the Beaner when the latter insisted he couldn't read his new Clifford the Big Red Dog book because he didn't know the story yet (despite the fact that all the words in the book are ones he knows; it's why we got it for him), but I wrote it down because it's in keeping with my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/1907015672/">sticky-note mantras</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
It's one of the great ironies of life that you learn most when you feel like you don't know anything.

<h3 class="title">Yeah, That's My Kid</h3>

<p>
The other night the Beaner and I were driving to Costco, and I was struck by how quiet and well-behaved he was there in the back seat. He didn't beg to watch DVDs, he didn't ask me to turn of NPR and let him listen to his music, he didn't drive me nuts with questions while I was trying to make a difficult merge. It was so pleasantly quiet that I almost felt guilty.
</p>

<p>
I think the quiet was partly due to the fact that it was the end of the day, and he was tired; partly because he's very interested in reading and writing now, and often spends time in the carseat quietly drawing pictures, writing notes, or reading signs; and partly due to a growing maturity. He has more command of himself now, and it makes me so proud.
</p>

<p>
He did speak up at one point to ask me about a McDonald's billboard that showed an egg dreaming of becoming an Egg McMuffin. "Why is that egg thinking about a sandwich?" he asked. "Um, I think the idea is that it's every egg's dream to become an Egg McMuffin. I think it's kind of a silly idea, really. If I were an egg, I might dream of becoming a goat cheese omelet, or, more likely, a chicken. But I don't think I'd dream of being an Egg McMuffin." He agreed it was kind of silly.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later he said, "I'm hungry."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you *weren't* hungry.
</p>

<p>
"I know, I said I wasn't hungry when you asked me in the garage. I wasn't hungry then. I'm hungry now, though."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, OK. If you can wait until we get to Wegmans, we can eat there. If not, there might be a McDonald's along the way where we can get you a hamburger or something."
</p>

<p>
"No, I want an egg sandwich."
</p>

<p>
The billboards work, I thought. "Sadly, they only serve the egg sandwiches in the morning, honey. You can't get them at night."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"You know, I'm not sure. I bet if they did sell egg sandwiches all day, people would buy them."
</p>

<p>
"I'd buy one."
</p>

<p>
"I know, but sadly, no egg sandwiches are available right now. Maybe you could have a hamburger?"
</p>

<p>
"Sadly, there's nothing on the menu that I like *except* the egg sandwich."
</p>

<p>
Yeah, apparently I inject the word "sadly" into many of my parental explanations. And my son dished it right back at me.

<h3 class="title">Fall = Fantasy Football</h3>

<p>
At the risk of having a lurker join the league and then promptly abandon their team (as happened last year), I'm going to announce that we have 4 open spots in our fantasy football league for anyone who might want to join.
</p>

<p>
You need have no particular skill or experience with Fantasy Football, but you must commit to ACTUALLY PLAYING and not just leaving half your roster on the bench during bye weeks. This is absolutely doable for anyone who spends Sundays watching at least one NFL football game or a portion thereof. If you don't care enough about football to watch, chances are Fantasy Football is not for you.
</p>

<p>
The cost is FREE, unless you get obsessive and need constant scoring updates without refreshing (in which case you'd likely buy the Stat Tracker for about $10; I thought I could go without it my first season, but I quickly caved).
</p>

<p>
Anyway, if you want a fairly casual league with an auto-pick draft, and you can commit to not abandoning your team mid-season, join the <strong>cherrypickers</strong>. Go to <a href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/register/joinleague" target="_blank">Y! Fantasy Football "join a league" page</a>, click the Join Custom button, and enter the following info:
</p>

<p>

The league is now full! Thanks to all who joined.
</p>

<p>
Our draft will happen on or about August 31 (that's when I'll set the league to "draft ready"), but you don't have to do anything except edit your pre-draft player rankings, and then only if you want to. Y! automatically ranks the top 25 players for you, though it's usually good to rank at least 50. The <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy/nfl/news?slug=bf-bigboard-football">Bigger Board</a> gives ranking suggestions for 100 players if you need help.
</p>

<p>
See you on the virtual gridiron!
