<h3 class="title">Why I Am Tired Today</h3>

<p>
I have two posts I've been writing in my head for a while now; hopefully last night's adventures in sleeplessness haven't driven them out. For a synopsis of the adventures, I offer my Twitter stream and one of the grainy photos I took out my window:
</p>


<div class="chatTranscript">
<p><strong>10:55pm</strong> - sorry for the slow responses, folks -- have had my nose buried in code (and blog). I think it's time for bed.</p>
<p><strong>11:29pm</strong> - ack! why am I still awake... and worse, debugging server behaviors? =:o</p>
<p>
<strong>11:48pm</strong> - ok, going to bed for real now. hope I don't get 6:30 wake-up wail from the Beaner.
</p>

<p><strong>12:17am</strong> - power went out with big clunk at 11:56. Totally freaked out. </p>
</div>
<p>
By the time of the above tweet I'd called Al's blackberry and left a message, called PECO's outage line to report the failure (via automated system), called Al's blackberry 4 more times (he was away on a business trip), and was stumbling around the pitch-black house looking for a flashlight. When Al finally called me back, I was on a verge of tears. I was in the house alone with a sleeping 3 year-old, I couldn't see, I couldn't find a flashlight anywhere (the Beaner plays with them, so they're never where they should be), and I wanted to go outside and see if the whole street was down, but I was afraid to unlock the door. What if somebody cut our power *just so I'd open the door*? WHAT IF THEY WERE COMING TO GET ME???
</p>

<p>
Yeah, sometimes I spiral like that.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, Al talked me down, helped me find a lantern and a flashlight from memory, and had me give him the Beaner report (as much to get my mind back on a normal thought track as because he was curious). I finished my toilette by lantern, answered a call from the alarm company telling me that the power was out (yes, thanks, I was aware of that) and I think I finally got in bed around 1am.
</p>

<div class="chatTranscript">
<p>
<strong>2:46am</strong> - The bad news: two guys in hardhats banging outside just woke me up. That's also the good news.</p>

<p>
<strong>2:48am</strong> - Hoping power returns with a minimum of scary noises.</p>

<p>
<strong>2:56am</strong> - Too quiet out there. Don't leave, guys in hardhats!</p>

<p>
<strong>4:18am</strong> - OMG, now whole crew making HUGE racket outside my window. The price of power.</p>

<p>
<strong>4:23am</strong> - 3 big trucks, enormous hose, 5 guys that I can see. Grainy photos on Flickr.</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2400690112/" title="Out window by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3168/2400690112_4e237a8ac4_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Out window" /></a>
</p>

<p>
<strong>4:28am</strong> - Hope iPod battery holds up, or I will get no more sleep tonight.</p>

<p>
<strong>5:50am</strong> - forgot the lights were on when the power went out, so was just awoken to blazing room of light. Dreamed that chipmunk was cause of outage.</p>
</div>

<p>
That's totally true. While the guys were out there working, I slept fitfully and dreamed that I went out to ask them what had happened. One of them told me that a chipmunk gnawed on the power line, and they'd used the giant hose to suck it out of there (like a vacuum, I guess). "Why is there so much sand everywhere?" I asked. "That's not sand," said another guy, who was shoveling the stuff. "It's snow!" On and on the dream went, with me trying to figure out how they'd gotten into the house and set up worklights by the electrical panel (I decided that the power company had master keys to everyone's houses). I also tried to explain what was happening to the Beaner, who'd been woken by the noise and came down to investigate. Imagine my surprise (I woke with an "OH!" when all lights suddenly popped on at 5:47am) to find the Beaner still asleep and no sign that any workers had entered the house when I got up to turn off all the lights.
</p>

<div class="chatTranscript">
<p>
<strong>8:01am</strong> - Thank god kid let me sleep in until 7:47 -- exactly two hours after the power came back on & scared me almost as badly as when it went out.</p>
</div>
<p>
Needless to say, I will be going to bed early tonight. If you see me online past 9am, please IM, Twitter, or e-mail and remind me I said that. Also, a GIANT thank you to the crew who came out and restored my power in the wee hours. (Those PECO ads about how their employees work through the night so you can start the day? TOTALLY TRUE.) I couldn't have been more thrilled to have you making so much noise outside my window. 
</p>

<h3 class="title">Recent Conversations with the Beaner</h3>

<p>
The longer I wait to write about these random conversations I've had with the Beaner recently, the more likely I am to forget every damn one of them. Not even the notes I've been leaving myself on napkins and in my iPhone will help; "discussion of whether Thom Yorke is a Radiohead" is enough to make me recall him asking, but I can't remember the actual discussion, which is a shame.
</p>


<p class="sep">
</p>

<p>
During a visit to Trader Joe's after school last week:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>Can we get those cookies so I can bring them in for Snack & Flowers?
</p>

<p>
<strong>Me:</strong> It's not your turn to do Snack &amp; Flowers, honey. You brought snack in the week before break.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>I know, but sometimes people bring in cookies when it isn't their turn.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>Are you sure? I think I'd like to check with Ms. Erwin first before we buy any cookies.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>I think we should buy the cookies now and check with Ms. Erwin later. That way we'll be ready.
</p>
<p class="sep">&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2404171538/" title="oh noes! by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2403/2404171538_3e189dd7e2.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="oh noes!" /></a>
</p>
<p>
While walking to school:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>&lt;gasp!&gt; Look, somebody ripped that Obama poster! Why did they do that?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>I'm not sure, honey. Are you an Obama supporter?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>[nods]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>The other choice would be Hillary Clinton. [I meant in the primary, obviously.]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>I don't think we should be talking about this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>What, politics?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>Yeah. Ms. Erwin and Ms. Beck wouldn't like it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>Oh. I didn't realize political discussions were banned at school.
</p>
<p class="sep">&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
While planting seeds in yogurt cups last Friday:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>Here, just pour a little water on the seed-starting mix and then stir like this, making sure to keep all the dirt in the bowl.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>I can do it, I know how. [Then, under his breath:] Because I know more than you do.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>I don't think so.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>What?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me:</strong> I don't think you know more than I do.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>Yes I do. I know more than you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me:</strong> How old are you?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>Three.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>How old am I?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>Eighty?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me:</strong> I'm 39. Which is *13 TIMES* older than you are. Do you think maybe that during the 13 years for every one you've lived I might have acquired some knowledge, perhaps knowledge that you do not have?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>Just because you're older doesn't mean you know more.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>Do you know how to read?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>No.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me: </strong>OK, that's something right there that I know and you don't.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Al (later, when I relayed the conversation to him): </strong>You've got to stop trying to win these arguments.
</p>
<p class="sep">&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This one was related to me by Aura, so I'm guessing at the actual dialog:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Aura: </strong>You've got something on your forehead.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Beaner: </strong>Don't you mean my threehead? Because I'm only three.
</p>

<p class="sep">
</p>

<p>
I should add that although he's perfectly aware of his actual age, he's been acting like a total teenager lately. I'm waiting for him to run to his room, slam the door, then open it up again to scream "I'M SAW-RYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!" in a tone that plainly says, "ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?" At the rate we're going, it could happen any day now.
</p>

<h3 class="title">I Voted</h3>

<p>
I did it. I voted.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2433694393/" title="primary by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3136/2433694393_a6cfe6cde4.jpg" alt="primary" width="412" height="500" class="noborder" /></a></p>

<p>
I was torn right up until the last minute, even after long IM conversations with my friends Jay and Kristin in California (in separate windows :-) last night, even after longer conversations with Al over the past few weeks, even after watching Senator Clinton on Keith Olbermann and Larry King last night and the Democratic debate a week ago. Yes, even after the barrage of phone calls from the Obama campaign and its supporters, and even after the Beaner repeatedly urged us to vote Obama.
</p>

<p>
By the time I walked out the door this morning, however, I'd made up my mind which buttons I was going to push (and now that I write that sentence, I realize that I mean it figuratively as well as literally). One last go-round with Al did the trick; I finally knew what I was going to do. 
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2434509312/" title="my neighbor, jane by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3155/2434509312_24d24da995.jpg" alt="my neighbor, jane" width="414" height="500" class="noborder" /></a></p>

<p>
None of the choices on the ballot were easy (well, except for the races in which only one candidate was running); in the State Senate race, for example, I had a choice between a candidate whose literature was less than coherent (hello, editorial?), one who said he'd refuse to give up his role as union boss if elected, and one who might very well be the puppet of the former State Senator who's now in jail. Certainly, bad writing is the least of all these evils, but for me, it's hard to forgive. Forgive I did, though, mainly on the strength of my neighbor's endorsement. (I love my neighbor Jane and her husband Tully, who work tirelessly for the candidates and issues they believe in.)
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, did you know that here in Pennsylvania we get to choose not only the presidential candidate, but also the delegates to the convention? Is that the case in other states? I don't remember ever doing it before, but today I had to choose 9 delegates&#8212;specifically 5 women and 4 men&#8212;to the Democratic convention. This was quite a privilege, as it allowed me to voice my indecision on the ballot rather than making a clear choice: I voted for Candidate A for president, and then chose 7 delegates for Candidate B and 2 for Candidate A. (I might have chosen all for Candidate B except for the fact that I like and respect two of Candidate A's delegates, and I wanted them to have a chance to go to the convention.)
</p>

<p>
So I've cast my ballot in the Pennsylvania primary. Crazily, perhaps, but I did it. I'll probably keep agonizing over which of the Democratic candidates I'd rather have as president for several more weeks, but whoever we get, I feel confident that I'll be able to vote for him or her in the general without serious regret.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Untitled</h3>

<p>
I have so many things to say, but for one reason or another&#8212;discretion, a desire for privacy, laziness, technological hurdles, lack of time, guilt that I should be doing work/playing with my kid/tending my garden instead of blogging&#8212;I'm not saying them here. I've been Twittering some of my observations because sometimes it's easier to blurt out a thought in 140 characters or fewer than it is to expound on it (with photographs!) here, but other observations are just stuck inside because they need more time, attention, and mulling-over than I'm willing to give right now. 
</p>

<p>
The Beaner goes back and forth between being the best kid ever to the biggest, bitterest pill ever, with more time spent on the latter half of the spectrum than the former, and it's wearing. "Very smart, but gives up too easily" would be an apt description of both of us. In fact, I'm seeing lots of shades of my own childhood, to the great amusement of my father. (I find it less funny.) Al and I have been strategizing about how to handle it, and we're tweaking that strategy about weekly.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I know that while the Beaner is wobbling his way through the Terrible Threes, I am being just as inconstant here, going back and forth between incoherent and utterly silent. I'm hoping to break out of that pattern by participating in NaBloPoMo for the month of May. I think the discipline of writing every day will be good for me. I *know* writing helps me process, helps me figure out what I really think and feel, and I need that right now. I may split my entries between this blog and my hockey blog, but I do plan to write something&#8212;posts about Disney World, my container garden on the deck, the UWHL playoffs, and the tournament Shelly, Nielle, and I went to in Greenfield, MA a couple weekends ago are all on the To-Do list&#8212;every day in May. See you tomorrow!
