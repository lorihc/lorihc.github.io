<h3 class="title">Waving</h3>

<p>
Just a quick update from foggy San Mateo, where I've been since Monday (when I abruptly stopped blogging due to the changing of the calendar). I'm really glad I came out just now&#8212;interesting things are happening at the office, with lots of planning meetings and blue-sky brainstorming and random conversations with colleagues, and I'm also getting a chance to catch up with friends before and after work. This is just what I needed after a couple months of feeling isolated and out of touch back in the Philadelphia home office.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, I missed Al and the Beaner almost instantaneously, before I even got on the plane. The Beaner called on Monday to ask accusingly why I'd left without saying goodbye: "when I came down to your room you were gone and I didn't get to snuggle you and you always say goodbye before you go out but this time you were already gone." It was enough to break my heart&#8212;if it hadn't already been broken by his greeting, which instead of hello was "I miss you."
</p>

<p>
I miss you too, buddy. Just a few more meetings and a bit more recharging of the work batteries, and I'll be back to see you.
