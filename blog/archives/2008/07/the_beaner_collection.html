<h3 class="title">The Beaner Collection</h3>

<p>
While on the plane to SF today, I was reading a PDF regarding a work project on my iPhone and found myself needing to make some notes. I pulled out my Moleskine notebook to jot my questions down, but I was distracted by the Polaroid of Val and the Beaner I'd taken in Maine and stuck in the book but never retrieved. I was further distracted by all the Beaner-related conversations/stories I'd recorded in there since last September. The PDF could wait.
</p>
<p>
I know I've already blogged about some of the stories I found in the Moleskine, so I won't repeat those ones now. The ones I'm not sure I've ever blogged, or I'm sure that I haven't, follow. Forgive any unintentional repetition.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Self-Help I</strong><br />
Beaner: Daddy, I hurt my finger, so I'm kissing it.<br />
Al: Does it feel better?<br />
Beaner: Not yet.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 100px">&#8212; 01.12.08</span>
</p>
<p><strong>Self-Help II</strong><br />
[Scene: Al is in the master bathroom, the Beaner is standing outside the bathroom door in the master bedroom, and I am upstairs in my office.]<br />
Beaner: Daddy, say 'ayudame!'<br />
Al: Say what?<br />
Beaner: Say 'ayudame!'<br />
Al: What do you want me to say?<br />
Me: 'AYUDAME!' Help me!<br />
Al: Oh! Ayudame!<br />
Beaner: Mommy! Can you come help Daddy? He's in the bathroom by himself.
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 100px">&#8212; 01.13.08</span></p>
<p><strong>When I Was a Child</strong><br />
Beaner: A long time ago, I was a grownup and you were a kid?<br />
Me: Were you ever a grownup?<br />
Beaner: I don't think so. I was always a child even when I was big.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 100px">&#8212; 04.23.08, Lunch</span></p>
<p><strong>The Beginning of the Know-It-All Phase</strong><br />
[Scene: All three of us are on the beach in Ocean City, NJ, flying a kite.]<br />
Me: Let's go up on the Boardwalk for a bit.<br />
Beaner: No, let's go up on the BOARD.<br />
Al: Let's go up on the BoardWALK.<br />
Beaner: No, let's go up on the BOARD and WALK.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 100px">&#8212; 05.04.08</span></p>
<p><strong>The Whine and Switch</strong><br />
This is the second time this has happened; I wish I could remember the exact details of the first time. 2nd time:</p>
<p>We were at the Adidas Store, and the Beaner asked to buy a watch. I said no, he didn't need another watch, especially an expensive watch that he couldn't read. He whined and cajoled for a while, then finally agreed that we could put it on his list. I put it back on the rack he whined briefly, and then I went to pay for my shirts.</p>
<p>When we left, he whined under his breath, &quot;I wanna _____.&quot; I couldn't hear what he said, so I had to repeat the statement back to him as a question twice before I heard the last word properly. &quot;I wanna WATCH.&quot; I said, &quot;I don't know what's up with this whiny... CRAP.&quot; He replied, very cheerfully, &quot;No, I mean I wanted to WATCH you buy your shirts!&quot;</p>
<p>The first time, I wasn't <em>sure</em> if he was doing the whine-and-switch. This time, it was absolutely clear.<br />
