<h3 class="title">Ugh, Stuffed</h3>

<p>Today's 4th of July bonanza consisted of: Two veggie dogs (one with bun &amp; fixins, one plain); an ear of grilled corn on the cob; four grilled sweet pepper wedges (i.e., roughly one whole pepper); a giant grilled sea scallop; a bottle of Sea Dog blueberry wheat beer, bought in Portland, and half a bottle of Sam Adams Summer Ale; a crazy dense chocolate oval dessert from Whole Foods; some WF berry, cake, &amp; cream parfait with extra blueberries; and a cup of mango ceylon decaf tea.</p>
<p>This does not include what I had for breakfast or snack.</p>

<p>Al, Tony, and Maria substituted hamburgers and beer brats for my veggie dogs and had slightly different Whole Foods desserts, and I think all of them skipped the beer. </p>

<p>Like the Beaner, I'll be sad to leave tomorrow, but I can't wait to get home, work out, and clean out the refrigerator. I've had some lovely meals and treats on this vacation, but now I've got the urge to pare back a bit. The return to reality starts Saturday.</p>
