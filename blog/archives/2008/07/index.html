<h3 class="title">Portland Food Recommendations</h3>

<p>I was all set to write a lovely first-day-of-July post on this month's NaBloPoMo theme of FOOD, but the hotel Internet has gone down, and I'm stuck typing on my iPhone's virtual keyboard with one thumb. I'll come back tomorrow and add links, but for now I just need to recommend a few things to try if you find yourself in Portland, Maine. </p>

<p>Standard Baking Company - At the back of the parking lot next to the Hilton Garden Inn on Commercial Street. Try one of everything, especially the blueberry oatmeal scones, the molasses cookies (get a whole package of those), and the brownies.</p>

<p>Coastal Confections "Rivermill" bar - Dark chocolate with Maine sea salt. Outstanding! Like a chocolate covered pretzel, only with much better chocolate and without the pretzel getting in the way. Available at La Roux kitchen supply on Commercial Street.</p>

<p>The sandwich counter at the Public Market House - I had a grilled cheese on three-seeded bread with cheddar, smoked mozzarella, and tomato, and it was delicious. The market's at 28 Monument Square. </p>

<p>The Merry Table Creperie - I'm not usually a crepe person, but I was lured by the promise of a Nicoise salad and mission figs with mascarpone (the dessert special today). Both were excellent, and the leek, mushroom, and goat cheese crepe I also had was the very definition of savory. The Beaner's berry crepe was delicious, too. The restaurant is on Wharf Street, which is closed to cars.</p>

<h3 class="title">Today's Tasty Treats</h3>

<p>
We started the morning in Portland, where we again visited the Standard Baking Company for both gifts for our Boston hosts and breakfast treats for ourselves. I tried the seasonal fruit buckle for the first time, and like the brownies, scones, and molasses cookies, it's outstanding.
</p>

<p>
We stopped at a rest area for coffee, where I was obliged to take advantage of Starbucks' "Your beverage should be right every time. If it isn't, we'll make it again" policy. The first decaf tall latte was undrinkable; the second, near-perfect. Glad the barista took the policy to heart and then put that heart into the second attempt.
</p>

<p>
Upon arriving here in Belmont, Mass, we placed an order for pickup at the local diner. I was surprised but thrilled to see that they offered not only breakfast all day&#8212;which meant that I could finally have the egg sandwich I'd been craving since we'd visited the bakery&#8212;but also veggie sausage among the meat options and goat among the cheese options. The egg-over-hard sandwich with veggie sausage and goat cheese on an english muffin could only have been made better by the addition of arugula. In the arugula's absence, it was still delicious.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we had for dinner what Al calls the best meal he's had all week: dinner at New Ginza in Watertown. I think Al had a shrimp tempura roll (it had a name, but I can't remember what it was), and I had another can't-remember-the-name roll that involved ebi, mango, spicy mayonnaise sauce, and tempura crumbles. I also got a spicy tuna roll with avocado instead of cucumber ("no problem," said the friendly waitress to several of our special requests) and an order of hotategai (scallop)&#8212;the latter so fresh and sweet that I immediately ordered a second set. It tasted great with the spicy mayo sauce from the mango roll.
</p>

<p>
There will likely be tales of more culinary indulgences through Saturday, and then the twelve days leading up to my trip to San Francisco (and BlogHer) will be filled with weigh-ins, remorse, calorie-counting, and tricks to get the most fill and flavor in the fewest number of Points (remembered from my Weight Watchers days in the late 90s and still used periodically today). Once in San Francisco, the talk will probably be all about cocktails and Mexican food. Stay tuned.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Full Moon</h3>

<p>
Al and Tony went shopping for our 4th of July cookout today, but I'll detail what they bought&#8212;lots of "Lori foods," Al says&#8212;tomorrow, when we actually eat the stuff. Today I want to talk about the dinner we had at Full Moon, a sophisticated restaurant in Cambridge that caters to families.
</p>

<p>
I don't think I've ever seen a restaurant with a play area (outside of McDonald's, that is), especially one that also looked like a neighborhood bistro and that served California cuisine. See for yourself:
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2634392177/" title="our restaurant has a play space. rock! by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/2634392177_7e98593a9d.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="our restaurant has a play space. rock!" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2634387993/" title="coloring by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3062/2634387993_9fa601ac39.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="coloring" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2635220120/" title="another sign of kid-friendliness by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3061/2635220120_55116b736f.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="another sign of kid-friendliness" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I had two appetizers: The beet, goat cheese crostini, and arugula salad, and the cod cakes with caper mayonnaise. The former was delicious, with hot/warm beets; personally, I would have preferred the goat cheese sprinkled over the salad rather than on crostini, but the tastes were still absolutely right. The cod cakes exceeded my expectations in both taste and portion size; I was thinking two, and I got three. They were fresh, tasty, and had just the right amount of potato. The Beaner agreed that they were very good.
</p>

<p>
Al had the carne asada, which I didn't try (since I don't eat meat), and Tony had the penne puttanesca (sp?), which I did (yummy, and probably my choice next time, if I'm in a pasta mood). Maria had a bowl of mussels topped with frites; when I saw it placed in front of her, I wondered how I could have missed such an option on the menu until Tony noted that the dish involved chorizo. I probably saw that word and just skipped over the menu item associated with it, but on a future visit I might ask if I can get the mussels without the chorizo. They looked fabulous.
</p>

<p>
BigP had a hot dog, fries, and fruit, and the Beaner had quesadillas, fruit, and carrots, both from the kids menu. Both kids ate about half their meals (and as mentioned above, the Beaner ate about half of one of my cod cakes, plus most of the avocado that came with Al's dish), and both drank two sippy cups worth of apple juice mixed with water. (Sippy cups are on the menu (!), though I would just get the Beaner a regular juice next time. He was a bit offended when he was given an actual sippy cup rather than the straw version that we refer to as a sippy cup.)
</p>

<p>
I went over to the play area with the kids when I was finished eating, where I read Danny and the Dinosaur and a Dr. Seuss book about monkeys and drums twice each, first to a rapt Beaner and BigP, and then to the Beaner, BigP, a little blond boy who was probably just shy of 3, and even the kid who was probably around 6 who was reluctant to share the trains on the Thomas table. The little blond boy practically crawled into my lap he was so enchanted with my reading skillz. (I admit I step it up a bit when there's hope of drawing an audience of slack-jawed toddlers.)
</p>

<p>
Dessert was the only disappointment at Full Moon. Al loved his apple crisp with ice cream, but I didn't love my warm chocolate pudding cake. It was OK, but a little burn-y tasting around the edges. Next time I'll try the maple bread pudding.
</p>

<p>
Overall, it was a delightful meal, and the kid-friendly atmosphere was incredible. For those not dining with children, here's a tip: Most of the families are gone by 8pm. :-)

<h3 class="title">Ugh, Stuffed</h3>

<p>Today's 4th of July bonanza consisted of: Two veggie dogs (one with bun &amp; fixins, one plain); an ear of grilled corn on the cob; four grilled sweet pepper wedges (i.e., roughly one whole pepper); a giant grilled sea scallop; a bottle of Sea Dog blueberry wheat beer, bought in Portland, and half a bottle of Sam Adams Summer Ale; a crazy dense chocolate oval dessert from Whole Foods; some WF berry, cake, &amp; cream parfait with extra blueberries; and a cup of mango ceylon decaf tea.</p>

<p>This does not include what I had for breakfast or snack.</p>

<p>Al, Tony, and Maria substituted hamburgers and beer brats for my veggie dogs and had slightly different Whole Foods desserts, and I think all of them skipped the beer. </p>

<p>Like the Beaner, I'll be sad to leave tomorrow, but I can't wait to get home, work out, and clean out the refrigerator. I've had some lovely meals and treats on this vacation, but now I've got the urge to pare back a bit. The return to reality starts Saturday.</p>

<h3 class="title">Petulant Foodie</h3>

<p>Confession: I tend to get grumpy when I don't get the food I want. I find, however, that it's much worse when someone else chooses the restaurant and I feel dragged along; in those cases, I can become almost irrationally upset. Al knows this about me, and thus when I don't get the thing I want because of his or the waiter's mistake, he'll be the one to speak up and make it right. I admire both his chivalry and his cleverness, and I lament my childish poutiness.</p>

<p>When there's no one but myself to blame for a bad meal, I punish myself by eating it. Why, I have no idea, for it is punishment indeed&#8212;not only am I eating without enjoyment, but I'm stuffing unsatisfying calories into my already-overfed body.</p>

<p>This topic comes to mind now because today I had a lousy lunch and a disappointing treat&#8212;and I practically inhaled both. It was like bad sex: rather than saying "stop! This isn't working for me" and either trying something new or just putting down the damn fork, I faked the orgasm and hoped it would all end soon. </p>

<p>This is not good. I'd like to get to a point where I can enjoy an amazing meal without remorse AND push the plate away when what I'm eating is neither nourishing me nor knocking my socks off. As with many parts of my life&#8212;food is certainly not the only problem area&#8212;I'm not shy about telegraphing my extreme joy or my supreme annoyance. Evening out my relationship with food might just be the first step toward developing a poker face in other situations, too. Hmmmm. Food for thought.</p>

<h3 class="title">My Kingdom for a Plan</h3>

<p>
I was thinking this week about how both Al and I tend to shop for food based on what looks interesting, what we're craving, what's in season, and what's on sale rather than on what meals we can make out of the items we buy or what their expiration dates are. Thus, we often end up with many things that must be eaten within the next 1-3 days&#8212;which means either (1) something (or more than one thing) goes bad or (2) we end up eating way more food than we intended (or should have). Sadly, most of the time it's both (1) and (2).
</p>

<p>
The idea of meal planning crossed my mind again tonight, when I was writing down what I planned to pack for the Beaner's camp lunch each day this week&#8212;AFTER we'd been to both Stew Leonard's and Trader Joe's. I knew before we went to TJs (and after I'd packed Monday's lunch) that  we were short on protein and vegetables and too well-stocked with fruit and carb-y snacks, but it wasn't until I wrote down my ideas for the rest of the week that I realized I'd not only bought ham, turkey, baby carrots, and pea pods, but that I'd added to our overstock of fruit by buying grapes as well. (In my defense, Al talked me into buying the grapes because "he [the Beaner] likes grapes." Yes, yes he does&#8212;but I already have blueberries and strawberries and pineapple and cherries that must be eaten this week.)
</p>

<p>
With my garden exploding (the peppers bloomed before we left on vacation last Saturday, but the plants are now covered with fruit, some sizable, and we have tomatoes, watermelon, cucumbers, beets, and squash all starting to produce as well) and so many tempting fruits and vegetables at the markets these days, it's going to be hard not to have things spoiling left and right if I don't come up with a plan. I need to write down what I've got, what I can make from it, what needs to be used first, and THEN go shopping for any missing ingredients. (Although I suspect we could eat from what's in the house for at least a week without going shopping once; after that, we'd only need a few fruits, veggies, and dairy items to last another week.)
</p>

<p>
I can do this. I can have a plan. I can have a plan that will save us money, help us eat better (and less), and make the most of the coming garden bounty. I can! I will! I RESOLVE TO PLAN!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Reading the Last Page First</h3>

<p>
[I started a post about bing cherries and pear martinis in an effort to stay within the NaBloPoMo food theme, but I deleted it. While I love cherries, and I think there's room to improve my pear martini recipe, it felt forced. Instead, today I will post a tiny book-related rant.]
</p>

<p>
What the heck is UP with non-fiction books that provide a teaser chapter up front and then go back to the beginning (or worse, jump back halfway for a few chapters, then all the way later)? Al says this is normal documentary behavior; I say that I don't mind a Frontline-like summary up front, but then I want the story to just START AT THE BEGINNING, GODDAMMIT.
</p>

<p>

<h3 class="title">Definition of Terms</h3>

<p>
On his own and apropos of nothing we could discern at the time, the Beaner asked me to define "rude" today. Yesterday, he asked me to define "non-fiction." The latter was relatively easy; the former, not so much. I need to get my explanations to fit within a 3.5 year-old's attention span, which is to say, 15 words or fewer. There's nothing so frustrating as finally hitting on the perfect explanation and realizing that you lost your audience 5 minutes ago. Wait, yes there is: It's having your explanation interrupted by another, wholly unrelated question, such as "should I be turning this clockwise to tighten, or counter-clockwise?"

<h3 class="title">Just Ignore Me. I Get Like This Sometimes.</h3>

<p>
I am SO off the (wagon|rails) with my eating. All the resolutions I make upon waking up each morning have been broken by 11am, which means those of you who'll be seeing me in San Francisco next week will be seeing someone who's at the high end of her "normal" weight range (as opposed to decidedly fat, thank god; that would be 10lbs. northward of where I am now). It's rather unlikely that I'll be at my goal weight by next Wednesday.
</p>

<p>
The fact that I'm about 4 pounds (I know! a mere 4 pounds!) heavier than I was when I got pregnant four years ago, and 6 pounds heavier than I really like to be, seems like it shouldn't be that big a deal. But despite working out regularly, having back muscles that impressed my massage therapist at my last visit, and actual arm muscles for like the first time EVER, I'm a little <em>annoyed</em> at my body. What the hell happened to my middle? It's blobby in a way that usually happens at that point 10lbs. northward of here.
</p>

<p>
I'd blame it on having borne a child... except that less than a year after giving birth, I fit right back into the clothes I'd worn before I got pregnant. Those clothes do not fit me now, due to this blobby middle and what appears to be a slightly larger ass and thighs. 
</p>

<p>
Right now, I have two theories about why my old clothes no longer fit:
</p>

<ol>
<li>I've gained muscle in my hips, thighs, and butt from playing hockey HARD twice a week, without losing any fat in those areas (due to a high chocolate consumption rate).</li>
<li>I'm getting old.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The fact that it usually hurts to climb stairs for two days after hockey indicates that I'm definitely getting a heavy-duty lower-body workout, which is where theory #1 comes from. I wouldn't give up hockey just to stay thin, and honestly, I'm thrilled that my legs are so powerful (ka-zam!), so #1 is more a source of pride than embarrassment. Anyone who wants to tell me I have a fat ass now can kiss it.
</p>

<p>
Theory #2 would account for the blobby middle, and frankly, it pisses me off. My stomach is the last place I gain weight (hips, thighs, and face all come before it), so I'm not used to waistbands digging into my gut. The pressure on my stomach would be bad enough on its own if it weren't also a reminder that I'm turning 40 this year. Forty seemed kind of cool when I considered that I didn't look 40 (in my humble opinion, of course, and apparently that of the neighbor who mistook me for my son's babysitter) or feel particularly old. Now, thanks to the love handles and uncomfortable waistbands, I'm starting to feel my age. The question is, would I also start to look my age if I wore yoga pants all the time to relieve the pressure?
</p>

<p>
I was about to end this post right there, but it just occurred to me that the painful post-hockey climbing of stairs may not be an indication of a great thigh- and butt-building workout, but rather further evidence of #2. Crap.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Chocolate Saturation Point</h3>

<p>
I think I may have done it (again): I've reached my chocolate saturation point.
</p>

<p>
I've definitely done it before, and (luckily), it's usually the turning point that gets me eating healthier again. I remember one time in my early 20s when it happened&#8212;I'd eaten about 3/4 of a 1-lb. box of Russell Stover chocolates in a single day, while working my secretarial temp job at Washington Hospital Center&#8212;and I remember staggering home feeling almost drunk. My mind was a mess, I had a headache, and I felt vaguely nauseous. Yuck.
</p>

<p>
That's about how I feel now; that, and fat. (I'm a pound and a half heavier than I was when I wrote yesterday's hysterical post.) Oh, and bruised, as well, though it wasn't the chocolate that beat me up. The Beaner did that. My nose has been throbbing painfully for the past hour, ever since I leaned over to give him a final WILL YOU PLEASE GO TO SLEEP kiss and instead of settling into his pillow, he jerked his head up into my face. I had to leave the room to hide my tears, and I think that's what finally convinced him it was time to stop noodling around and nod off.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I'm hoping to wake up tomorrow and get through the day without chocolate. I'll have yogurt and berries for breakfast (I bought some blackberries and strawberries to go with the blueberries already have), I'll eat a salad from the garden (the beets and beet greens I ate from the garden for dinner were fabu, and along with the sushi helped pull me out of my chocolate stupor), and I'll pick out a healthy, protein-y lunch from the freezer (I know we have some chik patties in there, and maybe a bean and rice bowl).
</p>

<p>
I also hope to wake up tomorrow and not have two black eyes. We'll see how that goes, too.

One resolution down, more to go:

</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I find myself suddenly exhausted today and in dire need of a nap at 10:47am. This shouldn't be surprising; the more surprising thing is that it's only hitting me now.
</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I have high hopes of being able to sort out my multiple drive problems (only Lightroom and iTunes remain stubbornly anchored in the past and looking to the old locations for files that are no longer there) and get caught up on my photo uploading soon.
</p>

<p>
I'm also looking forward to upgrading my iPhone's firmware and finally getting push e-mail, calendaring, and access to the bugbase while not in front of my computer and logged into VPN. I LOVE that I can get my work e-mail now when I make arrangements to take the Beaner out for lunch or otherwise have to be away from my desk during normal California working hours, but I've definitely missed important meetings because without calendaring support, currently meeting requests are filtered out of my Inbox. I can't reply and say, "that time doesn't work for me, can we reschedule?" or even call in from where I sit. Soon, I *will* be able to do that, and it's thrilling. I just want to get my iTunes sorted so I can properly backup my iPhone, and then I will truly be free.
</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Speaking of iPhones, does anyone else constantly find themselves sending IMs to the wrong people because you fail to explicitly choose your intended recipient from the Text Messages list and instead simply append your latest thought to whatever conversation was ongoing when you last used your iPhone? I did it three times in one day a few weeks ago, and I just did it again this morning. Tedious! (Not to mention embarrassing.)

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
My Canon 10D has been stuck in -1 exposure mode for freaking ever, and it's been driving me nuts (though apparently not nuts enough to RTFM to figure out how to fix it). Well, in my defense, the manual's usually nowhere near me when I'm shooting, and I tend to forget about it when I'm not shooting. Consequently, I have to correct the exposure in lightroom for EVERY. PHOTO. I. TAKE with the 10D, and it's annoying. I also often lose photo quality, too. 
</p>

<p>
Well today I finally resolved to fix the problem before shooting garden photos. It was easy, but not straightforward; the combination of buttons and knobs required to set the +/- back to 0 was unguessable (it involved holding down the shutter halfway and using the large wheel on the back of the camera to shift the pointer). However! I am now shooting at the correct exposure, and my photos are no longer all dark and gloomy. Woo!

<h3 class="title">You're Not The Boss of Me</h3>

<p>
Things have mostly been going swimmingly on the parenting front lately, except for one recent development: A marked propensity for telling us what to do&#8212;and refusing to do what we ask or tell him to do.
</p>



<p>
That is, our kid is finally going through the "NO" phase.
</p>

<p>
This seems like an offshoot of the tongue-sticking-out behavior he adopted during the worst of his defiant stage. And you might ask: How is the "NO" phase different from the horrible defiant stage we went through a couple months ago? Well, that was more teenager-like; it involved lots of arm-crossing, stamping, tongue-sticking, and la-la-la-la-I-can't-hear-you-ing. This is a slightly gentler method of boundary-testing, involving me or Al being interrupted by a "no" in the middle of a verbal mandate.
</p>

<p>
For example, while helping him in the bathroom tonight, I started, "it's almost bathtime, so...", at which point he interrupted me and said, "No." Me: "What?!" Him: "It's still light out. I'm not going to take a bath now." At this point I brought to his attention that THIS, this was the thing he'd been put in the timeout chair for several times today. It was not his position to countermand orders from me or Daddy. Oh, and what I'd started to say was "it's almost bathtime, so I want you to finish up watching your DVD and then head upstairs," but now I think we'll skip the end of the DVD and go straight to the tub.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, while the Beaner isn't into taking orders, he's lately resumed his former practice of giving them. For example, I was trying to get something done at my desk today, and the Beaner kept interrupting to ask questions. Finally he asked, "what are you doing?" I replied, "something that should only take me 10 minutes if nobody talks to me while I'm doing it." The Beaner then went to the top of the stairs and shouted, "Daddy! You can't talk to Mommy for 10 minutes."
</p>

<p>
This was yet another opportunity to bring up the phrase Al taught him last weekend, but that he has yet to fully grok: Mind Your Own Business (or as my mom used to tell me when I was a kid, MYOB). We've been trying to impress upon him for even longer (for the past year or more, in fact) a related concept: That whatever else is happening around you, whatever someone else is or isn't doing, we expect you to act as you know you should, as you know is right. We expect you to set the example of good behavior, not behave badly because someone else is, too.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, in addition to the relayed orders, he's also trying his hand at ordering us around on his own. He's smart enough that I'm fairly certain he knows the difference among "Get that for me," "Get that for me, please", and "Can you please get that for me?", not least because if we prompt him to make his request more nicely, he'll try the second and then the third options in that order.
</p>

<p>
I think this is why I'm less worried about or paralyzed by this bout of defiance than the last: This one is reasonable, logical, considered. He's trying out different methods of communication and seeing what happens (can I order Mommy and Daddy to do things the way they order me sometimes? is tacking on 'please' sufficient to make an order seem like a request? what's the difference between asking and ordering, anyway?). He's coming up with reasonable rejoinders to our decrees (one Al reminded me of recently: One night he and the Beaner got ice cream and brought it home to eat, but it was so hot that by the time they got home, they had soup, not ice cream. A few nights later, after a cold snap, the Beaner asked for ice cream again. "No, it's too cold for ice cream," said Al. "But then it won't melt on the way home!" replied the Beaner).

<h3 class="title">Sharing the Load</h3>

<p>
Last night, after a long discussion and a negotiation inspired by Al's experience living in a frat house, Al and I made a list of all the household chores that need to get done on a daily or weekly basis, and we divided them up between us.
</p>

<p>
Both of us had read an article in the New York Times Magazine about equal parenting while visiting our friends Tony &amp; Maria in Massachusetts last week, and we've been mulling over the implications of that lifestyle ever since. Before we even returned home we resolved to divide up laundry responsibilities such that I washed my clothes and the Beaner's, and Al washed his and the sheets and towels, but it took a filthy Beaner/Guest bath sink to bring us to the point of list-making and general division of labor. I cleaned that sink last night with the exasperation of a martyr, and then I initiated discussions with the idea that I was getting stuck with all the icky household chores.
</p>

<p>
What's probably closer to the truth is that the house isn't as clean as it should be because each of us is waiting for the other to clean it. Each of us has our pet peeve areas, and each of secretly hoped the other would be as disgusted as we were, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for his or her hand in the mess, and just clean the damn thing up. Of course, our pet peeve areas are a bit different, so all the waiting was in vain, and just made us miserable and the house dirty.
</p>

<p>
I must say, there were some interesting moments as we made the long list of chores and then took turns picking items off the list for which we'd be responsible. There were questions raised about whether Swiffering the living room should also include the stairs up to the bedroom and the stairs down to the kitchen; whether dusting should cover all the electronics in the house or be divided up on a room-by-room basis; whether it might make sense to divide the house into living room and below and master bedroom and above. There were bouts of hysterical laughter and evil suggestions that standards of cleanliness should be determined by the person NOT doing a particular chore. There was a brief flap over whether chore completion should be measured every week on a specific day or whether each chore should have its own weekly calendar. But at a little past 11pm, we finally had an agreement.
</p>

<p>
There are still a few open issues, and we've resolved to evaluate how well things are working&#8212;does the division of labor seem fair, for example, and are all the tasks getting done to both of our satisfaction&#8212;after 6-8 weeks. Al suspects that at that point we might decide we need help, and he may be right; for my part, I suspect that I'll be more willing to just do my chores because I know they're mine rather than waiting for Al to do them.
</p>

<p>
If tonight's frenzy of cleaning is any indication, this might really work: We seemed to be in competition with each other to see who could check off the most items from his or her list.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Tomatoes</h3>

<p>
Just a quick note to say I ate the first tomatoes from the garden today, and they were TASTY. The Beaner picked a bunch of half-green, half-orange ones without my permission, but he also got one 95% ripe beefsteak tomato and one 90% ripe Sprite grape. I ate the former raw and the latter sliced in a quesadilla.
</p>

<p>
There are several more tomatoes that are likely to be ripe in the next few days... when I will be in San Francisco. I've charged Al with supervising the picking in my absence, and the Beaner now knows that he's not to pick without a parent.
</p>

<p>
Also, I'm having a bit of shoe anxiety in regards to BlogHer and the various parties I'll be attending. There've been so many mentions of "cute shoes" that I'm not sure I'll measure up in my Dansko Marcelles. Ah, well. I'll just wear some striped socks with them and hope for the best. This is how I am, ladies: Not particularly fashionable, but eminently practical. Get used to it.

<h3 class="title">Packed</h3>

<p>
My original plan for the night was to finish packing and then meet some friends who are in town teaching some classes for drinks. Instead, I'm in my jammies.
</p>


<p>
At least I'm packed. Nothing super stylish in my suitcase; in fact, I'm not even sure I've got enough clothes for my entire stay. I'm too tired to worry about it now, though. I figure I can shop after work one night or on Saturday if necessary.

<h3 class="title">The Beaner Collection</h3>

<p>
While on the plane to SF today, I was reading a PDF regarding a work project on my iPhone and found myself needing to make some notes. I pulled out my Moleskine notebook to jot my questions down, but I was distracted by the Polaroid of Val and the Beaner I'd taken in Maine and stuck in the book but never retrieved. I was further distracted by all the Beaner-related conversations/stories I'd recorded in there since last September. The PDF could wait.
</p>

<p>
I know I've already blogged about some of the stories I found in the Moleskine, so I won't repeat those ones now. The ones I'm not sure I've ever blogged, or I'm sure that I haven't, follow. Forgive any unintentional repetition.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Self-Help I</strong><br />
Beaner: Daddy, I hurt my finger, so I'm kissing it.<br />
Al: Does it feel better?<br />
Beaner: Not yet.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 100px">&#8212; 01.12.08</span>
</p>
<p><strong>Self-Help II</strong><br />
[Scene: Al is in the master bathroom, the Beaner is standing outside the bathroom door in the master bedroom, and I am upstairs in my office.]<br />
Beaner: Daddy, say 'ayudame!'<br />
Al: Say what?<br />
Beaner: Say 'ayudame!'<br />
Al: What do you want me to say?<br />
Me: 'AYUDAME!' Help me!<br />
Al: Oh! Ayudame!<br />
Beaner: Mommy! Can you come help Daddy? He's in the bathroom by himself.
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 100px">&#8212; 01.13.08</span></p>
<p><strong>When I Was a Child</strong><br />
Beaner: A long time ago, I was a grownup and you were a kid?<br />
Me: Were you ever a grownup?<br />
Beaner: I don't think so. I was always a child even when I was big.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 100px">&#8212; 04.23.08, Lunch</span></p>
<p><strong>The Beginning of the Know-It-All Phase</strong><br />
[Scene: All three of us are on the beach in Ocean City, NJ, flying a kite.]<br />
Me: Let's go up on the Boardwalk for a bit.<br />
Beaner: No, let's go up on the BOARD.<br />
Al: Let's go up on the BoardWALK.<br />
Beaner: No, let's go up on the BOARD and WALK.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 100px">&#8212; 05.04.08</span></p>
<p><strong>The Whine and Switch</strong><br />
This is the second time this has happened; I wish I could remember the exact details of the first time. 2nd time:</p>
<p>We were at the Adidas Store, and the Beaner asked to buy a watch. I said no, he didn't need another watch, especially an expensive watch that he couldn't read. He whined and cajoled for a while, then finally agreed that we could put it on his list. I put it back on the rack he whined briefly, and then I went to pay for my shirts.</p>
<p>When we left, he whined under his breath, &quot;I wanna _____.&quot; I couldn't hear what he said, so I had to repeat the statement back to him as a question twice before I heard the last word properly. &quot;I wanna WATCH.&quot; I said, &quot;I don't know what's up with this whiny... CRAP.&quot; He replied, very cheerfully, &quot;No, I mean I wanted to WATCH you buy your shirts!&quot;</p>
<p>The first time, I wasn't <em>sure</em> if he was doing the whine-and-switch. This time, it was absolutely clear.<br />

<h3 class="title">OK, That's Enough</h3>

<p>
Just returned from the People's Party at the Westin, where I did the opposite of what I usually do at parties: I took two photos and talked to at least a dozen people. (Usually I take tons of photos and talk to one or two people.) It was exhilarating, but I think I'm about extrovert-ed out now.... and I kinda want to go home. Hopefully I'll get over that and manage to enjoy three more parties, breakfast with friends on Saturday and Sunday, and other various and sundry meet-ups. Oh, and work tomorrow.

<h3 class="title">Blue Bottle: Cure for the Blues</h3>

<p>
Woke up feeling crappy: dehydrated, sleep-deprived, and with a voice 4 octaves lower than usual. (Thanks to Leah P. for bringing me a glass of water last night; I might have no voice at all otherwise.) Kristin helped set my day on a brighter path by meeting me at 5th &amp; Market, from whence we walked to the relatively new Blue Bottle Cafe on Mint.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2680104414/" title="blue bottle by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3040/2680104414_aa432f790a.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="blue bottle" /></a>
</p>

<p>
If you haven't been to Blue Bottle yet, and you like coffee, get thee there asap. This was one of the best lattes I've ever had, and I drink decaf&#8212;so you can imagine what the real stuff's like.
</p>

<p>
It's fascinating to sit and watch the employees do their thing. The place looks like a chemistry lab, with beakers and pipettes and all kinds of other contraptions for filtering coffee. It's also instructive to watch the barista do his or her thing behind the espresso machine: how precisely the grounds are measured, how carefully the edges of the doodad that holds the grounds are wiped (yeah, I know my coffee paraphernalia, eh?), etc.
</p>

<p>
It was a perfect way to start a gray morning.

<h3 class="title">Waffles and Mussels and Wine, Oh My!</h3>

<p>
Met Kristin and Wisha for breakfast at my old haunt It's Tops! this morning. Last time I visited I had the chocolate chip pancakes, and they were fabu. I think the time before that I might have had eggs. I felt like I was due for a waffle. After briefly considering an egg combo that included a waffle, I decided on the waffle alone&#8212;well, with the addition of whipped cream&#8212;and I wasn't sorry. It was so good that I wondered why I didn't order a waffle every time I came. (In the next second I remembered: equally awesome pancakes, eggs, and toast). The bonus was that by ordering relatively small, I wouldn't be so stuffed that I couldn't eat something else again in a couple hours.
</p>

Wish I'd set the focus better, but I love the shuffling of the coffee cups.
</div>
<p>
San Francisco is such a great eating town, with delicious options ranging from a massive $3.75 vegetarian burrito to three-digits-in-front-of-the-decimal-point tasting menus at world-reknowned restaurants, that it's hard to decide what to eat and easy to eat waaaay too much. On this trip I'd *finally* resigned myself to picking something that looked good when I was hungry, and saving everything else for a future visit rather than trying to get it all in in one go.
</p>
<p>
After quick stops at Photoworks, Wolf Camera, and Safeway (where I couldn't resist the fat bags of cherries for $3.99 a pound, $2 cheaper than I've been able to find them for back home), we turned toward the Mission in search of sun and a working bathroom. We were foiled at our usually-reliable pit stop place; for some reason, the police station at 17th &amp; Valencia was unmanned, and thus the key to the toilet was inaccessible. Good thing I can hold it.
</p>
<p>
In our wanderings in and out of funky antique and furniture stores and the pirate store at 826 Valencia, we passed a place called <a href="http://www.frjtzfries.com/">Frjtz</a> that offered something I've been craving ever since I saw Amalah's episode of Throwdown! with Bobby Flay: MUSSELS. None of us was hungry enough to stop in when we first passed by, but we noted it as the place we'd like to return for lunch. (I surprised myself by not insisting on Mexican food, which is plentiful in the Mission and difficult to find at home.)
</p>
<p>
After much noodling in places that did not offer a bathroom, everyone's stomachs indicated that they were empty enough to accommodate lunch at about the same time that my bladder indicated that it was full enough to cause a scene. We returned to <a href="http://www.frjtzfries.com/">Frjtz</a>, where we spent a few minutes mulling over the mussel choices (I'd been stuck on the idea of blue cheese mussels since the Throwdown!, but wasn't sure if I could get them without the bacon, or, if I could, whether they'd still be worth eating). I decided to ask if it was possible to get the Pompei without the lardons, with the Arles being my backup plan. The sans-lardons Pompei was approved; mine came with fennel as well as shallots, which might not be standard but a flavor substitute for the missing pork. Kristin got the Arles, which is what I would get next time without a doubt. They were exactly what I think of when I think of mussels. Winsha got the Spennes, which were made with Hoegaarden beer instead of the white wine of the Pompei and Arles, and which also contained lemon zest. I liked them, but I preferred the garlic of the Arles to the lemon of the Spennes.
</p>
<p>
I had asked the server who took our orders for a beverage suggestion, and he said, &quot;I'd suggest a nice white wine. Do you like Sauvignon Blanc?&quot; I do, and he was right: The mussels made the wine taste better, and the wine made the mussels taste better. (Winsha also remarked that Pepi made a good Sauv Blanc, so it might have been an exceptional glass of wine anyway.) I forget now whether Winsha had the Leffe and Kristin had the Hoegaarden beer or the other way around; I just remember that Kristin's was the lighter-colored one with the lemon in it. I also got a small order of frites with BBQ sauce (I know, I know, I should have gotten a mayo-based sauce&#8212;I realize my error now&#8212;but I was overwhelmed by the choices, and BBQ is my old standby), which we ended up sharing. The frites were excellent, but definitely eat them hot. We abandoned them when the mussels arrived and returned to them at the end, and they weren't as good cold.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I ate all of my mussels and several of Kristin's (she quit before the bottom of the bowl), so I definitely got my mussel fix. My only quarrel with the meal was the bread: It was sort of Pepperidge Farm consistency where it should have been, IMHO, if not chewy in the peasant-bread style, then at least toasted. Not loving the bread meant not dunking the bread, and that's half the fun of eating mussels.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Of course, not eating the bread meant leaving room, however meager, for treats at Tartine. Well, after a couple laps around the block and a hike up the hill in Dolores Park, plus a pause at the top to catch our breath, let our digestive systems do their things, and admire the view. Note to self: You've had the fresh berry with vanilla cream tart twice in a row now; branch out! Another note to self: Two brownies is not extravagant. Also, they travel well. P.S. to self: If you're going to get the galette, eat it that day.
