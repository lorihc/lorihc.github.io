<h3 class="title">Portland Food Recommendations</h3>

<p>I was all set to write a lovely first-day-of-July post on this month's NaBloPoMo theme of FOOD, but the hotel Internet has gone down, and I'm stuck typing on my iPhone's virtual keyboard with one thumb. I'll come back tomorrow and add links, but for now I just need to recommend a few things to try if you find yourself in Portland, Maine. </p>
<p>Standard Baking Company - At the back of the parking lot next to the Hilton Garden Inn on Commercial Street. Try one of everything, especially the blueberry oatmeal scones, the molasses cookies (get a whole package of those), and the brownies.</p>

<p>Coastal Confections "Rivermill" bar - Dark chocolate with Maine sea salt. Outstanding! Like a chocolate covered pretzel, only with much better chocolate and without the pretzel getting in the way. Available at La Roux kitchen supply on Commercial Street.</p>

<p>The sandwich counter at the Public Market House - I had a grilled cheese on three-seeded bread with cheddar, smoked mozzarella, and tomato, and it was delicious. The market's at 28 Monument Square. </p>

<p>The Merry Table Creperie - I'm not usually a crepe person, but I was lured by the promise of a Nicoise salad and mission figs with mascarpone (the dessert special today). Both were excellent, and the leek, mushroom, and goat cheese crepe I also had was the very definition of savory. The Beaner's berry crepe was delicious, too. The restaurant is on Wharf Street, which is closed to cars.</p>

<p>I haven't eaten in Portland in a long time, but I have had wonderful meals at Fore St and Perfettos. </p>

<p>Sounds delicious!</p>

<p>(The irony is that my in-laws live in Maine, but in such a remote location that the food is... um... <i>not</i> desirable!)</p>

<p>Stop! You are making me jealous with the food talk. The grilled cheese sandwich...want. The crepes too.</p>

<p>Hope you're having fun!</p>
