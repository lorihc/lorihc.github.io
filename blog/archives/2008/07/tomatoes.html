<h3 class="title">Tomatoes</h3>

<p>
Just a quick note to say I ate the first tomatoes from the garden today, and they were TASTY. The Beaner picked a bunch of half-green, half-orange ones without my permission, but he also got one 95% ripe beefsteak tomato and one 90% ripe Sprite grape. I ate the former raw and the latter sliced in a quesadilla.
</p>
<p>
There are several more tomatoes that are likely to be ripe in the next few days... when I will be in San Francisco. I've charged Al with supervising the picking in my absence, and the Beaner now knows that he's not to pick without a parent.
</p>

<p>
Also, I'm having a bit of shoe anxiety in regards to BlogHer and the various parties I'll be attending. There've been so many mentions of "cute shoes" that I'm not sure I'll measure up in my Dansko Marcelles. Ah, well. I'll just wear some striped socks with them and hope for the best. This is how I am, ladies: Not particularly fashionable, but eminently practical. Get used to it.

<p>Your talk of shoes and clothes is making me think it's probably a good idea that I'm not going to be at Blogher. Dressing up for me is wearing a shirt without a hood. Well, except for my <em>fancy</em> shirts with hoods. And the nicest pair of shoes I own right now is a pair of Birkenstocks. </p>
