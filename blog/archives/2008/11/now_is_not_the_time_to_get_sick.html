<h3 class="title">Now Is Not The Time to Get Sick</h3>

<p>
It's the Beaner's 4th birthday today, and it's a bit of a letdown for him after last weekend's party plus visits from his cousin, both sets of grandparents, another set of cousins, and his great-aunt in the past week. For me I think it's kind of a letdown too, in the sense that my body has apparently given up after all the company and planning and baking and whatnot. I'm tired and sweaty and cold and desperately trying to keep my brain and body functioning long enough to pack for my trip to California tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Did I mention that I ordered custom thank-you notes for the Beaner to send out to everyone who gave him a gift at the party last Sunday? In any case, I did, and not surprisingly, they have not arrived yet. This means there'll be a delay in thanking everyone until I get back from California and can help the Beaner write cards.
</p>

<p>
Now that I think of it, that's around the time I should be sending out Christmas cards, so I should probably get on designing those. The good news on that front is that my dad helped me get a good photo of the Beaner (actually three or four good photos) to go on the card. I have no trouble catching a moment when it happens, but I need an assistant when it comes to getting my kid to sit still *and* smile in front of the Christmas tree. Thanks to dad and his elephant impersonations, the session didn't degenerate (entirely) into me shouting "SIT STILL! STOP GLARING AT ME!" while trying not to shake the camera.
</p>

<p>
All right, that's about all I have time for tonight. There's still packing left to do, and a frittata to make, and sleep to get. Ahhh, sleep, how I look forward to thee. I have a big week ahead of me.
</p>
