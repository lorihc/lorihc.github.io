I'm done with elephants and clowns. I want to run away and join the office.

<p>
Happened to catch that lyric when I was running to the bagel place this morning (that went pretty well, btw&#8212;I ran about half the time, walked the rest), and it made me smile. I love when a lyric strikes me as appropos, or possibly even a sign... like when I was dealing with some work angst and ambivalence the other day, and You Can't Get What You Want Til You Know What You Want came on iTunes. 
</p>

<p>
OT: I can't seem to get the smell of fresh bagels out of my nostrils, even after a shower and sitting at my desk for an hour. I may need to go downstairs and raid the stash before tomorrow's brunch.
</p>

<p>
Something else I may need to do: Turn off the e-mail push on my iPhone. For my personal accounts I pull e-mail manually, but for work mail I use push. Unfortunately, I get an e-mail every time the build fails, and I continue to get one in intervals of 1 minute to 15 minutes until the build is fixed. Even with the ringer turned off on my phone, it buzzes audibly, and I finally figured out that getting 75 build failure e-mails between midnight and 7am is not good for maintaining a deep sleep. (I keep the phone next to my bed because I often listen to audiobooks as I drift off to sleep, and because it's my morning alarm.)
</p>

<p>
For the record, though I have broken the build before, I have never broken it before going to bed, and there's nothing I can do to fix it during the night if someone else has broken it or the build machine has run out of space. In short, I do not need to know that the build is broken. I need to sleep. Goodbye, push e-mail.
</p>
