<h3 class="title">E71 Addendum</h3>

<p>
I forgot to mention in my previous installments on the Nokia E71 NAM handset two other things I tried to do with it: namely, connect it to my MacBook and my Dell PC as a mass storage device, and connect to my MacBook via Bluetooth.
</p>
<p>
I probably forgot to mention these things because both were failures. The MacBook didn't recognize the E71 when it was plugged in via USB, even though I'd specifically set the E71 to "mass storage" mode. It wasn't available as a drive, and neither Lightroom nor iPhoto offered to download photos from it. (Neither program was able to browse to it, either.)
</p>

<p>
The PC recgonized it as "new hardware" and correctly identified it as a Nokia E71, but like the MacBook, it did not mount the E71 as a drive, and I couldn't browse the phone's contents with Windows Explorer. I was also unable to import any photos from it with Picasa. (I did not try Lightroom as I was between installations.)
</p>

<p>
I was able to pair the E71 with the MacBook via Bluetooth, but there were no file transfer options. The two devices basically acknowledged that they could see each other and then went their separate ways. 
</p>

<p>
The failure of the Bluetooth and USB transfers is why I ended up uploading all my E71 photos to Flickr via e-mail... and probably why I was extra-annoyed by the "mailbox 'avocado8' in use" and "create WLAN in offline mode?" messages. I saw them a lot more than I would have had I been able to transfer the images to my computer before uploading.

<p>Hi Lori,</p>

<p>With the mac, I use the "data transfer" mode and then the chip of the Nokia device shows up as an external hard drive.</p>

<p>The PC needs the driver for the cable, and thus Nokia's PC Suite is the way to go as it installs the driver.</p>

<p>;o)</p>

<p>(p.s. I think you should ask to review the N82, I think you will like it much better from the photography stand point.)</p>

<p>I think I tried all the modes in an attempt to get it to show up on the Mac, but it's possible I missed that one.</p>

<p>Is it obvious that I'm mostly in this for the photography? :-) I always have at least one camera in my purse (at the moment I have two), but having a cameraphone means that I have a camera with me even when I don't have my purse. That's a very good thing.</p>
