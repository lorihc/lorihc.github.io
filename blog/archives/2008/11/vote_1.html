<h3 class="title">VOTE</h3>

<p>
I do have something I want to write about today, and I still hope to get to it. But I also want to say: PLEASE VOTE. Today if you can, tomorrow if early voting is not available in your state (as is the case here). Take a personal day if you have to. Call in sick if you have to. And please, for the future of our country, our economy, and our people, vote for Obama.

<p>My boss told me that legally you have as much time as you need on election day to vote.  So no sick day needed.   </p>

<p>It depends on where you live. Two references:</p>

<p>One of the many reasons I believe federal elections should be governed by federal law, not by state or local laws.</p>

<p>Also, note that even in the states where time off is given, a maximum of one or two hours is allowed. This may not be enough time in some precincts in this election.</p>

<p>I plan to go to the polls at 10am, and I expect to be in line for less than 30 minutes. I hope things go according to plan. :-)</p>
