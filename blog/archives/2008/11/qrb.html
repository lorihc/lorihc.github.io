<h3 class="title">QRB</h3>

<p>
I know this is my third blog post of the day (so much for forgetting to blog once the in-laws walked in the door!), but I'm so darn touched over this that I have to spew some more.

<p>
I received this tiny little trophy by FedEx today. No note was in the box, but the three little letters in the middle of the inscription were all my heart needed: QRB.
</p>

<p>
QRB stands for Quality Review Board, a term we used on the Dreamweaver team at Macromedia and that's still in use today. (Adobe folks will be more familiar with BRC, which I think stands for Bug Review Council.) In any case, QRB is all about reviewing bugs that have been reproduced by someone in QA/QE (Quality Assurance/Quality Engineering) and determining whether they should be opened (and to whom) or deferred. Sometimes we know that a bug is a duplicate of another, or that it's already been fixed and will be in the next build, and we can get the bugs off the QRB list that way.
</p>

<p>
[See this somewhat related post on Coding Horror that I happened to read today for more on bug categorization and deferral: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001189.html">That's Not a Bug, It's a Feature Request</a>.]
</p>

<p>
QRB used to meet at least three times a week; there were four or five core members who participated in every meeting, and usually two guests (one engineer and one QE) per week. I was one of the core members, and I actually enjoyed QRB. I liked having the 30,000 view of the product, as it were; I had an idea of which features were wonky, which features were relatively stable, where the gaps in our feature (especially legacy feature) knowledge were.
</p>

<p>
I'd just been saying to Al recently that I missed participating in QRB... and then this little trophy arrived, as if to say that QRB missed me, too.
