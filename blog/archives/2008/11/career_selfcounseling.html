<h3 class="title">Career Self-Counseling</h3>

<p>
Do you ever have those moments when you think, "god, I suck! I can't do anything well!"? Well, I had one on Monday. And the bucket of cold water I threw on myself to snap out of it was to think, "that's not true. I'm good at...." Here's the list I came up with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>  Writing JavaScript extensions to Dreamweaver</li>
  <li>    Writing API documentation</li>
  <li>Making shy, introverted, or outcast adults and children feel welcome and included</li>
  <li>Communicating technical concepts to a lay audience</li>
  <li>Learning something one day and then teaching it the next</li>
  <li>Baking</li>
  <li>Facilitating group discussion</li>
  <li>Summarizing a book in 50 words or fewer</li>
  <li>Finding the flaw in any plan</li>
  <li>Writing letters (informative, persuasive, or angry)</li>
  <li>Photographing sports and social events</li>
  <li>Cutting, bleaching, and coloring my own hair</li>
  <li>Selling products or ideas I really believe in</li>
  <li>Refactoring JavaScript</li>
  <li>Acting as a bridge between technical and non-technical people</li>
  <li>Managing a household</li>
  <li>Defending a friend or family member</li>
  <li>Tracking down, documenting, developing tescases for, and finding workarounds for CSS browser bugs</li>
  <li>Remembering how to get places I've been before</li>
  <li>Making my way in a new city
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm going to keep adding to my list over time, as I think of other things I'm good at. It'll serve as a reminder that I don't suck (or at least not completely) when I'm feeling low, and I think it'll also help me figure out what I really want to do. It'd probably also help, career counseling-wise, to make a list of the things I *do* suck at, but I don't think I'm ready for that yet. Soon, soon.
