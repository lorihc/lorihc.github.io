<h3 class="title">Buy This Book</h3>

<p>
Back in January I ordered Shauna Reid's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061657700?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0061657700">The Amazing Adventures of Dietgirl</a> from Amazon UK on the recommendation of a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/momofreaksout/">Flickr acquaintance</a> whose blog I've also been reading for years.
</p>
<p>
Here's what I said about it back then:
</p>

<blockquote>
It's an easy, absorbing, and memorable read; I keep thinking over bits of it, and have read passages out loud to Al. (The story about the Nutella both cracked me up and embarrassed me; while I have no love for Nutella in particular, the scenario of sneaking bits of my husband's treats until I've eaten them all, then replacing them to make amends, and then exploding when he JUST LEAVES THEM THERE IN THE CUPBOARD while they taunt me... well, let's just say it's familiar.) It's not a diet book, but a memoir about dieting, food issues, finding love (of both oneself and another), and getting support that isn't the least bit sappy or self-helpish. It's just wonderfully funny and insightful and fun to readâ€”so go read it. I couldn't think of a single reason not to give it a 10.
</blockquote>

<p>
So why mention it again now? Because <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061657700?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0061657700">Dietgirl</a> is finally scheduled for a U.S. release! No need to order from the UK anymore; you can now pre-order your copy on Amazon.com, and it'll come as a nice little post-Christmas/post-Hanukkah surprise.
</p>

<p>
Please, do it for me. Read this book.
