<h3 class="title">Hunter</h3>

<p>I brought my MacBook with me so I could participate in NaBloPoMo if I decided I was up to it, but the hotel wireless isn't working. Rather than taking that as a sign that I should give up on the notion that I am capable of blogging every day for a month right now, I'm posting from my iPhone. That means no photos, and probably a shorter post than otherwise would have been. <br />
</p>

<p>We're in a hotel because I decided last week that this might be the right weekend to finally visit my grandmother. She has seen many photos of Al and the Beaner, but she'd never met them. (I think the last time I came up to visit I had just gotten pregnant.)</p>

<p>Of course, as soon as I got on the phone with my grandmother to tell her we'd be coming up on Friday night, I realized Friday was Halloween, and we could do no such thing. Rather than disappoint her yet again&#8212;there are no other free weekends until late March&#8212;we formulated plan B: Finish trick-or-treating by 8, get the Beaner ready for bed, throw him in the car, drive halfway to grandma's, and spend the night in a hotel. </p>

<p>[This is where the cute Halloween photo would be if I could copy & paste on an iPhone.]</p>

<p>The second part of Plan B involved driving the rest of the way to my grandmother's house this morning. The Beaner was excited to leave the hotel in NJ and get to grandma's, though he also expressed some apprehension (both "I'm a little afraid" and "I'm a little shy") because he didn't know my grandma. </p>

<p>He ended up enjoying himself quite a bit. He read the Little Golden Books grandma read to me as a kid, he and Al made a snowman in the yard (it melted rapidly once the sun came out, making it look more like a ghost than a snowman by the time we left for dinner), ate grandma's homemade cookies, drew pictures, played Blues Clues with me, diirected grandma what color scrubbers to make for us, and tried to rearrange her furniture.</p>

<p>We had dinner at our hotel's restaurant with grandma, and then I drove her home. We weren't planning to go back over before heading home tomorrow&#8212;I was hoping to take an hour in the morning to show Al around Hunter and take a few photographs&#8212;but I may rethink that now that I've realized that I forgot to take a photo of grandma and the Beaner together. </p>

<p>Whether I get that snap or not, I have no doubt that coming up was the right thing to do. Although the Beaner calls refers to her as "Mommy's grandma" as if she's no relation to him, I think he'll remember the visit. I know she will.   </p>

<h3 class="title">Accidents Will Happen</h3>

<p>At 2:40am on Saturday morning, Al and I were awoken by about six twentysomethings chatting loudly outside our hotel room. Despite two frustrated SHHHes from me and a "dudes! I'm serious! My kid is asleep in here," they didn't shut up until they'd all piled into the room across the hall and gone to sleep themselves.  </p>

<p>When I saw that we were the only guests at this hotel aside from a large wedding group, I figured we were in for another night of the same. </p>

<p>Despite the clocks rolling back an hour, the first loud group came back at 2:35am EST. I couldn't get back to sleep with a semi-full bladder, so I got up to pee. Unfortunately, in the extremely dark room I misjudged where the toilet was by about 3 or 4 inches. I know, it sounds hilarious&#8212;and I'd be laughing right along with you if my back hadn't crashed into the toilet bowl on the way down. </p>

<p>The bruise on my butt from hitting the ceramic tile is nothing compared to the knob-bruise on my spine. It burned for a couple hours, which is how I knew the bruise would be a bad one. I could walk back to the bed, however, so I was pretty sure I hadn't done any serious damage&#8212;and I *was* able to fall asleep with an icepack that Al helpfully fetched for me pressed against my back.</p>

<p>That icepack was still cold when I heard the Beaner yell, "Mom! Where are you?" and responded "in here, buddy!", which woke Al. "Who are you talking to?" he asked. Me: "Oh, I thought I heard the Beaner say, 'Mom, where are you?'" Just then the Beaner made it clear that I wasn't just dreaming by saying loudly, "Mom, I'M WET."</p>

<p>Well, crap. I'd asked Al after the Beaner fell asleep whether he'd peed before getting in bed, and Al had responded that he'd peed after swimming and before getting in the tub. He normally pees before getting in the tub, but we'd had some extra time between bathtime and bedtime, and my mind calculated that he'd been due for one more pee before going to sleep. Add in the fact that we were in a hotel, and it was practically guaranteed that he'd wet the bed. (He hasn't wet the bed at home in six months or more, but he has accidents in probably one out of every three or four hotel rooms.)</p>

<p>The good news is that Al totally took care of everything. He washed down and re-jammied the Beaner, who got in bed with me for a few minutes, and then made up the pull-out couch (this was a lucky stroke; the suite had a queen bed for us, a queen murphy bed&#8212;which the Beaner had been sleeping in&#8212;and a queen sleeper sofa).</p>

<p>It was while the Beaner was snuggling me that the second group of wedding guests tramped noisily down the hall, stealing Privacy Please hangers off of doorknobs (actually, it could have been the first group that had done the stealing; I don't know for sure). I think by this time it was about 3:40am EST. I thought, "thank god for small favors"; they could have easily come when I wasn't already awake, and in that case there might have been another accident in the hallway. An accident involving strangulation by icepack.</p>

<h3 class="title">VOTE</h3>

<p>
I do have something I want to write about today, and I still hope to get to it. But I also want to say: PLEASE VOTE. Today if you can, tomorrow if early voting is not available in your state (as is the case here). Take a personal day if you have to. Call in sick if you have to. And please, for the future of our country, our economy, and our people, vote for Obama.
</p>

<h3 class="title">I Voted!</h3>

<p>
I had an errand to run this morning, and I decided to take a route past my polling place to see how things were going. My plan was to vote at 10am, but if the line was short, I figured I'd duck in.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

</p>

<p>
I don't remember the line ever being out the door. (The room you vote in is at the back of the building.) I wasn't worried about getting in later, after the morning rush, so I was encouraged by the line.
</p>

<p>
After finishing my errand and getting a coffee, I swung back by my polling place to see if the line had diminished. It was no longer out the door&#8212;in fact, I couldn't even see it from the door&#8212;so I stopped to sign a petition to get a traffic signal at 22nd and Cherry and then went inside.
</p>

I was taking the photo above when I heard someone say "hey!", and I looked up to see Al, who'd just finished voting. He assured me that the line would move rather quickly.

my rights, 9:40am
</p>

<p>
It turned out that I and the three people in front of me&#8212;and, I think, the three or four people in front of them&#8212;all had last names that began with A-H, so the volunteer who was working the line took the two guys behind me, who had names that began with R and V, I think, into the voting room to sign in.
</p>

<p>
A couple minutes later I and my fellow A-Hers were led in, and I chatted with a volunteer about the missing hyphen in my last name and the fact that she's always misfiled as well because she goes by her first initial and middle name. She, like most people, blamed the computers; I blamed the people who write the software (or design the databases :-).
</p>

<p>
I didn't have to show ID because I've voted many times before at this polling place, but I signed the book as usual and was told, "you're ready to vote." WOOOO! I had been waiting for this moment for what seems like EVER. I was asked by another volunteer whether I knew how to use the booth, and I said yes. It turned out I was wrong about that, because I accidentally voted NO on a ballot measure on which I'd intended to vote YES, and I couldn't figure out how to change it. I asked for help, and was told that I had to press NO again to clear it. (Weird, huh? I'd been pressing YES over and over.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I finally succeeded in entering all my choices. I can see from the photo below that there was a "straight ticket" option, but I didn't use it. I always vote in each race individually, even if in the end I choose all Democrats. (In the last election I voted for a Republican for City Council, and I've voted for Libertarians, Independents, and Green party candidates as well. I like to read the names and think about what I know of them rather than voting along party lines. This time there weren't any third-party candidates in local races, as far as I can remember, so my choices were fairly straightforward.)
</p>

my ballot, 9:46am
</p>

<p>
I was so excited about photographing my ballot surreptitiously (I'd been told when I asked during the primaries that photography in the voting room was not allowed) that I almost forgot to press the VOTE button. I did remember just as I was turning to leave the booth, and I made sure my vote counted. The only other thing left to do was grab an Obama/Biden sticker (I was sad that there were no I VOTED FOR CHANGE stickers available at my polling place) and make a sign for our front door:

<h3 class="title">Give Him a Hand</h3>

<p>
This morning I am hopeful, nervous, ready to support, ready to sacrifice, ready to work hard. I can't imagine that anyone would want the job Barack Obama has in front of him, but I think (I pray) he's up to the task. I hope that the candidate I saw close out a long campaign with a mixture of seriousness, sobriety, and confidence that TOGETHER WE CAN CHANGE our country will be able to govern effectively, act practically, inspire us to, in the words of John McCain,
</p>

<blockquote>
come together to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.
</blockquote>

<p>
I am hoping that an Obama administration will be good for all Americans, whether they voted for him or not. I am hoping that my friends and family members who could not get behind Obama for reasons of tax policy or religion or race will still benefit from the changes that will come over the next few years. I don't want to shaft anyone. I want everyone&#8212;perhaps those who vilified Obama most of all&#8212;to do well.
</p>

<p>
I hope that Barack Obama spends the next 48-72 hours getting some sleep, and then I hope he reads everything he can get his hands on about the issues that he will face as he takes office. Sponge it up, dude: You're going to need to hit the ground running.
</p>

<p>
Most of all, I hope. Full stop. I HOPE. I thought this series of photographs by <a href="http://electrolicious.com/">Ariel Meadow Stallings</a> captures the mix of emotions&#8212;dominated by hope&#8212;that progressives felt last night when the results came in. It's wonderful.

My friends, let's move forward together. Let's make my hope, our hope, a reality.

<h3 class="title">Observation</h3>

<p>
On Monday morning, Al and I went to the Beaner's school for our first classroom observation of the year. As parents of a returning student, this year we would be allowed into the classroom after 10 minutes. (Last year we spent all 20 minutes looking in through the window.) We lucked out for the outside-the-classroom part: The Beaner was in the front of the classroom, looking for a map.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3007562571/" title="helping a friend by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3218/3007562571_c25e20e681.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="helping a friend" /></a><br />
The Beaner's friend G asks whether the Beaner recognizes the photo on the card he's holding. (The exercise involves identifying the initial vowel sound of the item pictured. Al and I did this exercise during an open house last year, and we found a few of the pictures hard to guess. I missed 'escalator', for example, because I was focused on the woman *on* the escalator.)
</p>

<p>
After helping his friend G with the initial vowel sounds exercise, the Beaner chose a map puzzle and its corresponding laminated map. (He originally chose the South America puzzle and the Europe map by accident, probably because the puzzle and map are matched with colored dots, and he mistook orange for red. We'll have to work on matching up maps at home, where we've actually been talking a lot about the United States and the World&#8212;specifically about Magellan's circumnavigation of the globe. :-)
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3008403260/" title="puzzling out south america by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3002/3008403260_8848ed0dfc.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="puzzling out south america" /></a><br />
The Beaner works at matching the puzzle pieces to the countries on the map.
</p>

<p>
Two other parents with whom we've become friendly were observing their child in the adjacent classroom, and we all started murmuring about our concern that as soon as we entered our respective classrooms, the spell would be broken, and we wouldn't see our kids working as they normally would. I was particularly concerned that the Beaner would just run up and cling to us, forsaking South America.
</p>

<p>
When Ms. Pysher waved us in, however, the other kids seemed more interested in us than the Beaner did. "Hey [Beaner]," said one little boy who was working at a table by the door, "is that your mom and dad?" The Beaner turned, saw us, said, "yeah," gave us a little wave, and went back to his puzzle. I was AMAZED.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3008403906/" title="ms. pysher! ms. pysher! by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3039/3008403906_c5f854319b.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="ms. pysher! ms. pysher!" /></a><br />
In a regular classroom, you'd be hearing "Ms. Pysher! Ms. Pysher!" In this Montessori classroom, you see children tapping Ms. Pysher on the arm and waiting their turns to ask questions, quietly.
</p>

<p>
I'd heard a lot about (and seen for myself) the quiet focus with which the children in a Montessori classroom work, but the last time we observed the Beaner, he was a mess. He couldn't stay on task for more than a minute or two; he rolled on the floor; he dumped beans on his head. In short, he was disruptive and out of control.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3008404552/" title="lots of activity by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3198/3008404552_7d844d74a5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="lots of activity" /></a><br />
With activity going on all around him, the Beaner stays focused on returning the puzzle pieces to their proper spots.
</p>

<p>
My first thought was, THANK YOU, FEINGOLD DIET. (And we're not even doing full-on Feingold! All we've done is eliminate artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives.) I know that's at least part of the difference because we've worked very hard to eliminate the crap from his diet, and thus we're in a position to notice what happens when it accidentally creeps in. For example, when we went to visit my grandmother last weekend, the Beaner was a gem on Saturday: patient, focused, fun to be around. On Sunday morning, we ate at the breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant, where everything turned out to be cooked with artificially-flavored margarine. His behavior took a sharp turn for the worse within an hour: He couldn't focus on anything, he flailed, he didn't listen or respond when we called his name. I had to give him my "you got artificial flavors this morning, so you're going to have to work harder to listen and control your body today" speech to get 5 minutes of sitting still, and even then he spent the entire 5 minutes plucking at his neck (his calming gesture).
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3008405114/" title="putting the pieces back by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3284/3008405114_67575477af.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="putting the pieces back" /></a><br />
A student spreads out a mat for himself while Ms. Pysher helps A.M. with a sorting exercise, and the Beaner finishes returning his puzzle pieces to their proper places.
</p>

<p>
I think the other factor in his calm and focus in the classroom is that this is his second year. This I inferred from watching the new 3 year-olds (the Beaner's still considered a 3 year-old this year because his birthday's not until the end of this month, though he's a "returning" 3 year-old). They had some of the same focus problems that the Beaner struggled with last year. They weren't necessarily disruptive; they just lost interest in whatever they were doing before the task was complete, and started fooling around.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3007565665/" title="matching initial vowel sounds by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/3007565665_a43b8ab5ab.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="matching initial vowel sounds" /></a><br />
Matching initial vowel sounds.
</p>

<p>
The Beaner did a bit of his own fooling around, I suspect for Al's benefit, when he moved on to the initial vowel sounds exercise that G.L. had just completed. He still managed to stay with his mat and his task, though, which just plain knocked my socks off. I was SO PROUD.

<p>
When we turned to leave, the Beaner finally came over and gave us each a hug and a kiss, and we told him we'd see him later. "OK," he said, and went back to his work.

<h3 class="title">Won't Talk About It</h3>

<p>
I have a bunch of things I want to talk about, but all of them would [a] take too long, and [b] expose too much. It might be painfully obvious, or it might be news to everyone who reads this, but I am a bit uneasy about my public persona. On the one hand, I enjoy sharing here as part catharsis, part family holiday letter, part YOU ARE NOT ALONE billboard. On the other hand, I'm not entirely comfortable knowing that someone might actually, you know, READ what I've written.
</p>

<p>
I guess I like to think of myself as some anonymous Wife Mother Writer Coder Winger (as my MOO cards advertise), connecting with close friends and family at one end of the spectrum, and like-minded strangers on the other. What makes me decidedly uncomfortable is either becoming a celebrity whom others think they know (archetype: <a href="http://www.dooce.com/">dooce</a>), or (the more likely scenario) becoming sorta kinda well-known for the work I do. 
</p>

<p>
If you're a regular reader, you probably have no idea what I'm talking about with that somewhat-more-likely scenario, because I don't talk about work here very often. Here's a little background: While I used to work on a much more famous product with a much larger user base than I do now, I enjoyed some amount of anonymity in working for a large company. I might have been famous&#8212;or at least familiar&#8212;among our internal beta testers, but otherwise, nobody really knew or cared what I did for a living. Most people assume that the Dreamweaver hoodie I wear almost daily is a reference to the Gary Wright song of the same name, and never give it a second thought.
</p>

<p>
The job I'm in now is different in a few ways, namely: [a] I'm working for a much smaller company (i.e., there's nowhere to hide); [b] because we're small, produce open-source products, and don't have a giant advertising budget, everyone's responsible for some amount of guerrilla marketing; and [c] it's my job to work closely, personally, with Ajax framework developers on a win-win-win (for them, for us, and for our users) proposition: getting support for their frameworks into one of our products.
</p>

<p>
So, why is this a problem? Well, mostly it's not; I like win-win-win propositions, I like being in a position to make developers' lives easier (both framework developers' and web developers'), and I like solving technical and process problems. What I'm not so comfortable with is putting myself out there. I don't like asking people for things. I don't like forcing myself on anyone. And, as I said above, I'm not entirely sure I want anyone who's not already in my inner circle to really know what I'm doing, thinking, saying, or photographing. This is why my Twitter updates are protected, why my photos of the Beaner on Flickr are Friends and Family only, why I have gazillions of MOO cards but hardly ever hand them out. I *think* I want to put myself out there, but when it comes right down to it, I really don't.
</p>

<p>
Thus the minor freakout when, after releasing an updated plugin for one of the Ajax frameworks we support last month and being reminded by our marketing director to ask the developers of said framework to blog about the release, my contact responded with a lovely post about the work I'd personally done... and linked my name back to this here blog. Now, perhaps no one will read the post (unlikely). And perhaps no one will click on the link to find out who the hell Lori Hylan-Cho is (likely). But all of sudden, my professional life was connected to my very personal blog in a way that set off all my Oh My God I'm OUT THERE alarms. 
</p>

<p>
The first thing I did when I saw the post (which I'm not going to link to lest trackbacks are on and I end up making things much, much worse) was come over here to make sure that nothing entirely crazy or frightfully personal was on the front page. And even though I haven't stopped writing&#8212;I'm sort of stealth-participating in NaBloPoMo this month, in fact&#8212;I've been thinking a lot lately about what I say and how I say it. I'm self-censoring even more than usual. You might even have noticed that I haven't mentioned the name of the company for which I work, nor the name of the product I work on, even though both are public knowledge and have been mentioned on this blog before. Why? Because if I mention the name, this post will show up in a Google alert for that word that many in my company (including me) get every day. That's EXACTLY the scenario I'm trying to avoid (among others).
</p>

<p>
So I'm not sure how to end this gracefully, as I didn't intend to write all that I did when I started, and I'm writing directly in the Movable Type web interface. (Usually I write in Dreamweaver when I've got a lengthy post in mind, so I can organize my thoughts better and see everything I've written at once.) I guess I just wanted to put it out there that I'm not comfortable with putting it out there. And I think it's starting to show... which is not what I want.
</p>

<p>
&lt;le sigh&gt;

<h3 class="title">BarCamp Philly</h3>

<p>
I got up early to come to BarCamp Philly this morning, knowing there was a 99% chance I wouldn't present anything. So far, I'm on track with that prediction. There are several topics I *could* speak about&#8212;CSS, JavaScript, development process, learning to play ice hockey, how to color your own hair&#8212;but none I'm *prepared* to speak about, at least formally.
</p>

<p>
Informally, sure. I keep thinking about my friend Kin, who assured me that he was incapable of speaking in front of a crowd and then fielded questions with ease from the front row of my presentation at MAX last year. He was fine as long as he wasn't on a stage with a microphone and a podium and slides because he was <em>just talking</em> with other geeks. That's how I feel today; I'll be fine as long as I'm <em>just talking</em> and not presenting.
</p>

<p>
Maybe next year I'll get up the gumption to present on something. Maybe I'll even prepare some slides ahead of time. That's how it usually happens: I see a bunch of presentations, think "I can do that [or better than that]," and confidence blooms. (It usually goes out the window in the 48 hours leading up to the presentation, but at least by then I have a speaking slot, some slides, and an idea of what I'm going to say.)
</p>

<p>
It's hard to say whether I'm more reserved than usual; I have this sense that I used to be like this all the time, and then I felt more comfortable with myself and my knowledge, and now I'm back to feeling shy and insecure...though maybe shy and insecure has always been the norm. No, I take that back. <em>Arrogant</em> and insecure has always been the norm, according to my mom.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Warning: New Phase Approaching</h3>

<p>
The Beaner has been such a gem since school started at the beginning of September. I've given credit to the Feingold Diet for this golden behavior, but I probably haven't given enough credit to his new nanny, Shawna. They have a great relationship, and he really seems to be blooming under her care&#8212;not least because the two of them talk to each other all day long. It sounds simple and obvious, but <em>she talks to him.</em> She doesn't scold him like a parent or herd him like a sheep; she engages him in conversation. It's a small thing that makes a big difference. 
</p>

<p>
Having said that, however, I think the honeymoon is almost over, and a new phase is imminent. I can see it in a little extra clinginess, a little less body control, and the huge leap he's made lately in language development. Now, I only have a little less than four years of experience in anticipating phases, but in those four years I have noticed, almost entirely in hindsight, that when a developmental leap forward happens, an emotional step back also occurs. Add in a dose of change (e.g., starting school, getting a new nanny&#8212;no matter how great either of them are), and there's a storm coming.
</p>

<p>
If I'm right, and I'm finally anticipating a new phase rather than living through it and only *then* identifying it, the question now becomes: Does this foreknowledge help in any way? Can I help make the recession, as it were, shorter and shallower? I hope so. If nothing else, I can be more patient. I can take him aside and talk to him. I can assure him that I'm not going anywhere, that Daddy and I absolutely love him, and, as Al and I told him tonight, with increased ability comes increased responsibility.
</p>

<p>
He wasn't too clear on this concept, so I explained that as his brain and his body get bigger and he's able to do more things, he also has to build up his self-control muscles in order to be able to support the bigger body and bigger brain. He has to work harder to put his new abilities to good use (and to not put them to silly, hurtful, or otherwise negative use). I think he got a little of the idea,  at least; it's a message I plan to repeat in as many ways as I can think of, while also telling him how proud I am of the big words he's using correctly, of the art he's producing, of the human being he's becoming. And as I say these things to him, I'll also be reminding myself what a great kid I have, no matter how badly things seem to be going at that moment. I hope it works, for all of us.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Wrong!</h3>

<p>
I've been informed that the kid clinginess I've been experiencing is not because a new phase is approaching&#8212;it's because I don't spend enough time with my son. Apparently I don't snuggle him enough, play with him enough, talk to him enough. Good to know!

<p>
Can somebody tell me why this is my most-viewed Flickr photo of all time? It consistently gets 5-8 views a day, and almost all references to it are from within Flickr, not from outside sites or search engines. Is it coming up in Flickr photo searches? Do the members of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/49503134345@N01/">Graffiti group</a> dive that deeply into the pool? I have no idea. Do you?

<h3 class="title">I, Too, Am Psychic</h3>

<p>
I had a <a href="http://www.fussy.org/2008/10/i-am-psychic.html">Mrs. Kennedy moment</a> this morning. I woke up, rolled over, and thought, "I wonder if I'm ever going to meet <a href="http://juliloquy.typepad.com/">juliloquy</a> in person." I thought about the missed connections at the playground&#8212;when we said we'd be there after tee ball and then ended up skipping tee ball&#8212;and how I'd run into HPR once at Trader Joe's, but Julie and I never seemed to run into one another, despite visiting the same places frequently.
</p>

<p>
So I lay there thinking this, and then I got up and started my day. Did some work. Had some good ideas. Did some more work. Then left the house to meet my husband for lunch in the basement of the Comcast building.
</p>

<p>
I got there first, so I started checking out the food offerings... when suddenly who should walk up and say, "hi!" but Julie. I felt like I'd imagined her into being with my early-morning wishful thinking. Aside from that, it was a totally normal encounter. Julie mentioned that she felt like she already knew me, and I felt the same way. I got another chance to interact with the super-sweet Roo (who'd been at TJs with her dad), and to meet the Shmoo (we shook hands), and we talked about potential playdates and the fact that the Shmoo and the Beaner are a very similar size and shape (they're also 3 weeks apart in age).
</p>

<p>
I'm already looking forward to the next time we meet up&#8212;and next time I won't be leaving it to wishful thinking or chance encounters. I'm going to e-mail Julie and make a date.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Career Self-Counseling</h3>

<p>
Do you ever have those moments when you think, "god, I suck! I can't do anything well!"? Well, I had one on Monday. And the bucket of cold water I threw on myself to snap out of it was to think, "that's not true. I'm good at...." Here's the list I came up with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>  Writing JavaScript extensions to Dreamweaver</li>
  <li>    Writing API documentation</li>
  <li>Making shy, introverted, or outcast adults and children feel welcome and included</li>
  <li>Communicating technical concepts to a lay audience</li>
  <li>Learning something one day and then teaching it the next</li>
  <li>Baking</li>
  <li>Facilitating group discussion</li>
  <li>Summarizing a book in 50 words or fewer</li>
  <li>Finding the flaw in any plan</li>
  <li>Writing letters (informative, persuasive, or angry)</li>
  <li>Photographing sports and social events</li>
  <li>Cutting, bleaching, and coloring my own hair</li>
  <li>Selling products or ideas I really believe in</li>
  <li>Refactoring JavaScript</li>
  <li>Acting as a bridge between technical and non-technical people</li>
  <li>Managing a household</li>
  <li>Defending a friend or family member</li>
  <li>Tracking down, documenting, developing tescases for, and finding workarounds for CSS browser bugs</li>
  <li>Remembering how to get places I've been before</li>
  <li>Making my way in a new city
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm going to keep adding to my list over time, as I think of other things I'm good at. It'll serve as a reminder that I don't suck (or at least not completely) when I'm feeling low, and I think it'll also help me figure out what I really want to do. It'd probably also help, career counseling-wise, to make a list of the things I *do* suck at, but I don't think I'm ready for that yet. Soon, soon.

<h3 class="title">Just Because You Can Shop Online Doesn't Mean You're a Geek</h3>

<p>
Thanks to <a href="http://www.molly.com/">Molly</a> for getting me all steamed about this via Twitter: <a href="http://nostarch.oreilly.com/">No Starch Press</a>, a subsidiary of famed technical book publisher O'Reilly, has just published <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781593271879/">How to Be a Geek Goddess</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Is it a book about how to hone your hacker skills? How to leverage your already-hefty technical knowledge and computer science training to become a respected leader in the tech community? Not if the book's description is anything to go by.
</p>

<blockquote>
In How to Be a Geek Goddess, author Christina Tynan-Wood shares the expertise she gained while writing for magazines like PC World and PC Magazine but keeps the book light and conversational. Like advice from the geek girlfriends you always wished you had, the book explains topics in a way you'll understand: No patronizing guy bluster, unnecessary jargon, or information you aren't interested in, just the stuff you need to know to get the job done. You'll learn how to use your computer to get more done in less time, shop for gear, fit an ugly computer into a lovely living room, hang out in online communities, and keep yourself and your family safe online. Tynan-Wood covers basic and not-so-basic topics, like how to use VoIP to make inexpensive telephone calls over the Internet and set up a wireless network in your home.
</blockquote>

<p>
This is not a book about how to become a geek goddess, because being able to shop online or match a laptop to your living room's decor do not make you a geek. They make you a 21st century human or an interior decorator, respectively. You don't need to be an expert in technology to reboot your computer, but you do need to be expert in and passionate about something&#8212;preferably something technical&#8212;in order to be considered a geek.
</p>

<p>
Seems to me that the title of the book should have been The Goddess' Guide to Using and Talking Tech, because it's aimed at women who already think of themselves as goddesses. To be a *Geek* Goddess, you have to be a geek first.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Buy This Book</h3>

<p>
Back in January I ordered Shauna Reid's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061657700?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0061657700">The Amazing Adventures of Dietgirl</a> from Amazon UK on the recommendation of a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/momofreaksout/">Flickr acquaintance</a> whose blog I've also been reading for years.
</p>

<p>
Here's what I said about it back then:
</p>

<blockquote>
It's an easy, absorbing, and memorable read; I keep thinking over bits of it, and have read passages out loud to Al. (The story about the Nutella both cracked me up and embarrassed me; while I have no love for Nutella in particular, the scenario of sneaking bits of my husband's treats until I've eaten them all, then replacing them to make amends, and then exploding when he JUST LEAVES THEM THERE IN THE CUPBOARD while they taunt me... well, let's just say it's familiar.) It's not a diet book, but a memoir about dieting, food issues, finding love (of both oneself and another), and getting support that isn't the least bit sappy or self-helpish. It's just wonderfully funny and insightful and fun to read—so go read it. I couldn't think of a single reason not to give it a 10.
</blockquote>

<p>
So why mention it again now? Because <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061657700?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0061657700">Dietgirl</a> is finally scheduled for a U.S. release! No need to order from the UK anymore; you can now pre-order your copy on Amazon.com, and it'll come as a nice little post-Christmas/post-Hanukkah surprise.
</p>

<p>
Please, do it for me. Read this book.

<h3 class="title">Grumpy</h3>

<p>God, I've had a grumpy day. Started out well, as I recall, but somewhere along the line I got even more irritable than usual, and I couldn't keep my head. I spent much of the day stewing over a dream I had last night&#8212;oh, and stewing apples. I'm attempting to make apple butter, at Al's request. </p>

<p>Anyway, it seemed like a good day at first, despite the thunderstorms and warmish temperatures (in November!), but now I'm just grumpy. Al's just turned on Juno, though; hoping that will be entertaining enough to break the spell.  </p>

<h3 class="title">Review/Preview</h3>

<p>
I'm mostly posting tonight to say that the meatier posts will happen sometime during the week, if possible. Here's what's on my to-blog list:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Nokia E-71 NAM review<br />
WOM World/Nokia sent me an E71 to try out two weeks ago with the provision that I tell them and any readers of my blog what I thought about it. I want to make sure I do that before I forget what my thoughts are. (Ideally, I would have done it before sending the handset back, but I don't think I'm going to get to it before tomorrow.)</li>

<li>Parent-Teacher Conference<br />
We had a nice one on Friday.</li>

<li>The Downside of Working From Home<br />
I've got this post mostly written, but I want to add a few more observations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the meantime, I'm happy to report that today was a better day (if not a stellar day), partly because of the change in weather, partly because I played hockey, and partly because the apple butter came out so great. Al says it's the best he's ever had, which is both good and bad&#8212;good because it brings a measure of pride, and bad because I'm not sure I could duplicate the effort. I did approximately this:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Sliced 2 Staymans, 2 Crispins (I think), and four or five Empires that were no longer crunchy as thinly as I could with a dull knife, and without peeling or coring them first.</li>
<li>Stuffed the sliced apples into a 4 (or 5?) quart crock pot with a couple tablespoons of water.</li>
<li>Set the crock pot on high for, uh, two hours? Four hours? I'm not sure.</li>
<li>Lowered the heat on the crock pot (to Low, of course) for another couple hours. Or maybe just one hour.</li>
<li>Ran the results through a hand-cranked food mill.</li>
<li>Poured the resulting 5.5 cups of sauce back into the crock pot.</li>
<li>Added 2 slightly-heaping cups of organic cane sugar (based on a recipe I'd read that said 1/2 cup sugar for every 1 cup sauce), 2 heaping tablespoons cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves + however much more dumped over the sides when a clump detached itself from the mass at the bottom of the jar.</li>
<li>Stirred, tasted the result, and nearly keeled over from the sweetness.</li>
<li>Dumped in the remaining unsweetened, chunky applesauce that I'd made last fall, frozen, and thawed earlier this week. It was a mix of Cortland, Macintosh, and Pink Lady apples.</li>
<li>Tasted again, then dug through the freezer looking for more unsweetened applesauce. Found an unlabeled jar (which means it was either from 2007 or 2006), thawed it in the microwave, and dumped it into the crockpot.</li>
<li>Stirred, tasted, and added maybe a 1/2 cup white vinegar (possibly less). Vinegar was also in the recipe that gave the .5:1 sugar:sauce ratio, and I figured maybe the sugar and vinegar offset each other.</li>
<li>Stirred again, put two butter knives on top of the crock pot, balanced the lid on the knives, and set the pot to Low.</li>
<li>Went to bed.</li>
<li>In the morning, removed the knives, stirred (well, I stirred first, knocked both knives into the apple butter, and *then* removed the knives), turned off the pot, and replaced the cover.</li>
<li>Went out to a kid birthday party in New Jersey and a hockey game in Delaware.</li>
<li>Upon returning at 6pm, attempted to preserve what I'd made (3 pint jars' worth plus a little extra) using a boiling water bath, but I screwed up a few steps. I'm still not sure whether all the jars will seal; if not, I'll freeze them.</li>

<h3 class="title">Good Thing I'm Not Pregnant</h3>

<p>
I'm still working on the Working at Home post, so I'll just say here that tonight's hockey practice KICKED ASS, and that I hope I'll have a chance to write about it and other recent hockey adventures tomorrow. I already have a title for the post picked out: IN WHICH I GET ALL WAGGLY.
</p>

<p>
The only not-so-great thing that happened at practice tonight is that I fell forward while reaching for a puck, and I landed in such a way that my pelvic protector not only didn't protect my pelvis, but it also injured it. OW. All I could think of was, "wow, good thing I'm not pregnant." I'm *still* sore in the spot where my C-section scar is, even two hours later.

<h3 class="title">The Director Dream</h3>

<p>
Last night I dreamed that I was directing a movie. The dream started <em>en medias res</em> (do all dreams start that way? probably, but in this one, I felt like I'd been dropped into the scene); I was standing on a patch of ground outside a house, and there was a film crew behind me. On the large covered porch of the house were several actors.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure how I knew it, but I knew that the crew didn't have much faith in me. They didn't seem to think I was qualified to be a director, or that I knew what I was doing at all. I wasn't sure that their distrust and lack of faith was misplaced, as I wasn't sure what I was doing there or if I could manage the situation, either.
</p>

<p>
I walked over to the porch and addressed the actors (can't remember what I said), then called for the cameras to roll. I watched the scene unfold, and thought to myself, "these are either the worst actors ever, or the script is the worst ever&#8212;or both." The scene was terrible: Long, meaningless, ill-delivered. I watched in horror, wondering when it would end, forgetting that I had the power to yell "cut!"
</p>

<p>
I thought I heard a voice in the distance say "cut", so I turned toward it, and, not seeing anything, yelled "cut!" myself. It turned out I wasn't imagining things; it was one of the technicians in a trailer who'd said "cut". He came out and told me that we were about to lose the light. I said "OK," and that we should go again right away.
</p>

<p>
Just as we began shooting again, we did indeed lose the light&#8212;it became pitch black incredibly fast. The dream sort of became more confused at that point; I remember trying to feel my way to the porch, and I ended up on the outside of a small room with glass walls (like a conference room in the center of an office building), watching the actors from outside. The room was well-lit, but where I was standing remained pitch black, and they couldn't see or hear me.
</p>

<p>&lt;/end_dream&gt;</p>

<h3 class="title">Adventures with thE E71, Part 1</h3>

<p> My plan for this evening was to sit down and write a comprehensive review of my two-week trial with the Nokia E71 NAM handset, but upon emerging from the Beaner's bedroom, I discovered a pile of work awaiting me in my Inbox. It's now 10:28pm, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get to everything I wanted to talk about in one go. I'm going to give it 30 minutes, and then I'll post what I've got. If I'm not finished, I'll write more tomorrow. Here goes...</p>


<p>First things first: Since my regular phone is an iPhone, I didn't have a SIM card to use with the E71. WOM World said they could send me one with the phone, and <a href="http://www.blackphoebe.com/">Ms. Jen</a> suggested that I could pick up a pay-as-you-go card from a T-Mobile store, but I did not end up making the trip to the T-Mobile store when no SIM card arrived with the phone. Thus it was no use to me as an actual phone, so I have no idea what the call quality is like. </p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3042072467/" title="Nokia E71NAM (left) and Apple iPhone (right) by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3171/3042072467_e51140ae08.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Nokia E71NAM (left) and Apple iPhone (right)" /></a><br />
The Nokia E71 (left) and my iPhone (right). They're of comparable size; both fit easily into my pocket.
</p>
<p>I did, however, use the E71 in situations where I would normally use my iPhone&#8212;namely, for taking photos, sending e-mails, uploading photos to Flickr *by* e-mail, taking notes, and browsing the web. Well, I only browsed the web twice; once to see what this website looked like in the E71's browser, and once to Google something. The web browsing experience wasn't all that thrilling, though, so I found myself just using my iPhone without even considering that the E71 was also in my pocket.</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3042913958/" title="avocado8 on the E71 by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3065/3042913958_6755a017f7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="avocado8 on the E71" /></a><br />
I wish I'd taken this with my Canon 870; it does better in low light than my iPhone (incidentally, so does the E71, but it could not be both camera and subject). In any case, this is the main page of avocado8 on the E71. As you can see, the two-column layout has been jettisoned, I assume for easier reading.
</p>
<p>On November 7 I took the E71 (and the iPhone, since I wanted to listen to podcasts) on my morning walk. It was a blustery, gray morning with occasional light drizzle&#8212;not ideal circumstances for testing a cameraphone, but real circumstances. I figured that the E71 might even do better than the iPhone under these conditions, since it has a flash (or a light that comes on when you're taking a photo, anyway). Of course, as with any built-in flash, it doesn't do much outdoors if the subject of the photo is more than a few feet away.</p>
<p>I started with a fall foliage shot, followed by a standard morning walk self-portrait.</p>

</p>
<p>When I reached the Schuylkill Banks trail, I took my iconic bridge shot (the thumbnail versions were taken with my Vivitar IC101 panoramic):

</p>
<p>Next, I did a side-by-side comparison: I held the E71 in my left hand, and the iPhone in my right, and I took a photo with each.</p>
<p class="pictureP" id="twotrees">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3036415995/" title="11072008005.jpg by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3142/3036415995_c0ed0a8c56.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="yellow tree, with E71" /></a>

E71 (left/top), iPhone (right/bottom)<br /></p>
<p>Neither of the photos have been edited. If you view them both large (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3036415995/sizes/l/">E71</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3042130439/sizes/l/">iPhone</a>), you can see which details get lost. You may also notice what I did, right away: That the iPhone naturally took the tree in vertical format, while the E71 went with horizontal. It never occurred to me to tilt the E71, as I recall.</p>
<p>Annnnnnd.... that's where I'll have to leave this for the night, as I completely blew through my 30 minute limit and am now in danger of missing the midnight deadline for posting (for NaBloPoMo purposes). To be continued!</p>

<h3 class="title">Adventures With the E71, Part 2</h3>

<p> OK, resuming my E71 review where I left off, with the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2008/11/adventures_with_the_e71_part_1.html#twotrees">two trees</a>: There are obviously differences between the two images (aside from the obvious orientation difference); the color's a bit different, and the image is less sharp in different spots, but overall I'd say the quality is about equivalent.</p>

<p>The next test was a closeup. The iPhone SUCKS at closeups... but seemingly not as badly as the E71, if this side-by-side test is any indication (E71 is first, iPhone second, in case you can't tell from the orientation). At least in the iPhone photo, the leaves are in focus; in the E71 photo, nothing is. The E71's color is more correct, though, if a bit on the cool side.</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3037272666/" title="closeup: vote (E71) by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/3037272666_c87e716e6f.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="closeup: vote (E71)" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3044802064/" title="closeup: vote (iPhone) by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3044/3044802064_a7f5388e5b.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="closeup: vote (iPhone)" /></a>
</p>
<p>
Just for shits and giggles, here are the same two photos after running the Auto White Balance and Auto Tone commands in Lightroom.
</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3044816810/" title="E71, color-corrected by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3235/3044816810_d80aaacf77.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="E71, color-corrected" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3044817144/" title="iPhone, color-corrected by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3241/3044817144_9b444af445.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="iPhone, color-corrected" /></a>
</p>
<p>I think the final verdict is that the E71 would work fine as a cameraphone; it's not great in all situations, but it's no worse than my old Razr, and the flash is handy for indoor shots in dim light. (It's not so great for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3036466659/">self-portraits</a>, however.) Before I move on to the thing I most liked about the phone&#8212;and the things that most annoyed me&#8212;here's one more shot from the E71:</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3043992241/" title="pumpkin, color corrected by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3293/3043992241_7d6cb00332.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="pumpkin, color corrected" /></a>
<br />
I color-corrected this one in Lightroom. The original was dimmer and cooler and flatter.
</p>
<p>So what did I like most about the E71? The physical keyboard, hands down (no pun intended). While I did poke the screen several times out of habit, I found that the physical keys made it much easier to type with both thumbs at once, and therefore to type faster. For the most part typing was also intuitive; it only took me a couple tries to figure out the shift and special character keys (although I did have to hunt for the parentheses in a menu, if I recall correctly), and I made fewer typos.</p>
<p>The list of what I didn't like is quite a bit longer, I'm afraid. I didn't enjoy going back to endless menus and cryptic icons after a year of using the ultra-intuitive iPhone. None of the options made sense to me, and putting options on both the main screen and in menus controlled by buttons at the bottom of the screen did not work for me at all. I also hated that the screen did not light up long enough for me to read it when the phone was locked (a state I never did figure out how to get *into*, as occasionally the phone would remain unlocked for hours, and other times it would lock itself after a few minutes). It was giving me instructions on how to unlock the thing, but I couldn't read the dim text. I finally deduced that it was saying &quot;press Unlock and then [any key, I think]&quot;, but after a couple of minutes of looking and trying random keys, I shouted &quot;WHERE IS THE UNLOCK BUTTON????&quot; at it. I finally noticed, after pressing buttons randomly and seeing the instructions flash and then dim for about the 20th time, that Unlock was the on-screen menu in the lower-left corner, and I managed to get the thing unlocked. Granted, this is likely only going to be a problem the first time you use the phone, because once you understand the key combination, it's easy to repeat. As I mentioned, however, it's not always clear what *locks* the phone, so you could end up trying to unlock when you don't need to.</p>
<p>Next up for needling is the wireless access. Now, I can't say that the iPhone has this down, either; I find I'm often interrupted when walking around with prompts to join a wireless network that I then have to dismiss, or worse, that the iPhone joins a network that it thinks is &quot;trusted&quot; (because my neighbor, whose wireless signal is stronger in the downstairs half of our house than ours is&#8212;and I suspect the reverse is true, since our WAP is upstairs&#8212;never renamed his network from the default &quot;linksys&quot;, and neither did many other people) but is actually WEP-enabled or otherwise closed to me. When that happens, I often have to turn off wireless in the Settings *and* restart the iPhone in order to get it to reset properly. Otherwise, no mail.</p>
<p>The E71 goes about wireless access in the opposite manner that the iPhone does (or maybe it just felt opposite to me because I could never get it to *check* my mail, only send). You write your e-mail, and when you click Send, only *then* does it check for wireless access points. You have to choose one from a menu of options, and then the most infuriating thing happens: You're asked whether you want to create a WLAN connection in offline mode. </p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3044901930/" title="searching for available access points... by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3137/3044901930_a0b9ff4643.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="searching for available access points..." /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3044065391/" title="create WLAN connection in offline mode? by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3166/3044065391_fb8806c281.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="create WLAN connection in offline mode?" /></a></p>
<p>ARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH! I'm sure this only happens to those of us who are using the phone without a SIM card (i.e., me), but it drove me NUTS. This is how I managed to get so frustrated with the menus and icons, actually&#8212;in searching for a way to say YES, I *ALWAYS* WANT TO CREATE A WLAN CONNECTION IN OFFLINE MODE. (I never did find it.)</p>
<p>[For those of you who are about to tell me to RTFM, I did. I found it to be singularly useless.]</p>
<p>What I would have preferred is [a] if the wireless access point I last used is still available, just use that automatically, or [b] if I must choose a WAP, then just connect to the damn thing already and let's get this show on the road. Do not leave question up on the screen, waiting for me to respond.</p>
<p>Speaking of leaving messages up on the screen, this was another of my non-favorites:</p>
<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3044900638/" title="mailbox 'avocado8' in use by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3210/3044900638_3bce6557eb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="mailbox 'avocado8' in use" /></a><br />
Yes, I *know*.
</p>
<p>Again, to be fair, the iPhone didn't figure this one out in version 1.0 of its software, either. Often when reading mail, I'd create a new message, only to discover many hours later that it'd been sent from my default mail account rather than the account of the mailbox I'd been in. Apple fixed this in version 2.0; I can now specify from which account to send right from within an e-mail. The E71 could benefit from such a feature. Having to stare at an informational message that I have no idea how to dismiss for several seconds every time I want to send an e-mail is crazy. Why not just include a from line, and let me change the account there if necessary?</p>
<p>Overall I'd say that the E71 is likely to be a hit with Blackberry fans; it's small, it has a decent camera, and it has a familiar and easy-to-use keyboard. Compared with my husband's Blackberry, however, the interface is harder to grok (for me at least), though I did prefer the large central button for navigation and selection to the Blackberry's side selection button. Against the iPhone, however, I'm afraid it doesn't compare well, especially for those users who've gotten used to the virtual keyboard and all the other on-screen selection and navigation techniques. Apple hasn't gotten everything right, even with version 2.0 of the iPhone software, but they made the most common tasks so intuitive&#8212;and the somewhat less-common tasks only slightly more difficult to find&#8212;that I've never once opened my manual. (Did I even get a manual?) Heck, I didn't even notice that copy and paste weren't possible until about a month in, since Apple had covered the most common usage scenarios so well.</p>
<p>So: Nokia E71. Nice phone. No iPhone.</p>

<h3 class="title">E71 Addendum</h3>

<p>
I forgot to mention in my previous installments on the Nokia E71 NAM handset two other things I tried to do with it: namely, connect it to my MacBook and my Dell PC as a mass storage device, and connect to my MacBook via Bluetooth.
</p>

<p>
I probably forgot to mention these things because both were failures. The MacBook didn't recognize the E71 when it was plugged in via USB, even though I'd specifically set the E71 to "mass storage" mode. It wasn't available as a drive, and neither Lightroom nor iPhoto offered to download photos from it. (Neither program was able to browse to it, either.)
</p>

<p>
The PC recgonized it as "new hardware" and correctly identified it as a Nokia E71, but like the MacBook, it did not mount the E71 as a drive, and I couldn't browse the phone's contents with Windows Explorer. I was also unable to import any photos from it with Picasa. (I did not try Lightroom as I was between installations.)
</p>

<p>
I was able to pair the E71 with the MacBook via Bluetooth, but there were no file transfer options. The two devices basically acknowledged that they could see each other and then went their separate ways. 
</p>

<p>
The failure of the Bluetooth and USB transfers is why I ended up uploading all my E71 photos to Flickr via e-mail... and probably why I was extra-annoyed by the "mailbox 'avocado8' in use" and "create WLAN in offline mode?" messages. I saw them a lot more than I would have had I been able to transfer the images to my computer before uploading.
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Downsides of Working at Home</h3>

<p>
As regular readers will know, I work at home. I've been working at home since 2004&#8212;first as a contractor, and then, starting in 2006, full-time. One of the conditions under which I took this new job was that I'd continue to work from home. (I already had a job that I really liked and for which I could move back to California if I wanted, and I hadn't done so yet&#8212;so why would I move for a new job in the same area?) My husband's job is here, we live in the middle of a vibrant city, both of our commutes can be accomplished on foot, and our son's school is literally around the corner from our house. I pick the Beaner up from school on the days he's dismissed at 11:45 and make him lunch. I can do a load of laundry in the middle of the day if I need to. I can sign for packages and be around if an installer or repairman needs access to the house without having to interrupt my normal work schedule.
</p>

<p>
[I didn't list &quot;not having to get dressed&quot; among the benefits of working at home because I always get dressed, and I usually wear the same clothes I'd wear if I were in the office. (I do like being able to change into yoga pants if I'm feeling irritable, however; I'm not sure *why* this helps, but it usually does.)]
</p>

<p>
For all the benefits of working at home&#8212;and while the list above isn't exhaustive, I hope it's convincing&#8212;there are some downsides. The obvious ones are that it's lonely; that I miss out on cross-cubicle communication
and random hallway encounters that always inform and sometimes inspire; that I have to work harder to be remembered and included. It's easy to become disconnected, even when you love the team you work with, the product you work on, and the company you work for.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps less obvious (at least to me, since it only occurred to me recently) is that working at home gives you a chance to see an alternative to feeling lonely and disconnected. You start looking around you and seeing a kid you could be playing with, a house you could be cleaning, books you could be reading, projects you could be finishing. Never mind that no one will pay you to do those things; when you're feeling lonely and disconnected, the instant and visible gratification of a hug, a clean house, or a completed book or project can seem worth more than even the largest paycheck and the best benefits. This might not be a problem on its face, but if you start pining for the clean house and the completed project, it only adds to the feelings of lonliness and disconnectedness, and there's a danger of spiralling downward and making stupid decisions.
</p>

<p>
One way I found to combat this downward spiral when I was at Adobe was to visit the office as often as possible... which, sadly, wasn't that often. Just because a trip isn't in the budget doesn't mean it can't happen, however; sometimes you can compromise and share the costs. For example, you could use airline or hotel miles to pay for either airfare or lodging, and have your company pick up the other item. (I did this once, when I was desperate for some facetime.) You could stay with a friend or family member. If you're within a couple hours' drive of your office, you could go in once a week or every other week. The idea is to remind people who  you are, have some productive facetime (in both formal meetings and informal hallway chats), and get reconnected to the team and its goals. In short, to remind yourself why you work, so the piles of laundry don't start looking more appealing than your job.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that helps, for me at least, is to work on a project or feature with another engineer, a QA partner, or just about anyone else, as long as they're a full partner and not just someone you report to periodically. When I work with someone else, I fulfill what my friend Kristin identified as one of her primary needs in a job (and, it turns out, one of my primary needs as well): namely, to &quot;feel like I'm part of a team/hive with a common goal.&quot; I definitely felt like I was part of a hive working toward a common goal back in the late 90s when we were working on Dreamweaver 1 and 2 (and I was in the office for 12+ hours a day), but I also felt that way when I was working on my feature for Dreamweaver CS3 with another engineer (who also happened to work remotely). I had someone to bounce ideas off of, to review my code, to help me get unstuck&#8212;and, most importantly, to connect me to the team and the release. 
</p>

<p>
For the last release, I worked on a lot of research and feature projects by myself in the early part of the cycle, and I didn't feel nearly as connected. I couldn't see how my contribution mattered, and I felt a bit isolated. Not good. I don't think I realized until recently that working on my own vs. working with a partner was a large part of my feelings of uselessness. (Luckily working by myself was not all I did for the CS4 release; there was also QRB, which I loved; the team lead gig with Hamburg; and the JavaScript Extractor with Kin and Don, among other projects.)
I think, in short, that it not only takes self-discipline to work from home, but also self-awareness: It's important to be able to identify when things aren't working, and to examine WHY. Hard to do when you're already feeling like there's no one off of whom to bounce ideas, but essential.
</p>

<p>
I guess what I'm saying with all of this is that I'm starting to consider whether the downsides of working at home outweigh the benefits, and whether I'm willing to change my arrangement. I think in the short term, just recognizing that I have to work harder to maintain a connection in the absence of frequent office visits and engineering partnerships will help. In the long term... well, we'll see.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Bethlehem Steel</h3>

<p> Last year when my women's hockey team drove up to Bethlehem to play the Lehigh Valley Wicked, I discovered on arrival that the rink at which we were to play was situated next to a derelict steel mill. The thing was gorgeous in its decay, with tall, rusty tubes and stacks contrasting beautifully with the blue sky, and blasted bricks and gaping windows framing empty innards. I made a mental note to bring the good camera with me next time we came to Bethlehem.</p>


<p>Al, the Beaner, and I actually spent a weekend in Bethlehem over the summer, but we didn't make it to the mill. My team played the Wicked again today, however, and this time I came equipped: I packed the Canon 10D, the little Canon 870IS (which I didn't end up using), a disposable black &amp; white camera, the Vivitar Ultra Wide &amp; Slim, the Polaroid One-Step, and the new (well, OLD) Spartus Full-Vue that I received from an eBay seller yesterday.</p>
<p>I ended up having only 5 minutes to shoot before the game (I was one of the last on the ice), and maybe 6 or 7 minutes after (because the light was fading fast), which wasn't nearly enough to satisfy my taste for decay. I could have wandered around for hours if only the chain link fence, the light, and the ambient temperatures had allowed (it was a bitter and windy 30 degrees). This is what I got with the 10D; the Polaroids are downstairs, waiting to be scanned; the Vivitar roll isn't finished yet; and I have no idea if any of the medium-format shots I took with the Spartus will come out. Basically, bringing the cameras just left me hungry for more, and resolved to arrive earlier next time we play the Wicked at home this season.</p>

<h3 class="title">Whew, Pooped</h3>

<p>
The Beaner's birthday isn't until next Sunday, but as that is Thanksgiving weekend, we had his birthday party today. It was a joint party with a classmate whose birthday is on Thanksgiving Day; we figured that since both kids wanted to have their parties at the same place, and they'd invite all the same classmates plus maybe one or two out-of-school friends, we might as well kill two birds with one stone.
</p>

<p>
We did two separate cakes so that each kid would get to blow out his and her own candles (and so there would be an artificial flavor/artificial color/preservative-free option for the Beaner), but otherwise there was no duplication.
</p>

<p>
I ended up making the Beaner's cake because he didn't want chocolate cake (the bakery we'd planned to use has awesome "safe" chocolate cakes, but I'm not sure about their yellow cakes), and because it just seemed like the easiest way to guarantee no artificial crap. He made it a bit harder by also requesting no frosting; he says it "tastes funny." I think it's probably just too sweet, but it's hard to know for sure.
</p>

<p>
At first I thought I'd just dust his cake with powdered sugar, but once I got the thing assembled (I made two boxes of Dr. Oertner's&#8212;or whatever the organic cake mix brand that Whole Foods carries is&#8212;vanilla in 9x13 pans and spread Trader Joe's low-sugar organic strawberry preserves between the layers), I didn't think the powdered sugar idea would work.
</p>

<p>
I consulted <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307236722?ie=UTF8&tag=avocado8&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307236722">Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook</a> for ideas, trying to come up with something that was whipped cream-like, but more stable. (The Beaner loves whipped cream.) I finally hit on a Mascarpone frosting recipe that involved a pound of Mascarpone cheese, 1.25 cups of heavy cream, and only 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar. I figured it would do.
</p>

<p>
Before I iced the cake last night, I had to put the Beaner to bed. I read him three stories and told him he needed to go to sleep quickly so I could get downstairs and finish his cake. "I want a car-shaped cake!" he said enthusiastically. I started and thought, "crap, why didn't I think to get a car-shaped cake mold?", and then, "how the heck would I shape what I've got into a car?" I finally said, "oh, Boo, I'm not sure I can do that."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he said, not uncheerfully. "Then can you make the cake in my favorite shape?" I bought time with an "ummm," praying he wouldn't say his favorite shape was a circle. "My favorite shape is....A RECTANGLE!" he shouted. I smiled and said, "that I can do."
</p>

<p>
Long story short, the Mascarpone frosting was perfect, the cake as a whole tasted great, the Beaner had no complaints, and I'd totally make the same cake again, perhaps with raspberry filling next time. Oh, and the party was a huge success. Woo!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Cranberry Egg Nog Oatmeal</h3>

<p>
I think I made it through NaBloPoMo last year almost entirely on the back of my recipe book. This year I've only mentioned the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2008/11/reviewpreview.html">apple butter experiment </a>so far, and I haven't posted any actual recipes. Having just finished a bowl of Cranberry Egg Nog Oatmeal, however, I feel compelled to share. (Al says that this is one of the things I should serve in my cafe or B&amp;B someday in the distant future when I actually have such an establishment.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cranberry Egg Nog Oatmeal</strong>
</p>

<p>
1 c. cold water<br />
1/4 c. multigrain hot cereal (I use Country Choice, available at Trader Joe's)<br />
1 packet Trader Joe's organic instant cranberry oatmeal<br />
1/4-1/3 c. whole fresh cranberries, to taste (I keep a bag in the freezer year-round)<br />
1/4 c. egg nog (I use Organic Valley brand)<br />
1/4 c. 1% or nonfat milk<br />
raw (turbinado) or brown sugar
</p>

<p>
Pour water into a small saucepan over medium heat and add the multigrain cereal and the cranberries. Bring mixture to a simmer. Add the packet of cranberry oatmeal and cook, stirring frequently, until water is absorbed and oats are plump, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for about a minute. Transfer oatmeal to bowl, pour egg nog and milk on top, and spinkle with turbinado or brown sugar.
</p>

<p>
Tastes like the holidays to me!
</p>

<h3 class="title">Tuesday Roundup</h3>

<p>
I'm bleaching my hair, blogging for NaBloPoMo, trying to get a few more work items crossed off my list, making the guest bed for the company that's arriving tomorrow, scrubbing the guest shower, and finishing up the laundry (well, I'm doing the first two things right now, and the rest in a minute), and I still hope to be in bed by 10:30pm, if not asleep by then. Not sure I'm going to make it.
</p>


<p>
I need to be asleep soon because tomorrow morning is the Bagel Run&#8212;literally. I need to pick up bagels for Thanksgiving Brunch, and I plan to run to the bagel place in Queen Village. Yes, I could take the bus to 3rd &amp; Market and still get a decent morning walk in, but I've been enjoying my brief sprints across streets, and I'm thinking that maybe I'd like to run a little more. So tomorrow I will attempt to run as much of the distance from my house to Philly Bagels as possible. We'll see how it goes.
</p>

<p>
I've been meaning to write a post about the parent-teacher conference that Al and I had at the Beaner's school on the 14th, but I decided that really it'd just be a massive brag-a-thon (if I wanted to do it justice) and probably TMI to boot. So I will sum it up this way: The Beaner is doing SO MUCH BETTER than last year. The <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2008/11/observation.html">observation</a> *was* indicative of how he's been getting along in the classroom (namely, great&#8212;his teachers both remarked on how well he's been controlling his body this year). He's doing particularly well with language exercises, and he's also doing the binomial and trinomial cubes (which are considered sensorial materials rather than math), color box #2, the teens board, punching work, and map work, among other things. His teacher said that since his language and writing skills are pretty strong already, they're going to focus on more math work going forward. We left really excited and encouraged. /* Here endeth the mini brag-a-thon. */
</p>

<p>
Al will get to experience the Montessori birthday ritual this year, as the Beaner's birthday is on Sunday and I will be in San Mateo next week for an office visit. Shawna, the Beaner, and I have been working on an eggless banana muffin recipe so the Beaner can share goodies he helped bake with everyone in the class, including the friend who's allergic to eggs. I will share here once I've got a recipe I'm happy with.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I officially sent my site link in to Eden at NaBloPoMo, which probably means I've jinxed myself and will forget to blog once the company walks in the door tomorrow. Maybe I should set an alarm...

<h3 class="title">The Buzz</h3>



<blockquote>
I'm done with elephants and clowns. I want to run away and join the office.
<div style="text-align: right">&#8212;Mike Doughty</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
Happened to catch that lyric when I was running to the bagel place this morning (that went pretty well, btw&#8212;I ran about half the time, walked the rest), and it made me smile. I love when a lyric strikes me as appropos, or possibly even a sign... like when I was dealing with some work angst and ambivalence the other day, and You Can't Get What You Want Til You Know What You Want came on iTunes. 
</p>

<p>
OT: I can't seem to get the smell of fresh bagels out of my nostrils, even after a shower and sitting at my desk for an hour. I may need to go downstairs and raid the stash before tomorrow's brunch.
</p>

<p>
Something else I may need to do: Turn off the e-mail push on my iPhone. For my personal accounts I pull e-mail manually, but for work mail I use push. Unfortunately, I get an e-mail every time the build fails, and I continue to get one in intervals of 1 minute to 15 minutes until the build is fixed. Even with the ringer turned off on my phone, it buzzes audibly, and I finally figured out that getting 75 build failure e-mails between midnight and 7am is not good for maintaining a deep sleep. (I keep the phone next to my bed because I often listen to audiobooks as I drift off to sleep, and because it's my morning alarm.)
</p>

<p>
For the record, though I have broken the build before, I have never broken it before going to bed, and there's nothing I can do to fix it during the night if someone else has broken it or the build machine has run out of space. In short, I do not need to know that the build is broken. I need to sleep. Goodbye, push e-mail.
</p>

<p>
<em><b>Update: </b>I Twittered the lyric at the top of this post, and <a href="http://drinkerthinker.com/blog/">Lizzy</a> replied with Easy cowboy, what's the rush now?, which made me smile even wider.</em>

<h3 class="title">Another Appropos Quote</h3>

<p>
I came across another intriguing quote just now, this time not in a song (the one on my iPhone at the moment is instrumental :-), but in a New York Magazine article online.
</p>

<blockquote>
From Cacioppo’s point of view, our large brains didn’t evolve in order to do multivariable calculus or compose sonatas. They evolved in order to process social information—and hence to work collaboratively.<br />
<a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/52450/">Alone Together</a>, <em>New York Magazine</em>, December 1, 2008
</blockquote>

<p>
I've only read the article up to that quote, but I'm bookmarking it to finish later.

<h3 class="title">QRB</h3>

<p>
I know this is my third blog post of the day (so much for forgetting to blog once the in-laws walked in the door!), but I'm so darn touched over this that I have to spew some more.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/3061160115/" title="awwwwwwww by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3295/3061160115_ba08e41d35.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="awwwwwwww" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I received this tiny little trophy by FedEx today. No note was in the box, but the three little letters in the middle of the inscription were all my heart needed: QRB.
</p>

<p>
QRB stands for Quality Review Board, a term we used on the Dreamweaver team at Macromedia and that's still in use today. (Adobe folks will be more familiar with BRC, which I think stands for Bug Review Council.) In any case, QRB is all about reviewing bugs that have been reproduced by someone in QA/QE (Quality Assurance/Quality Engineering) and determining whether they should be opened (and to whom) or deferred. Sometimes we know that a bug is a duplicate of another, or that it's already been fixed and will be in the next build, and we can get the bugs off the QRB list that way.
</p>

<p>
[See this somewhat related post on Coding Horror that I happened to read today for more on bug categorization and deferral: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001189.html">That's Not a Bug, It's a Feature Request</a>.]
</p>

<p>
QRB used to meet at least three times a week; there were four or five core members who participated in every meeting, and usually two guests (one engineer and one QE) per week. I was one of the core members, and I actually enjoyed QRB. I liked having the 30,000 view of the product, as it were; I had an idea of which features were wonky, which features were relatively stable, where the gaps in our feature (especially legacy feature) knowledge were.
</p>

<p>
I'd just been saying to Al recently that I missed participating in QRB... and then this little trophy arrived, as if to say that QRB missed me, too.

<h3 class="title">Happy Thanksgiving!</h3>

<p>There's chaos in the kitchen this morning as Al slices bagels, his brother grinds coffee beans, I mix Boursin and cream cheese in preparation for frittata-making, and the Beaner and his cousin races around the dining room-kitchen loop. Must be Thanksgiving!</p>

<p>I have no doubt that if we were eating in today it'd be much worse, but we're having Thanksgiving dinner out. (There will be 12 of us, and our dining room maxes our at 6.) To make up for the lack of home-cooking we're hosting brunch for 8, and taking our plates to the living room. </p>

<p>OK, back to the chaos... and the frittata. </p>

<h3 class="title">Greetings From the Please Touch Museum</h3>

<p>
Al and I are visiting the new Please Touch Museum for the first time today. The Beaner's been here several times already and loves it. I'm really enjoying it, too; where the old place was almost claustrophobic, the new space has large rooms and soaring ceilings. It reminds me of the Pittsburgh Children's Museum, which we loved when we visited last Christmas.

At the moment we're in a room with Play-Doh and spongy dippin dots-like molding foam, foam blocks, trucks, and shapes that demonstrate fractions. There's a CD of children's show theme songs playing, and Al and I are playing Name That Tune while the Beaner moves from station to station.

The only thing I don't like about this place is the parents. The one thing that would make it better? COFFEE.

<h3 class="title">The Christmas Tree is Up</h3>

<p>'Cause that's how we roll around here. When I was growing up we actually put the tree up on the day after Thanksgiving, so by that standard, we're a day late. </p>

<h3 class="title">Now Is Not The Time to Get Sick</h3>

<p>
It's the Beaner's 4th birthday today, and it's a bit of a letdown for him after last weekend's party plus visits from his cousin, both sets of grandparents, another set of cousins, and his great-aunt in the past week. For me I think it's kind of a letdown too, in the sense that my body has apparently given up after all the company and planning and baking and whatnot. I'm tired and sweaty and cold and desperately trying to keep my brain and body functioning long enough to pack for my trip to California tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
Did I mention that I ordered custom thank-you notes for the Beaner to send out to everyone who gave him a gift at the party last Sunday? In any case, I did, and not surprisingly, they have not arrived yet. This means there'll be a delay in thanking everyone until I get back from California and can help the Beaner write cards.
</p>

<p>
Now that I think of it, that's around the time I should be sending out Christmas cards, so I should probably get on designing those. The good news on that front is that my dad helped me get a good photo of the Beaner (actually three or four good photos) to go on the card. I have no trouble catching a moment when it happens, but I need an assistant when it comes to getting my kid to sit still *and* smile in front of the Christmas tree. Thanks to dad and his elephant impersonations, the session didn't degenerate (entirely) into me shouting "SIT STILL! STOP GLARING AT ME!" while trying not to shake the camera.
</p>

<p>
All right, that's about all I have time for tonight. There's still packing left to do, and a frittata to make, and sleep to get. Ahhh, sleep, how I look forward to thee. I have a big week ahead of me.
</p>
