<h3 class="title">The Director Dream</h3>

<p>
Last night I dreamed that I was directing a movie. The dream started <em>en medias res</em> (do all dreams start that way? probably, but in this one, I felt like I'd been dropped into the scene); I was standing on a patch of ground outside a house, and there was a film crew behind me. On the large covered porch of the house were several actors.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure how I knew it, but I knew that the crew didn't have much faith in me. They didn't seem to think I was qualified to be a director, or that I knew what I was doing at all. I wasn't sure that their distrust and lack of faith was misplaced, as I wasn't sure what I was doing there or if I could manage the situation, either.
</p>

<p>
I walked over to the porch and addressed the actors (can't remember what I said), then called for the cameras to roll. I watched the scene unfold, and thought to myself, "these are either the worst actors ever, or the script is the worst ever&#8212;or both." The scene was terrible: Long, meaningless, ill-delivered. I watched in horror, wondering when it would end, forgetting that I had the power to yell "cut!"
</p>

<p>
I thought I heard a voice in the distance say "cut", so I turned toward it, and, not seeing anything, yelled "cut!" myself. It turned out I wasn't imagining things; it was one of the technicians in a trailer who'd said "cut". He came out and told me that we were about to lose the light. I said "OK," and that we should go again right away.
</p>

<p>
Just as we began shooting again, we did indeed lose the light&#8212;it became pitch black incredibly fast. The dream sort of became more confused at that point; I remember trying to feel my way to the porch, and I ended up on the outside of a small room with glass walls (like a conference room in the center of an office building), watching the actors from outside. The room was well-lit, but where I was standing remained pitch black, and they couldn't see or hear me.
</p>

<p>&lt;/end_dream&gt;</p>
