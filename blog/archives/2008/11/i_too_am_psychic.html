<h3 class="title">I, Too, Am Psychic</h3>

<p>
I had a <a href="http://www.fussy.org/2008/10/i-am-psychic.html">Mrs. Kennedy moment</a> this morning. I woke up, rolled over, and thought, "I wonder if I'm ever going to meet <a href="http://juliloquy.typepad.com/">juliloquy</a> in person." I thought about the missed connections at the playground&#8212;when we said we'd be there after tee ball and then ended up skipping tee ball&#8212;and how I'd run into HPR once at Trader Joe's, but Julie and I never seemed to run into one another, despite visiting the same places frequently.
</p>
<p>
So I lay there thinking this, and then I got up and started my day. Did some work. Had some good ideas. Did some more work. Then left the house to meet my husband for lunch in the basement of the Comcast building.
</p>

<p>
I got there first, so I started checking out the food offerings... when suddenly who should walk up and say, "hi!" but Julie. I felt like I'd imagined her into being with my early-morning wishful thinking. Aside from that, it was a totally normal encounter. Julie mentioned that she felt like she already knew me, and I felt the same way. I got another chance to interact with the super-sweet Roo (who'd been at TJs with her dad), and to meet the Shmoo (we shook hands), and we talked about potential playdates and the fact that the Shmoo and the Beaner are a very similar size and shape (they're also 3 weeks apart in age).
</p>

<p>
I'm already looking forward to the next time we meet up&#8212;and next time I won't be leaving it to wishful thinking or chance encounters. I'm going to e-mail Julie and make a date.

<p>It <b>was</b> fantastic to meet you at last! Thanks for conjuring me up - hee. It could easily have been another near-miss if the kids and I had stared at the Comcast screen a few minutes longer or if we had walked outside rather than going underground to the SEPTA station. But I'm glad it wasn't. And I look forward to having a bit more time to chat with you, whenever we can set it up.</p>

<p>I forgot that you hadn't met Shmoo, only Roo. Also funny is that I've seen ratphooey's #1 on the playground, but haven't met her yet. You're next on my list, S!</p>
