<h3 class="title">BarCamp Philly</h3>

<p>
I got up early to come to BarCamp Philly this morning, knowing there was a 99% chance I wouldn't present anything. So far, I'm on track with that prediction. There are several topics I *could* speak about&#8212;CSS, JavaScript, development process, learning to play ice hockey, how to color your own hair&#8212;but none I'm *prepared* to speak about, at least formally.
</p>
<p>
Informally, sure. I keep thinking about my friend Kin, who assured me that he was incapable of speaking in front of a crowd and then fielded questions with ease from the front row of my presentation at MAX last year. He was fine as long as he wasn't on a stage with a microphone and a podium and slides because he was <em>just talking</em> with other geeks. That's how I feel today; I'll be fine as long as I'm <em>just talking</em> and not presenting.
</p>

<p>
Maybe next year I'll get up the gumption to present on something. Maybe I'll even prepare some slides ahead of time. That's how it usually happens: I see a bunch of presentations, think "I can do that [or better than that]," and confidence blooms. (It usually goes out the window in the 48 hours leading up to the presentation, but at least by then I have a speaking slot, some slides, and an idea of what I'm going to say.)
</p>

<p>
It's hard to say whether I'm more reserved than usual; I have this sense that I used to be like this all the time, and then I felt more comfortable with myself and my knowledge, and now I'm back to feeling shy and insecure...though maybe shy and insecure has always been the norm. No, I take that back. <em>Arrogant</em> and insecure has always been the norm, according to my mom.
