<h3 class="title">Tuesday Roundup</h3>

<p>
I'm bleaching my hair, blogging for NaBloPoMo, trying to get a few more work items crossed off my list, making the guest bed for the company that's arriving tomorrow, scrubbing the guest shower, and finishing up the laundry (well, I'm doing the first two things right now, and the rest in a minute), and I still hope to be in bed by 10:30pm, if not asleep by then. Not sure I'm going to make it.
</p>

<p>
I need to be asleep soon because tomorrow morning is the Bagel Run&#8212;literally. I need to pick up bagels for Thanksgiving Brunch, and I plan to run to the bagel place in Queen Village. Yes, I could take the bus to 3rd &amp; Market and still get a decent morning walk in, but I've been enjoying my brief sprints across streets, and I'm thinking that maybe I'd like to run a little more. So tomorrow I will attempt to run as much of the distance from my house to Philly Bagels as possible. We'll see how it goes.
</p>

<p>
I've been meaning to write a post about the parent-teacher conference that Al and I had at the Beaner's school on the 14th, but I decided that really it'd just be a massive brag-a-thon (if I wanted to do it justice) and probably TMI to boot. So I will sum it up this way: The Beaner is doing SO MUCH BETTER than last year. The <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2008/11/observation.html">observation</a> *was* indicative of how he's been getting along in the classroom (namely, great&#8212;his teachers both remarked on how well he's been controlling his body this year). He's doing particularly well with language exercises, and he's also doing the binomial and trinomial cubes (which are considered sensorial materials rather than math), color box #2, the teens board, punching work, and map work, among other things. His teacher said that since his language and writing skills are pretty strong already, they're going to focus on more math work going forward. We left really excited and encouraged. /* Here endeth the mini brag-a-thon. */
</p>

<p>
Al will get to experience the Montessori birthday ritual this year, as the Beaner's birthday is on Sunday and I will be in San Mateo next week for an office visit. Shawna, the Beaner, and I have been working on an eggless banana muffin recipe so the Beaner can share goodies he helped bake with everyone in the class, including the friend who's allergic to eggs. I will share here once I've got a recipe I'm happy with.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I officially sent my site link in to Eden at NaBloPoMo, which probably means I've jinxed myself and will forget to blog once the company walks in the door tomorrow. Maybe I should set an alarm...
