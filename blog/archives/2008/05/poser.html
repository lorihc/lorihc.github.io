<h3 class="title">Poser</h3>

<p>
I have a bunch of Beaner anecdotes to relate, but I'm blogging from my iPhone, so this will be brief. We seem to have moved from the stage where the Beaner was immune to my "hey Beaner" prompts to get him to look at the camera, to one where he's so hyper-aware that he's being photographed that he'll freeze a pose to make sure I get the shot. 
</p>
<p>
Tonight at Rita's, while eating a chocolate cone, he gave me the wink and thumbs-up he uses to mean "this is totally rocking the house." I got out the Polaroid and said, "give me the thumbs-up again." He did, but with none of the charm and spontenaity of the first time, and without attending to his cone.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," I said. "Eat your ice cream," at which point he touched his tongue to his cone and froze in what I'm sure he thought was "boy eating ice cream" pose... and Al about died laughing.
