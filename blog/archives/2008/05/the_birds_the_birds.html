<h3 class="title">The Birds! The Birds!</h3>

<p>The starlings were mocking me. I understand that now. I spent the morning on the back deck, transplanting the orange pepper seedlings and repotting two yellow pepper plants in more container-friendly soil (I carefully took the plants out of their containers, mixed some seed starter and coir-based potting mix into the topsoil/manure &amp; hummus blend that was already in there, and then replaced the plants), and the starlings shouted at me from the former sparrows' nest they'd taken over the whole time I was out there.</p>
<p>Little did I know that they were just waiting for me to leave so they could undo all my work. Sometime this afternoon, they attacked both orange peppers and the smaller of the two yellow peppers&#8212;AND the Baxter's Early Bush Cherry tomato. The peppers are GONE. The tomato might be salvagable; I'm not sure yet. The watermelon that was attacked a few days ago seems to be clinging valiantly to life, so I suppose the tomato could do the same.</p>

<p>I took the time tonight to make a chicken wire cloche for the Sprite grape tomato just in case, and I'm glad I found a water bottle that would work for the Elfin grape this morning. I'm going to have to think of a solution for the already-fragile Mexican Gherkin soon too, or it will likely be the starlings' next target.</p>

<p>Netting tacked across the deck beams over the plants until they get more established should do it.  To discourage deer, I boiled a bunch of Habanero chilis in vegetable oil and have been spraying it around my garden.  It's an organic solution, teaches them a pretty strict lesson, but doesn't really hurt or poison them, and keeps me from having to spray poison in my yard.   I've had some nibbles, but they aren't making large meals after the first taste.  Pepper is supposed to work with rodents and birds too.</p>
