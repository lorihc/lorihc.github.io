<h3 class="title">Gas Prices Are Up, and I Can't Say I'm Sad</h3>

<p>
I might be the only person in the U.S. who's happy that gas prices are nearing $4 a gallon. Yes, I wince when I have to fill up my own gas tank, and I have sympathy for those who drive for a living, but I still can't help smiling whenever the news reports that people are walking, using public transit, and bicycling more, or that sales of small cars are up among those who must drive.
</p>
<p>
This country is probably too vast for most of us to stop driving completely, and I like a good road trip as much as the next person, but in my humble opinion, we as Americans drive WAY too much&#8212;especially in places where alternatives are readily available. There's no reason for gridlock in most cities, for example, where public transportation, walking, and biking are all options.
</p>

<p>
Many would argue that the alternatives take too long, that driving is faster and more convenient, but I'd say that as more people get on the road, that's less and less the case. Sitting in traffic is a painful, polluting waste of time... and when you get where you're going, parking is often either expensive or difficult to find (and sometimes both). Walking or taking the subway may take longer, but often the time is more productive. A colleague gave me an interesting stat: the most productive members of my team all have one thing in common: namely, a lengthy commute by train. Whether they work, sleep, or read a book on the train, they arrive at work focused and ready to go, and they get more done.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, walking or biking to work can double as your daily exercise. No need to carve out workout time; you've burned calories and commuted at the same time. And don't underestimate the value of having extra time to yourself to let your mind wander. Whether you want to think through a problem, make a call, or sketch out an idea, it's a heck of a lot safer to do any of these things while walking or riding the subway than while driving. (I wouldn't recommend using a cellphone or whipping out your Moleskine while riding a bike, however. :-)
</p>

<p>
Aside from finding commute alternatives, I'm also happy that gas prices are rising because perhaps now we'll finally have the political will to raise the CAFE standards. When we started looking for a new(er) car last year, I was dismayed to find that setting a minimum MPG of 28 cut our options significantly. I shouldn't have had to say, "OK, 24 then," but I did. Sad. Higher fossil fuel costs also make alternative energies more competitive on cost, which means they have a better chance of taking hold&#8212;and that there'll be an incentive to develop more alternatives&#8212;which could ultimately lower the cost of these technologies for everyone.
</p>

I'd note that I'm not a fan of using food crops for fuel, but that topic would require a separate post. :-)

<p>Ha, I've been feeling kinda happy about that, too. :-) I wish "An Inconvenient Truth" had converted all those people, but, whatever works. </p>
