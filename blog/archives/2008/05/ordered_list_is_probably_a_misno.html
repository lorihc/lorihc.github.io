<h3 class="title">"Ordered List" Is Probably a Misnomer in This Case</h3>


<ol>
<li>The Beaner has a fever. We're planning on going to Dutch Wonderland on Saturday, so I hope it's not the beginning of strep or something.</li>
<li>I need to have a discussion with someone not in my immediate family about parenting boundaries. As in, dude, I'M the parent here, STEP OFF.</li>
<li>We might be having company this weekend, and after cleaning the living room, the guest bath, and the dining room, vacuuming the downstairs, and doing three loads of laundry (including guest sheets and towels), the house is still a complete disaster. I feel like I haven't even made a dent.</li>
<li>Either my fitness level is improving, or reading is the magic bullet that makes exercise palatable. 38 minutes on the elliptical trainer, most of it spent at the top end of the heart rate spectrum, feels like nothing these days. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmerican-Creation-Triumphs-Tragedies-Founding%2Fdp%2F030726369X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1203619680%26sr%3D1-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">American Creation</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFriday-Night-Lights-Town-Dream%2Fdp%2F0306809907%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1211505780%26sr%3D1-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Friday Night Lights</a>&#8212;both do the trick equally well.</li>
<li>I hope to finish the roll of film on which resides the last few <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157600238740199/">My Every Day</a> photos this weekend, and then I can finally call that set complete. I may start another such project in January 2009, but for now I'm taking a break.</li>
<li>My secret supplier of Polaroid 600 film has raised its prices again, and is currently out of stock to boot. Damn, right when I felt the need to hoard some more.</li>
