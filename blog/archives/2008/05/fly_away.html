<h3 class="title">Fly Away</h3>

<p>
Despite my reluctance to discuss the details of the current parenting nightmare, I've apparently been clear enough here that the Beaner's been on a Bad Behavior tear lately that it prompted my sister to call and offer her sympathies today. And with that opening I proceeded to write four paragraphs on the Beaner's behavior... only to decide against publishing them. It's too complicated, with too many threads leading into dangerous places, to talk about in detail publicly. Instead I offer this brief glipse into our day today:</p>

<p>I saw you on the street yesterday!  Crossing Arch 1t about 11:15 AM.  Al was pushing the Beaner on his push trike (the Beaner was occasionally peddling), and you were a few paces behind them.  In fact, at first I didn't notice you.  And then a ray of sunshine lit up your glorious purple hair.</p>

<p>If you want to talk/rant/bitch & moan about parenting challenges, my ear and I are here.</p>

<p>Oh, I've been there. Totally been there. Although I think we may be seeing some light at the end of the behavior tunnel. These kids. Always keeping us on our toes!</p>
