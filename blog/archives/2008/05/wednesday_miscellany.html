My cheerful, encouraging note to the Beaner this morning (I left for the gym before he woke up) did not have its intended effect. He was sent to the hall again today, and &quot;doesn't remember&quot; why.

I have so little on my plate right now (especially compared with this time last year) that I can't believe I complained to my manager about two of the things on it in our 1:1 today. I think the problem is there's nothing I can really throw myself into, nothing that is so interesting and absorbing that I lose track of time working on it. Instead, I have a few tasks that take a few hours a week each, adding up to a roughly 40-hour slate... but not a fully-engaged employee. I don't feel like I'm gaining expertise in any one area, I'm just chipping away at issues that come up infrequently. So even though nothing I have to do is very taxing, it's also not very edifying. I should come up with a plan to address this. Take charge of my professional development and all that.

I got permission to travel to San Francisco for an office visit from July 16-20, and I've registered for the Cocktail Parties Only option at BlogHer '08. Hope to see you there.

<p>Don't feel defeated, though. I know it's hard. We've been trying to find ways to encourage Devin to avoid the office, but he ended up there again yesterday for dumping food on the floor. Some of the things we read on his daily charts they send home with us just freak me out. But I know he's going to work his way through this and so is the Beaner. I keep saying to myself, "He's just testing us. He's just testing us."</p>
