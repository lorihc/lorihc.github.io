<h3 class="title">A Peanut Butter Birthday</h3>

<p>
Today was Grandparents &amp; Special Friends Day at the Beaner's school, so both Al's parents and my mom drove up to attend (my dad had to work). It's also my mom's 61st birthday today, so after school the Beaner, Grandma, and I walked/bused to More Than Just Ice Cream for a birthday lunch.

<p>
Grandma ordered a special sundae with vanilla peanut butter ice cream and Reese's peanut butter sauce, and a chicken satay. The Beaner threw a thumb in her direction and said, &quot;I'll have what Grandma's having.&quot; We clarified that he wanted a vanilla peanut butter cone and an order of macaroni and cheese. :-)

</p>

<p>
I don't think the waiter heard/believed/understood her when she said she wanted her order all at once (I think, honestly, that she wanted the ice cream first and the satay second, and the Beaner made his preference for the cone first perfectly clear, IMHO), but it was probably good that he didn't. I don't think the Beaner would have eaten any macroni and cheese if he had. I applaud the Beaner, btw, for being brave and trying the mac &amp; cheese even though it had salsa on top. He ended up liking it quite a bit.

<p>
Mom, for her part, was thrilled with her birthday treat. I think dinner tonight will just be icing on the birthday cake; for her, it was all about that peanut butter ice cream.
