<h3 class="title">Interruptions</h3>

<p>
A sure sign that we're actually paying more attention to the Beaner now: I'm getting irritated when someone interrupts my lunchtime conversations with the Beaner, and Al's getting irritated when I try to talk to him while he's having playtime with the Beaner. Ah yes, I remember this!
</p>
<p>
Not so very long ago, it was like this all the time. I was pulling my hair out trying to figure out how to time the nanny's arrival so that she was there when I needed to leave for a meeting, but she wasn't there when I really just wanted to spend some quality time eating lunch with my child. Apparently I got over this conundrum by *not* trying to have quality time with my kid after school, by bustling around the kitchen and getting his lunch while the nanny talked to me or to him. Now I'm back to pulling my hair out... but at least I'll be bald for a good cause.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I am down in the basement doing laundry, checking our bank balance, and blogging when what I most want to do is TALK TO MY HUSBAND because said husband is upstairs playing with our kid. They are having quality father-son time, and as I know only too well, it is impossible to focus on one's kid while another adult is trying to talk to you (or to the kid). Perhaps if I'd been able to successfully IM my husband (curse you, MSN Messenger, the only IM client allowed by my husband's office) I wouldn't be so desperate to talk to him at the end of the day, and we wouldn't have this dilemma. But there'd still be the problem of the nanny. Harrumph. Looks like we need some more adjustments.
