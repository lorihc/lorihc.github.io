<h3 class="title">It's Amazing What a Bottle of Wine, a Polaroid Camera, and Some Good Conversation Can Do</h3>

<p>
I started the day sleep-deprived (on account of staying up late to see the west-coast Sharks beat the Dallas Stars in overtime&#8212;woot!) and a bit depressed, and there was a moment where I almost burst into tears for no particular reason except that I was sad and not liking the feeling. BUT! things improved as the day went on, mostly due to three important factors: (1) Al recognized the malaise and most generously offered to stop the car along Lancaster Avenue so I could get out and take photos (I'd mentioned that I'd like to do  that sometime, but I didn't think we had the time or he'd have the inclination to do it today); (2) after a shaky end to the school picnic, I opened a bottle of really yummy wine and ordered pizza for me and the Beaner; and (3) <a href="http://www.nopasanada.org">HeatherB</a> came over to share the wine and hang out for a few hours.
</p>

<p>
I'm too tired to post the Polaroids I took along Lancaster Ave and at the school picnic, and despite having no less than 6 cameras within easy reach, I completely forgot to take a photo of Heather when she was here, so for the moment you'll just have to trust me that all of this really happened. I blame the sparkling conversation (and the yummy wine) for the lapse in photodocumentation. Heather was lovely company, and she handled the constant interruptions from the Beaner with aplomb. It was really the most pleasant afternoon I could imagine, especially after the cloudy start to the day (both literally and figuratively).

<p>I had two cameras with me. TWO. How do I have ZERO photos of you? And we're bloggers. We should know better. I had a lovely afternoon with you and I'm glad your day got better. </p>
