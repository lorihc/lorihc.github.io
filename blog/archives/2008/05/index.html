<h3 class="title">The Garden</h3>

<p>
I'll start May's NaBloPoMo effort with an update on my garden, if for no other reason than to remember it later. (Wait, that's pretty much 90% of the reason I write *anything* here.) After <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_planting.html">planting the tomato and pepper seeds back in March</a>, I discovered, via an incredibly helpful <a href="http://www.yougrowgirl.com/thedirt/2008/04/03/your-questions-answered-containers-for-tomatoes/">post at You Grow Girl</a>, the difference betweeen determinate and indeterminate tomatoes. It turns out I've been growing the wrong kinds of tomatoes for years. Determinates = smaller, usually bushier plants (thought not necessarily smaller tomatoes&#8212;the Sweet 100s that I grew a couple years ago and that volunteered in the compost pot last year were indeterminates), whereas indeterminates = monstrosities that require a ton of space and water. Once I determined that my beefsteak-variety seedlings fit into the latter category, I set about scouring the seed racks for determinate varieties... and came up empty.
</p>

<p>
However, all was not lost: Gayla came through with a generous offer of seeds, and I found a website which offered several determinate varieties of <a href="http://www.tomatogrowers.com/small.htm">grape and cherry tomatoes</a> (the seeds Gayla sent were for <a href="http://www.seedsavers.org/prodinfo.asp?number=428">Czech's Bush</a> and Patio Orange, which yield medium-sized fruit). Gayla also offered some seeds for <a href="http://www.seedsavers.org/prodinfo.asp?number=1192">these cool Barbie-sized watermelons</a> (actually gherkin cucumbers :-) and some &quot;chocolate cherry&quot; sunflowers. Thus, a second round of seed-starting was in order:

</p>

<p>
The Gold Nugget cherry tomato seeds didn't germinate, so I started another cup of them this weekend; hopefully these ones will sprout. The sunflower seeds I added to the mostly-cooked compost from last season, and I also donated a few seeds to the Beaner's school when I was there taking photos for their Arbor Day activities last Thursday.

</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I planted just about everything I started back in March in pots on the back deck... and then discovered why all the bags of soil I'd been using said NOT FOR USE IN CONTAINERS on them. I'd never had any *trouble* using this soil in containers, but I discovered when I FINALLY bought <a href="http://www.superfantastico.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=7&amp;products_id=1">Gayla's book</a> (and this is something you should do, too, if you have the least interest in growing anything yourself&#8212;I put it off for so long because I AM NOT A GARDENER, or so I thought&#8212;because it's a beautifully-designed, easy to understand, virtually unputdownable and downright fabulous guide that's like no other &quot;gardening&quot; book you've ever seen) what I should have been using instead and why. What it boils down to is that containers need a special mix&#8212;usually some combination of peat or coir, vermiculite or sand, and perlite (the little white balls in the photo above)&#8212;that retains water well and gives the roots room to breathe. Regular soil compacts too much and suffocates the roots. Well, fart! Given that I've grown things in containers using my weird topsoil-homemade compost-manure/hummus mix before, I figure I'll get *something*, and if I make it through this gardening season and end up wanting to do it all and more next year, I'll know better and will possibly even get better results.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2456167719/" title="pepper seedlings in the garden by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3276/2456167719_a3eb6b1b3e_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="pepper seedlings in the garden" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2456996376/" title="baby sugar bush watermelon by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2139/2456996376_9901198e94_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="baby sugar bush watermelon" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2456996590/" title="sad little tomato by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/2456996590_95aec7f9d8_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="sad little tomato" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I suppose I could have figured out that container plants like peat, vermiculite, and perlite from experience (and not just from that  all-caps warning on the bag&#8212;that's not for me, that's for stupid people!). I ended up using seed starter mix, which contains those magic three ingredients, instead of the &quot;layer of fine soil&quot;, which I did not have, when I sowed the beet and pea seeds outdoors. Those two veggies are doing swimmingly. In fact, that the Beaner accidentally raked up the soil in the container right after we planted the peas probably worked in their favor, as it distributed the space-and-drainage-promoting seed starter throughout the soil. These pots also drained a heck of a lot faster than the soil/manure pots when we got a heavy downpour on Monday.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2456996750/" title="beet seedlings by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2094/2456996750_20cc284c74_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="beet seedlings" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2456167093/" title="sugar snap peas by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3212/2456167093_dd59530929_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="sugar snap peas" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2457199483/" title="drowned plants by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2006/2457199483_e6b8d46576.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="drowned plants" /></a>
</p>

<p>
The other upside is that&#8212;as you'll recall from the second paragraph of this post&#8212;I haven't yet planted the second round of seedlings, so there's still a chance to get it right this year. To that end I hunted up some organic potting soil (the only &quot;container mix&quot; I could find contained chemical fertilizers, which I DO NOT WANT) and some more seed starter mix, and I've been creating a custom blend of those two items, the topsoil, and the manure/hummus. This morning I spotted a container/potting mix at Whole Foods that contains coir instead of peat, so I might get a bag or two of that tomorrow if I remember to bring my granny cart or the wagon with me to the gym. I think it'll be another week or two before the indoor seedlings are ready to be planted outdoors, so I've got time if I forget.

<h3 class="title">Management Style</h3>

<p>
Today's post will be a short one, mainly to report that after two atrocious days at school (where sending the Beaner home was considered but rejected because it would be seen as a reward, because Mommy works at home) and a slightly longer stretch of disrespect, defiance, distraction, and disruptive behavior at home, the Beaner had a better day today. As Mrs. Bennett once said in reference to Mr. Collins' marriage, &quot;I only hope it will last.&quot; Unlike Mrs. Bennett, however, I am being sincere.
</p>


<p>
It occurred to me this morning, after it became clear that what we think of as our morning routine was blown to bits yet again, that it's time for a new <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2007/08/the_schedule.html">schedule</a>. It also occurred to me that raising a child is the ultimate management training seminar, and that if I ever want to try managing (at work) again, I should start practicing on my kid. Raising an independent child is not unlike <a href="http://anitaborg.org/news/archive/ask-jo7/">being a good manager</a>, after all; in both cases, you want to provide the tools to get the job done, give the person being managed the autonomy to do it, remove any obstacles to success, etc. To this end, I think we'll be drawing up a new morning schedule with input from the Beaner, and asking for suggestions from him on how we can all be held accountable for its success.

<h3 class="title">It's Amazing What a Bottle of Wine, a Polaroid Camera, and Some Good Conversation Can Do</h3>

<p>
I started the day sleep-deprived (on account of staying up late to see the west-coast Sharks beat the Dallas Stars in overtime&#8212;woot!) and a bit depressed, and there was a moment where I almost burst into tears for no particular reason except that I was sad and not liking the feeling. BUT! things improved as the day went on, mostly due to three important factors: (1) Al recognized the malaise and most generously offered to stop the car along Lancaster Avenue so I could get out and take photos (I'd mentioned that I'd like to do  that sometime, but I didn't think we had the time or he'd have the inclination to do it today); (2) after a shaky end to the school picnic, I opened a bottle of really yummy wine and ordered pizza for me and the Beaner; and (3) <a href="http://www.nopasanada.org">HeatherB</a> came over to share the wine and hang out for a few hours.
</p>


<p>
I'm too tired to post the Polaroids I took along Lancaster Ave and at the school picnic, and despite having no less than 6 cameras within easy reach, I completely forgot to take a photo of Heather when she was here, so for the moment you'll just have to trust me that all of this really happened. I blame the sparkling conversation (and the yummy wine) for the lapse in photodocumentation. Heather was lovely company, and she handled the constant interruptions from the Beaner with aplomb. It was really the most pleasant afternoon I could imagine, especially after the cloudy start to the day (both literally and figuratively).
</p>

<h3 class="title">Fly Away</h3>

<p>
Despite my reluctance to discuss the details of the current parenting nightmare, I've apparently been clear enough here that the Beaner's been on a Bad Behavior tear lately that it prompted my sister to call and offer her sympathies today. And with that opening I proceeded to write four paragraphs on the Beaner's behavior... only to decide against publishing them. It's too complicated, with too many threads leading into dangerous places, to talk about in detail publicly. Instead I offer this brief glipse into our day today:</p>

<h3 class="title">The Sunflowers Never Had a Chance</h3>

<p>
I'm now kicking myself for not photographing the sunflower seedlings that sprouted in the compost bin (where I'd planted them about 10 days ago) this weekend. I went out to survey my kingdom this morning and found every seedling save one (that apparently just came up last night, in a divot) looked like it had beheaded by a weed whacker. Some stems where broken cleanly in two places, and it looked like something had been digging a bit in the corner.
</p>

<p>
While it's <em>possible</em> that the Beaner could have done the damage when I had my back turned yesterday, I don't think that's the case. I remember giving everything a final once-over before I finished yesterday's gardening stint, and while I didn't notice the sunflower seedlings in particular, I did check all the other plants. The yellow pepper that suffered the same fate&#8212;it looked like someone snipped its top off with scissors&#8212;was certainly alive, well, and upright when I went inside.
</p>

<p>
I'm now trying to figure out what could have done the damage. My deck is fairly high up, with six-foot fences separating it from my neighbors' decks. I've never seen any animals out there aside from flies, bees, birds, and one giant cockroach that Al and I each glimpsed once and then never saw again. Could a bird have made the clean cuts? Is the giant cockroach now lobster-sized? Did a squirrel find the bounty? (And if so, why just raze the sunflowers and one pepper plant instead of eating the peas or the beet greens?) It's a mystery.
</p>

<p>
I'm now wishing I hadn't donated the remaining sunflower seeds to the Beaner's school, so I could have another shot at them. I still have hope for the one growing in the divot, though. I also had an extra yellow pepper seedling still in a yogurt cup, so I just pulled out the snipped one and replaced it with the leftover. If that doesn't thrive, I still need places for all the orange pepper seedlings being hardened off as we speak.
</p>

<p>
I got a little overeager and planted a few of the second batch of tomato seedlings yesterday, before I'd fully hardened them off. The good news is that they went into much better soil mixes than the first set of seedlings, so I'm hoping that they thrive. I'm realizing that I'm going to need a few more buckets for next week's round of planting, as I've already exhausted my current supply (already about two or three times the capacity I had last year!). I'm also realizing that&#8212;*gasp*&#8212;I seem to have become a gardener. It might be time to take the gardening posts out of "around the house" and give them their own category.

<h3 class="title">A New Schedule, A New Tack</h3>

<p>
I mentioned a few days ago that we were trying to rearrange our daily schedule, and that I intended to get input from the Beaner about it. In the end there was really only one option that worked, so he was not consulted. He was informed, however, and though it wouldn't be his choice&#8212;his choice would be for Mommy to do everything... except when he wants Daddy to do it&#8212;he's adapted pretty well. Al's now in charge of the morning routine so I can leave between 7:30 and 7:40 for the gym, and I'm now in charge of the nighttime routine. We've basically swapped. I still put the Beaner to bed as I always did (again, unless the Beaner begs for Daddy), Al still drops him off at school, and I still pick him up at 11:45am and feed him lunch. (This is the main reason we swapped; with me having to pick him up at midday, being in charge of a morning routine that was dragging on past 8:15am meant that either my workout or my working hours had to go. I didn't want to give up the former, and I can't give up the latter.)
</p>

<p>
After much discussion, we're also trying a new strategy for dealing with the Beaner: We're making a concerted effort to pay more attention to him. Haven't you been doing that already, you may ask? Well, yes and no. We've been spending time with him, certainly. But we realized that we weren't giving him our undivided attention nearly as much as we thought we were, and we realized we'd fallen into the habit of dragging him around and/or deciding where we could go, what we could (or couldn't) do, and when we could do it according to our schedule and desires. (See above for evidence of that. :-) As I've said many times before, here and elsewhere, I am a selfish person. I like my time and my space. I don't play well with others easily. (I can and I have worked/played effectively with others, but being by myself is my first choice.) And this was the primary reason I did not want to become a parent.
</p>
<p>
I'm glad I *did* become a parent, and in my humble opinion I've done a little better at the whole parenthood thing than I thought I would, but the selfishness/need for solitude thing will always be my achilles heel. It'll always be the rut I fall back into after resolutions to Do Better and Interact More. I'm sure I'll fall back into it again eventually after the current push to Pay More Attention. But for right now I'm doing everything I can to make the Beaner feel like he doesn't have to tap dance, become class clown, or be a stubborn, petulant, defiant, and disrespectful little shit in order to get me to focus on him.
</p>
<p>
I've been asking him for a while now whether he'd rather have me yelling at him and giving him time outs or spending quality time with him, and the answer is obvious to both of us. Our definitions of &quot;quality time&quot; were a bit different, however; if it were really a choice between yelling and, say, sitting down to lunch together and discussing whatever's on his mind face to face, I think he would have stopped misbehaving instantaneously. The choice was really between yelling and us doing different things in the same room, however, and that wasn't really what he wanted. I think he was willing to risk the yelling to possibly gain a more interactive experience with mom.
</p>
<p>
So for the past two days I (and Al, too&#8212;I should give credit where credit is due and mention that this insight, and the strategy that emerged from it, were his) have been putting the theory to the test and giving the Beaner my full attention when we're together. It hasn't solved all the behavior problems&#8212;we're still working on a LOT of things&#8212;but things did go from All Bad to Mostly Good. The side benefit is that when we do have to reprimand or correct, we have more credibility. Instead of being at DEFCON 4 all the time and knowing that only the nuclear option remains, we've got the full range of options at our disposal. We're able to be calm and reasonable more often when an incident occurs. This is not to say that I don't get angry, but I am finding that spending QUALITY time with him&#8212;REAL quality time&#8212;is not such a chore, and that it can, in fact, bring joy. This means it's a longer leap to exasperation and despair.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, for the first time since our Disney vacation, the Beaner said to me (as we were eating lunch together at the dining room table), &quot;my heart feels super happy.&quot; I think that's a good sign.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Interruptions</h3>

<p>
A sure sign that we're actually paying more attention to the Beaner now: I'm getting irritated when someone interrupts my lunchtime conversations with the Beaner, and Al's getting irritated when I try to talk to him while he's having playtime with the Beaner. Ah yes, I remember this!
</p>

<p>
Not so very long ago, it was like this all the time. I was pulling my hair out trying to figure out how to time the nanny's arrival so that she was there when I needed to leave for a meeting, but she wasn't there when I really just wanted to spend some quality time eating lunch with my child. Apparently I got over this conundrum by *not* trying to have quality time with my kid after school, by bustling around the kitchen and getting his lunch while the nanny talked to me or to him. Now I'm back to pulling my hair out... but at least I'll be bald for a good cause.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I am down in the basement doing laundry, checking our bank balance, and blogging when what I most want to do is TALK TO MY HUSBAND because said husband is upstairs playing with our kid. They are having quality father-son time, and as I know only too well, it is impossible to focus on one's kid while another adult is trying to talk to you (or to the kid). Perhaps if I'd been able to successfully IM my husband (curse you, MSN Messenger, the only IM client allowed by my husband's office) I wouldn't be so desperate to talk to him at the end of the day, and we wouldn't have this dilemma. But there'd still be the problem of the nanny. Harrumph. Looks like we need some more adjustments.

<h3 class="title">Give and Take</h3>

<p>
We had a rough lunchtime today. Well, lunchtime itself wasn't rough&#8212;we played at the playground, sat down to eat together, shared some yogurt, read a book twice. It was when I got up to go back to work that things got bad.
</p>

<p>
All I have to say is: I'm not sure if what I have to give is ever going to be enough.

<h3 class="title">A Peanut Butter Birthday</h3>

<p>
Today was Grandparents &amp; Special Friends Day at the Beaner's school, so both Al's parents and my mom drove up to attend (my dad had to work). It's also my mom's 61st birthday today, so after school the Beaner, Grandma, and I walked/bused to More Than Just Ice Cream for a birthday lunch.

Grandma ordered a special sundae with vanilla peanut butter ice cream and Reese's peanut butter sauce, and a chicken satay. The Beaner threw a thumb in her direction and said, &quot;I'll have what Grandma's having.&quot; We clarified that he wanted a vanilla peanut butter cone and an order of macaroni and cheese. :-)

</p>

<p>
I don't think the waiter heard/believed/understood her when she said she wanted her order all at once (I think, honestly, that she wanted the ice cream first and the satay second, and the Beaner made his preference for the cone first perfectly clear, IMHO), but it was probably good that he didn't. I don't think the Beaner would have eaten any macroni and cheese if he had. I applaud the Beaner, btw, for being brave and trying the mac &amp; cheese even though it had salsa on top. He ended up liking it quite a bit.
</p>

<p>
Mom, for her part, was thrilled with her birthday treat. I think dinner tonight will just be icing on the birthday cake; for her, it was all about that peanut butter ice cream.

<h3 class="title">In NYC</h3>

<p>
I'm writing this longhand (because blogging from my iPhone when the post is longer than a Twitter entry is tedious) and will post it when I get home tomorrow night. We're in NYC visiting Al's brother's family for the weekend; Cousin H's school fair was this afternoon, and we drove up to join in the fun. The roasted corn was tasty, the fishing in the Little Mermaid blow-up pool was fruitful, the cupcake decorating was a sparkly, sugary hit, and we came home with two toys that I would have said were a little young for the Beaner, but that he and Cousin H have been playing with ever since.
</p>

</p>

<p>
After some bike-riding in the park by the boys (supervised by the dads), we had a yummy dinner at Graciela's on Columbus, marred a bit by the Beaner's harrassment of his cousin and his refusal to listen to me when I told him to stop. "How many times do I have to tell you to STOP IT?" I demanded. "Three," he said petulantly, and was instantly dragged outside for a time out. (I asked Al to do it, because I was too angry to do it myself. This was the final escalation point of a long "keep your hands to yourself!/no bathroom language at the table" battle.)
</p>

<p>
Al brought him back in about 10 minutes later, but he refused to apologize and immediately started in with his cousin again, so Al did an about-face and took him outside again. When I realized that Al hadn't finished his dinner and I had, however, I went out to relieve him. After a couple minutes more of silence, I asked the Beaner what he needed to do differently. "Be responsible," he said, which is nice and all, but it's a stock answer that wasn't exactly appropriate to the situation. "Being responsible is good," I said, "but you need to CONTROL YOUR BODY AND YOUR MOUTH, and above all, you need to do what?"
</p>

<p>
"Listen," he said, correctly this time. "To whom do you need to listen?" I asked. "What?" he responded. "Who are you going to listen to?" I rephrased. "H____!" he giggled. I spun him around by the shoulder and up against the wall again. "WRONG. We're going to be out here until you get it right." I then surreptitiously took two photos of him, one with my film camera, and one with the iPhone. He was so petulant and put out that he didn't even notice, which was perfect for my purposes. I wanted to capture his defiant, bad-boy persona.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

</p>

<p>
After a few minutes he turned his attention back to me, and I said, "who are you going to listen to?" "Mommy," he said. "Right," I said. "And Daddy." "And Uncle Carl and Aunt Tris," he added. "Yep," I said. "And while we're at it, Ms. Erwin and Ms. Beck as well." I took his hand, and we went back inside, and the rest of the evening went a bit better.
</p>

<p>
Well, until the cousins tried to sleep in the same room, that is. After going in a couple times to tell them to get in their own beds and GO TO SLEEP, and a couple living room visits from Cousin H to report that the Beaner would not be quiet or stop saying he was thirsty, I finally separated them. Al is now sitting with the Beaner in our room, waiting for him to fall asleep.

<h3 class="title">A Day in Which We All Needed a Nap</h3>

<p>
Short summary of today: golf lessons for Cousin H and the Beaner (the latter's first, and he loved it), a shopping walk for me (woo, three pairs of workout pants from Gap Body!) that ended in a migraine (OW!), a lunch of leftovers from Graciela's (yum!), a nap for Al (so he'd be awake enough to drive home) and for me (so the icepicks in my left eyebrow would relent a bit), a tantrum by the Beaner when we told him it was time to leave, a 45-minute nap by the Beaner begun in the Lincoln Tunnel, barely civil behavior after he woke up (from him to us, not the other way around; favorite quote: "I wish you'd gotten more milk in that cup," said in the most ungrateful tone I've yet heard from him, after I told him that the vanilla milk I'd bought him at Starbucks was gone), a bonanza at the Gymboree at Cherry Hill Mall (three pairs of PJs, a jacket, and some shorts for $60!), buckets, chicken wire, and lettuce seeds from Home Depot, dinner at Wegmans, laundry, a short struggle at bathtime followed by endless avowals that I was loved soooo much (I suspect in an effort to postpone sleep), and then peace.
</p>

<p>
I'm too tired from transcribing yesterday's post and scanning the Polaroids to go with it to elaborate further, but I'm not sure it's necessary anyway. The paragraph above kinda speaks for itself. It was a productive, fun, painful, tiring, frustrating, but ultimately fine day.

<h3 class="title">Gas Prices Are Up, and I Can't Say I'm Sad</h3>

<p>
I might be the only person in the U.S. who's happy that gas prices are nearing $4 a gallon. Yes, I wince when I have to fill up my own gas tank, and I have sympathy for those who drive for a living, but I still can't help smiling whenever the news reports that people are walking, using public transit, and bicycling more, or that sales of small cars are up among those who must drive.
</p>

<p>
This country is probably too vast for most of us to stop driving completely, and I like a good road trip as much as the next person, but in my humble opinion, we as Americans drive WAY too much&#8212;especially in places where alternatives are readily available. There's no reason for gridlock in most cities, for example, where public transportation, walking, and biking are all options.
</p>

<p>
Many would argue that the alternatives take too long, that driving is faster and more convenient, but I'd say that as more people get on the road, that's less and less the case. Sitting in traffic is a painful, polluting waste of time... and when you get where you're going, parking is often either expensive or difficult to find (and sometimes both). Walking or taking the subway may take longer, but often the time is more productive. A colleague gave me an interesting stat: the most productive members of my team all have one thing in common: namely, a lengthy commute by train. Whether they work, sleep, or read a book on the train, they arrive at work focused and ready to go, and they get more done.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, walking or biking to work can double as your daily exercise. No need to carve out workout time; you've burned calories and commuted at the same time. And don't underestimate the value of having extra time to yourself to let your mind wander. Whether you want to think through a problem, make a call, or sketch out an idea, it's a heck of a lot safer to do any of these things while walking or riding the subway than while driving. (I wouldn't recommend using a cellphone or whipping out your Moleskine while riding a bike, however. :-)
</p>

<p>
Aside from finding commute alternatives, I'm also happy that gas prices are rising because perhaps now we'll finally have the political will to raise the CAFE standards. When we started looking for a new(er) car last year, I was dismayed to find that setting a minimum MPG of 28 cut our options significantly. I shouldn't have had to say, "OK, 24 then," but I did. Sad. Higher fossil fuel costs also make alternative energies more competitive on cost, which means they have a better chance of taking hold&#8212;and that there'll be an incentive to develop more alternatives&#8212;which could ultimately lower the cost of these technologies for everyone.
</p>

<p style="font-size:smaller">
I'd note that I'm not a fan of using food crops for fuel, but that topic would require a separate post. :-)

<h3 class="title">The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit</h3>

<p>
One summer Sunday when I was about 8 years old, our friends Anne and Peggy and their two kids, Lee and John, came over to our house. I'm not sure what the adults were doing&#8212;sitting in the house or the yard talking or cooking, probably&#8212;but the four of us kids were playing outside. We had a GMC pickup truck with a cap on the back at the time, and my father had tricked it out with  carpet remnants and curtains. (My sister and I had slept back there during the long drive from Boston to Disney World the summer before, if I have my timeline right.) Because the back was separate from the front, my father had also installed an intercom system in the truck. We could push a button on a little controller and ring my parents up front to tell them that we had to pee or whatever. (We didn't have to tell them we were hungry, because my mom packed a great big grocery bag of snacks for us.)
</p>


<p>
Anyway, on this particular Sunday the truck was parked in the driveway, and we were playing around it. I must've asked if we could play *in* the truck at some point, because I know my mom told us not to play with the intercom. I have no idea how long after this admonishment it was that we started playing with the intercom, but play with it we did... until we broke it. And boy, were my parents angry. Not ONLY had we played with the intercom when they'd specifically told us NOT to, but we'd BROKEN IT.
</p>
<p>
I know that the day we broke the intercom was a Sunday because on Sundays at 7pm we always watched The Wonderful World of Disney before going to bed, and on this night, as punishment, we were sent to bed early&#8212;at 6:30pm instead of 7:30 or 8 (or whenever Disney was over). I'm not sure whether my parents realized that by sending us to bed early they were also forbidding us to watch Disney (probably), but they almost certainly did not realize when they doled out the punishment that missing Disney meant missing Part 2 of The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit.
</p>
<p>
When <em>I</em> realized that I'd be missing Part 2 of The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit, I practically rent my pajamas. I was a certifiable horse nut by this time, and I'd been looking forward to watching the second half of Gray Flannel Suit for an ENTIRE WEEK. I couldn't believe my parents could be so cruel. And lord knows, if I'd realized that this&#8212;THIS!&#8212;would be the punishment, I'd have listened more carefully to my mother and never even <em>breathed</em> on that damn intercom. My self-absorbed 8 year-old mind never saw it coming, however.
</p>
<p>
How my parents could have remained calm and resolute when I was sitting at the top of the stairs crying and shrieking, &quot;it's not FAIR!&quot; and &quot;I KNOW YOU'RE DOWN THERE WATCHING IT WITHOUT ME!&quot;, I'll never know. What I can guess now is that they were <em>trying</em> to watch 60 Minutes (not so much to avoid further cruelty to their daughter, but rather because they didn't care a whit for The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit), but with my sobs and pleadings drowning out Morley Safer, they were probably doing more teeth-gritting than TV-watching. It took incredible stamina, and I'm sure it also took a temporary&#8212;if only for the hour that I wailed&#8212;toll on their marriage. It's a difficult thing to present a United Front in the face of a despondent 8 year-old.
</p>
<p>
To this day, I've never seen the end of The Hose in the Gray Flannel Suit (I remember trying to find it on video when I was in college, and being unsuccessful), and I've obviously never forgotten the shock and horror of the unforeseen consequences of my actions. I behaved badly, not only disobeying my parents, but doing actual damage, too.
</p>
<p>
I thought of The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit  when I told the Beaner that there would be no bedtime story tonight, after he called me an inappropriate name. At first he treated the news as he usually does: mostly by ignoring it, and partly by flouting it. I helped him into his jammies, and then he dove under his loft bed to retrieve a book. &quot;Let's go brush your teeth,&quot; I said. &quot;I want to read a book,&quot; he replied. &quot;No,&quot; I said, not unkindly. We marched to the bathroom for a final pee, and he looked grim while I brushed his teeth. When we returned to his bedroom, he again asked to read a story. &quot;No,&quot; I said again, removing the book he'd tossed on the bed. He started to whine.
</p>
<p>
&quot;I'm sure you're sorry NOW that you called me a ________,&quot; I said, cutting off the beginning of the tantrum without really raising my voice, &quot;because this is what it got you. This is not me doing this to you. This is you doing this to yourself. Your bad behavior loses you TV privileges. It loses you classroom privileges. And tonight it lost you story privileges. YOU control your destiny. YOU can decide to earn these things you want by behaving well, by not using potty language, by controlling your body and respecting your parents, teachers, and classmates. I know you can do it. It's up to YOU.&quot; I turned out the light, turned on the HEPA filter, and closed the door, and then I came back to the head of the bed and reached for his hand. I wanted him to know that I wasn't walking out on him, that I still loved him and would stand there and hold his hand until he fell asleep, but he WOULD be falling asleep. There would be no story.
</p>
<p>
He thrashed about to show his displeasure, and I told him it was pointless to tantrum now. He was expected to go to sleep. He tossed about for a while longer, but more in his usual mode of pre-sleep restlessness and less in protest. &quot;I'm sorry I called you a ________,&quot; he finally said. &quot;Thank you,&quot; I replied. &quot;I appreciate your apology.&quot; He apologized two more times in the next five minutes, and then I said, &quot;Your apology is accepted. I don't want you saying that word any more now.&quot; A couple minutes later he said simply, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; I thanked him again and told him that now it was time for sleeping. His body twitched with sleep for the first time about a minute later, and the second twitch&#8212;the one that tells me I can withdraw my hand without waking him&#8212;came a minute after that.
</p>
<p>
I know the first two apologies at least were designed to get him the story, and I harbor no illusions that his behavior will improve markedly after tonight. I also have no worries that missing out on a story tonight will scar him for life. I do hope, however, that it leaves a mark. A little horseshoe-shaped brand on his psyche to remind him of consequences wouldn't be a bad thing at all.
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Yin and The Yang of It</h3>

<p>
The Beaner has a habit of focusing on the negative. We can have had a fabulous day together, and he'll focus on the toy I just told him he couldn't buy, or the fact that he has to take a bath when he doesn't waaaaaaaaaaant to. Usually I try to snap him out of the downward spiral by building a ladder out of all the good things that happened that day. (It's sort of a variation on the "<a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2007/01/two_beaner_note.html">mommy loves you, and daddy loves you, and grandma loves you..."</a> litany I used to recite to him at bedtime when he was littler.)
</p>

<p>
On Sunday when we were driving back from New York, and the Beaner got stuck in the misery of the fact that we had to leave his cousin's house, Al introduced the concept of yin and yang. "What's that?" asked the Beaner. "It's a belief that the world is in balance between the light and the dark, the good and the bad, and that even the worst evil has a kernel of good in it, and the most good has a kernel of something bad," I said. "Daddy's trying to tell you that you're only sad to be leaving now because you had such a good time this weekend. The leaving is the small kernel of bad in a large pool of good."
</p>

<p>
Today was a day like that: mostly good, with only a small kernel of bad. For the first day in a long time, the Beaner wasn't given a time out at school, sent out into the hall, or made to sit with Miss Nicole in the lobby. He was kind and polite and a joy to be around after school. He wished me a good day at work after lunch, and said goodbye cheerfully to Aura at the end of the day. Aura said he had a little trouble this afternoon, but when I asked the Beaner about it he didn't say, "I don't remember," as he usually does. Instead he explained that he'd had trouble saying goodbye gracefully after playing with J and R in the park.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2493894314/" title="garden hoe and dirt boy by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2093/2493894314_7309a870b5.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="garden hoe and dirt boy" /></a>
</p>

<p>
The evening was a little chaotic because I invited him to garden with me, and then Al and the Beaner painted the car they'd made out of a cardboard box. We didn't end up eating dinner until almost 8pm, and we'd also promised him he could watch some TV because he'd had a good day at school, so bedtime didn't happen until 9pm. The disruption in the schedule affected Al and me more than it did the Beaner, however, thanks to the better day overall. At bedtime I said to him, "you had a really good day today. Let's try to build on this for tomorrow." He repeated the phrase "build on this" to himself before asking me to sit in the chair until he fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to think that I just planted a seed of positivity in his brain, one that will help him build his own little ladder of happiness when he feels the pull of the downward spiral. You can do it, my love. Cling to the yang!

<h3 class="title">Wednesday Miscellany</h3>

<p>
My cheerful, encouraging note to the Beaner this morning (I left for the gym before he woke up) did not have its intended effect. He was sent to the hall again today, and &quot;doesn't remember&quot; why.
</p>


<p class="pictureP">

</p>

<p>
I have so little on my plate right now (especially compared with this time last year) that I can't believe I complained to my manager about two of the things on it in our 1:1 today. I think the problem is there's nothing I can really throw myself into, nothing that is so interesting and absorbing that I lose track of time working on it. Instead, I have a few tasks that take a few hours a week each, adding up to a roughly 40-hour slate... but not a fully-engaged employee. I don't feel like I'm gaining expertise in any one area, I'm just chipping away at issues that come up infrequently. So even though nothing I have to do is very taxing, it's also not very edifying. I should come up with a plan to address this. Take charge of my professional development and all that.
</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
I got permission to travel to San Francisco for an office visit from July 16-20, and I've registered for the Cocktail Parties Only option at BlogHer '08. Hope to see you there.

<h3 class="title">My Very Understanding Husband Is At the Flyers Game Right Now</h3>

<p>
Oy, I'm sick. I thought Al was being kind of a baby by staying home from work and sleeping for the past three days (mainly because he seemed fairly functional when awake), but now that he's passed the illness on to me, I suddenly understand the impetus for sleep. I slept until 10am this morning, needed another half hour to get out of bed, had a 45-minute nap this afternoon, and at just shy at 9pm am desperate to get back in bed (just have to blog and fix a bug first).
</p>

<p>
The snot and the sleepiness are the main reason I turned down Al's offer to join him at game 4 of the Pens-Flyers series. He'd gotten hold of two extra tickets late in the day, and I encouraged him to go and enjoy himself; I knew he'd have no trouble finding someone in the office to take the other ticket. The other reason I declined is that Austen actually had a GOOD DAY at school today (and afterwards), and I'd told him that we'd go out for ice cream tonight. I didn't want to renig on that promise and abandon him at the same time.
</p>

<p>
I was more than happy to promote Al's going, however, not least because I only realized *after* getting permission to come out to San Francisco during BlogHer that I'd be gone the very weekend we'd planned to celebrate his birthday with a return trip to Annapolis&#8212;and that I'd be gone for his birthday itself. This realization kind of took all the joy out of the SF trip planning, and I'd been thinking all night and morning how to make it up to him. I would have encouraged him to go to the game anyway because HELLO, playoff hockey!, but it's a start. I'm still trying to figure out how to make it up to him ON his birthday, as well.

<h3 class="title">And THAT'S How You Play Hardball</h3>

<p>
I was listening to MSNBC yesterday, as I often do while working, when this crazy shouting match erupted on Hardball. I ran into the other room to watch, and then ran back to my computer afterwards to Twitter what I'd seen. Of course, Twitter was down right then, so I pinged my friend Kristin and gave a breathless account of the exchange between Chris Matthews and Kevin James over IM.
</p>

<p>
Just now, Kristin sent me <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/05/15/kevin-james-appeaser/">this link to a thinkprogress.org writeup</a> of the incident. (There's also a video clip.) It's painful to watch, but fascinating. Moral of the story: <strong>Know your facts, not just your soundbites.</strong>

<h3 class="title">The Birds! The Birds!</h3>

<p>The starlings were mocking me. I understand that now. I spent the morning on the back deck, transplanting the orange pepper seedlings and repotting two yellow pepper plants in more container-friendly soil (I carefully took the plants out of their containers, mixed some seed starter and coir-based potting mix into the topsoil/manure &amp; hummus blend that was already in there, and then replaced the plants), and the starlings shouted at me from the former sparrows' nest they'd taken over the whole time I was out there.</p>

<p>Little did I know that they were just waiting for me to leave so they could undo all my work. Sometime this afternoon, they attacked both orange peppers and the smaller of the two yellow peppers&#8212;AND the Baxter's Early Bush Cherry tomato. The peppers are GONE. The tomato might be salvagable; I'm not sure yet. The watermelon that was attacked a few days ago seems to be clinging valiantly to life, so I suppose the tomato could do the same.</p>

<p>I took the time tonight to make a chicken wire cloche for the Sprite grape tomato just in case, and I'm glad I found a water bottle that would work for the Elfin grape this morning. I'm going to have to think of a solution for the already-fragile Mexican Gherkin soon too, or it will likely be the starlings' next target.</p>

<strong><em>stretching (or not) at tee ball</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
There was some drama at tee ball as the Beaner went into full &quot;this is bullshit, I refuse to validate this nonsense by participating in it&quot; mode (otherwise known as Lori Mode). &lt;sigh&gt; There's nothing more discouraging than watching your child exhibit your character flaws.

<strong><em>calibration</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
I've known for a long time that the viewfinder in the One Step didn't match the final result. This shot was an attempt to figure out how far off, and in what direction, it was when using the 4ft-infinity setting.
</p>

<p class="picStory">
In the viewfinder, I was lined up such that the left 2 in the 22 was on the edge of the frame.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2505385521/" title="dresses by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3154/2505385521_0cedf9c924_m.jpg" alt="dresses" width="198" height="240" class="noborder" /></a><br />
<strong><em>dresses</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
On the walk home from tee ball, I spotted these dresses in the window of a shop I'd never noticed before. My first thought: oooh, pretty. My second thought: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mylakent/2367509907/in/set-72157594192310293/">Myla</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lala/2284160848/">Ali</a>. Camera!

<strong><em>ZÉ sighting</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
About a block later, I saw a No Outlet sign and was reminded of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2351485462/">this photo</a>. As I got closer, I looked to see if there was a ZÉ sticker on this one, and behold! There was.
</p>

<strong><em>license to hunt terrorists</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
Despite a forecast of rain, we decided to drive out the Ocean City, New Jersey, where we parked behind this car. "Does that say <em>license to hunt terrorists</em>?" I asked Al. It did. I'm not sure what to say about that.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2501800689/" title="synchronized cracker eating by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2210/2501800689_af3b07ffe2.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="synchronized cracker eating" /></a><br />
<strong><em>synchronized cracker eating</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
Al had expressed interest on the drive out to Ocean City in finding a crab shack and getting a clam strip sandwich or something similar. We lamented that we'd never been able to find a decent seafood place <em>at the beach</em>. As we were walking in a light rain from the car to the boardwalk, Al was grumbling about the distance, and I was welcoming the blame for choosing such a terrible parking spot (1 whole block farther away from the boardwalk than I'd intended!), we noticed a little building with a sign out front that said Clams - Oysters across the street. Suddenly, my parking choice looked like GENIUS.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2506444000/" title="lobster curtains (and al) by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3268/2506444000_bdc218573d.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="lobster curtains (and al)" /></a><br />
<strong><em>lobster curtains (and al)</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
After finishing his chowder and while awaiting his flounder sandwich (I ordered the clam strip platter, thanks to Al's planting of the idea earlier, and the Beaner shared our food and feasted on crackers), Al and I admired the crustacean curtains. The rainy day and the cozy surroundings brought back vague memories of the Cape (or perhaps Martha's Vineyard?) from my childhood.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2501812887/" title="cracker tricks by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2154/2501812887_95e6539acc.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="cracker tricks" /></a><br />
<strong><em>cracker tricks</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
The Beaner had a ball eating (and performing tricks with) the oyster crackers that accompanied Al's chowder. He had demanded fried macaroni and cheese (something that to my knowledge only Cheeburger Cheeburger has on their menu), but he seemed content when we told the waitress he'd just share what we were having. He got plenty to eat, so did we, and there was less waste than usual (something that's begun to bug me lately).
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2506217460/" title="shrivers by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2207/2506217460_5056bec393_m.jpg" width="199" height="240" alt="shrivers" class="noborder" /></a><br />
<strong><em>shrivers</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
Using the info I learned from the earlier calibration shot, I tried to squeeze the entire Shriver's sign into the frame. I lined the left edge up with the R, I think. Still cut the Y off of TAFFY.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2506218000/" title="italian by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2122/2506218000_df1011d5d6_m.jpg" width="199" height="240" alt="italian" class="noborder" /></a><br />
<strong><em>italian</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
I forgot to apply the right shift to this photo; I was sucked in by the framing in the viewfinder. Consequently, the extra bit of window that's showing on the left is bugging me. I really liked the neon, though, and the plural Dinners next to the singular Breakfast and Lunch.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2506503836/" title="taking a ride at the arcade by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3074/2506503836_e483aafa06.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="taking a ride at the arcade" /></a><br />
<strong><em>taking a ride at the arcade</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
I actually like cool, rainy weather at the beach; I like the idea of bundling up and walking the near-empty boardwalk, or staying inside reading or coloring (if you have a place there, that is). Unfortunately, I wasn't quite bundled enough on this day, and the wind kept pouring down the back of my neck. We stopped in this arcade so the Beaner could play a few games and ride a couple rides, and so we could get out of the wind for a bit.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2505387499/" title="fries - funnelcakes - lemonade by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3198/2505387499_7c57f48353_m.jpg" width="199" height="240" alt="fries - funnelcakes - lemonade" class="noborder" /></a><br />
<strong><em>fries - funnelcakes - lemonade</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
Unfortunately, I had to go right back out into the wind when I discovered that our meter was about to run out. We'd only put in an hour and fifteen minutes worth of quarters... but that was before we'd spotted Spadafora's. Being able to eat yummy seafood out of the wind and rain extended our visit a bit. I made the most of my walk back to the car by stopping to take photos of interesting signs.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2506445762/" title="closed for the season by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2325/2506445762_dde6925d52.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="closed for the season" /></a><br />
<strong><em>closed for the season</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
Or perhaps more accurately, Not Yet Open for the Season. The theater next to Shrivers was open, however. "Oh, that's the movie were talking about seeing&#8212;Baby Mama," said Al as we passed the Now Showing posters. "I'm glad we saw Iron Man instead," I replied. Although I'm a fan of Tina Fey, I have doubts about Baby Mama. And I think Al was secretly thrilled that I expressed interest in seeing a superhero movie on Friday night. I'm not a fan of the genre in general, but I *am* a fan of good movies, and I enjoyed Iron Man. (I also really liked Batman Begins, which defined the New Superhero genre to which Iron Man belongs, in my opinion.)
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2505388025/" title="jetty by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3081/2505388025_3b51be97bf_m.jpg" width="198" height="240" alt="jetty" class="noborder" /></a><br />
<strong><em>jetty</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
I really need to think of the viewfinder-to-photo discrepancy as the "shift right" instead of the "left shift". Here I ended up moving the camera further left instead of further right, and almost cutting off the jetty in the process. I wanted it to be on the right edge of the frame, but not *that* far right. Apologies to the fellow contemplating the ocean waves whom I scared with the sound of the One Step ejecting its prize.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2506219414/" title="wonderland by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2239/2506219414_886366e8b1_m.jpg" width="199" height="240" alt="wonderland" class="noborder" /></a><br />
<strong><em>wonderland</em></strong>
</p>

<p class="picStory">
At the end of the boardwalk is Wonderland, a strange little amusement area. The Beaner wanted to investigate, but opted not to go in and ride the carousel, much to my dismay (it would have been an opportunity to get out of the wind). He and Al played a round of miniature golf instead, and then we headed home (with a stop at Home Depot first, where I picked up some more chicken wire for the garden&#8212;photos of my further efforts to protect the garden from the attacking birds to come).

<h3 class="title">Garden Photos</h3>

<p>
I mentioned that I'd done some more chicken-wiring after the bird attacks of Saturday, and that I would be posting photos shortly. I've started a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157605085027594/">garden 2008</a> set on Flickr for this purpose. The photos are in chronological order starting with the first seed planting back in March, so the latest photos of bird damage and chicken wire-covered planters are at the end.

<h3 class="title">Tuesday Miscellany</h3>

<p>
The miscellany's coming a day early this week.
</p>

<p>
I don't mind cool weather at all&#8212;my favorite climate can be found in San Francisco (which isn't saying much, since there are so many microclimates) where it's 50-70 degrees most days with some foggy days and some clear, dry days&#8212;but hello, May in Philadelphia? Yeah, hi. Aren't you supposed to be warmer? Less rainy? Isn't it April's job to handle the showers, and yours to produce the flowers? Just checking, because if recent history and the current forecast are any guide we're still a ways away from temps staying above 55&deg; at night, and that doesn't seem right. I'm impatient, thought, so, I planted my peppers long ago.
</p>

<p class="sep"></p>

<p>
The Beaner has had TWO DAYS IN A ROW where he didn't go out to the hall at school. I hope this is a sign of improved behavior, and not just that Ms. Erwin has grown weary of sending him out in the hall all the time. There was ice cream after dinner last night to celebrate; tonight we'll go watch Al play hockey. Note to self: Remember to bring the thundersticks.
</p>

<p class="sep"></p>

<p>
Al and I are going to see Liam Finn again tomorrow night at XPN's World Cafe Live. Woo! On a related note, I stopped to buy some generic Zyrtec at CVS last night (I declined a bag in favor of just holding the box in my hand), and as the Beaner and I were running down 21st Street on the way home, the bottle of pills was sliding back and forth inside the box to the rhythym of my footfalls. Clunk-shhhcchhh-clunk-shhhcchhh-clunk-shhhcchhh-clunk-shhhcchhh. Al goes, "hey!" and starts singing, "So it seems... <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theliamfinn">so it seems tonight</a>..." and I continue, "you've got that wild look in your eyes..."
</p>

<p>
If you're in Vienna, Virginia or thereabouts, Liam's playing with Laura Viers at Jammin' Java tonight; they'll be at the Bowery Ballroom on Thursday for those of you in New York; Bostonites can see them at the Middle East Downstairs on Friday; and then it's on to El Mocombo in Toronto on Saturday. All showtimes are 8pm. Check him out if you get a chance.

<h3 class="title">Parent-Friendly Rock</h3>

<p>
As I mentioned yesterday, Al and I had tickets to see Liam Finn tonight at XPN's World Cafe Live. Showtime on the ticket was 7:30, and even though bands at most venues don't go on until at least 30 minutes after the advertised showtime, and Liam's MySpace page indicated he'd be going on at 8, we decided to be punctual.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at about 7:25 after a quick sushi dinner at Aija and approached the bar. Something about it reminded me of the Carlos Club (friends from Redwood Shores will know what I'm talking about :-), so without even thinking, I said, "I'll have a Sidecar, up." The bartender had a look of panic for a split second and then nodded. I thought, "she doesn't know what a Sidecar is, but she's decided that someone else behind the bar will know, so it's not worth asking." After taking Al's order for a club soda she flagged down one of the other bartenders and said, "hey, want to make something?" She forgot the "up" part when she relayed my drink order, however, so he came over to inquire. In the end I got what I wanted, minus the sugar rim (which isn't that big a deal).
</p>

<p>
Anyway, as my drink was being set before me, the lights dimmed, and onto the stage walked Liam and EJ. Al and I looked at each other in surprise, and Al said something like, "alright, World Cafe! Way to run a tight ship!" The opening notes sounded terrible from the bar, however, so we went down to the floor to listen. MUCH better.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2512818538/" title="first song by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2394/2512818538_1ddd94a4f8.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="first song" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I didn't bring my camera with me because the venue clearly stated NO CAMERAS on their website, and I didn't want to be turned away at the door. There was a woman with a Canon SLR down front, though, and several people in the audience with point-and-shoots. As for me, I wasn't planning to abstain from photography entirely; I figured I'd just use my iPhone to get whatever I could.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2511882085/" title="EJ requests Remember When by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3290/2511882085_ca5dbd9c78.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="EJ requests Remember When" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2511880147/" title="Liam Finn @ world cafe live by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2156/2511880147_f714046fd0.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Liam Finn @ world cafe live" /></a><br />

</p>

<p>
He played all my favorites, I sang along and danced, and then suddenly he announced that this would be their last song. A few people booed, and he said, "oh, maybe we should leave now?" I responded with a bellowed "MOOOORE!" and was joined by several other shouts of "more, more!" Liam said we'd have to appeal to a higher-up at the club, and since no one knew were to find such a person on short notice, they kept to the schedule.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2511981751/" title="Liam, last song by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2012/2511981751_16d8198e06.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Liam, last song" /></a>
</p>

<p>
When the lights came up, I checked my iPhone: 8:10pm. We decided that rather than sticking around to watch headliner Laura Viers, we'd declare this the most parent-friendly show ever and head home to tuck our kid into bed. (Well, after I went to the stage to thank Liam for an awesome show. I got a genuine smile and a "cheers!" in reply.)

<h3 class="title">"Ordered List" Is Probably a Misnomer in This Case</h3>



<ol>
<li>The Beaner has a fever. We're planning on going to Dutch Wonderland on Saturday, so I hope it's not the beginning of strep or something.</li>

<li>We might be having company this weekend, and after cleaning the living room, the guest bath, and the dining room, vacuuming the downstairs, and doing three loads of laundry (including guest sheets and towels), the house is still a complete disaster. I feel like I haven't even made a dent.</li>
<li>Either my fitness level is improving, or reading is the magic bullet that makes exercise palatable. 38 minutes on the elliptical trainer, most of it spent at the top end of the heart rate spectrum, feels like nothing these days. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAmerican-Creation-Triumphs-Tragedies-Founding%2Fdp%2F030726369X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1203619680%26sr%3D1-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">American Creation</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFriday-Night-Lights-Town-Dream%2Fdp%2F0306809907%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1211505780%26sr%3D1-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Friday Night Lights</a>&#8212;both do the trick equally well.</li>

<h3 class="title">Poser</h3>

<p>
I have a bunch of Beaner anecdotes to relate, but I'm blogging from my iPhone, so this will be brief. We seem to have moved from the stage where the Beaner was immune to my "hey Beaner" prompts to get him to look at the camera, to one where he's so hyper-aware that he's being photographed that he'll freeze a pose to make sure I get the shot. 
</p>

<p>
Tonight at Rita's, while eating a chocolate cone, he gave me the wink and thumbs-up he uses to mean "this is totally rocking the house." I got out the Polaroid and said, "give me the thumbs-up again." He did, but with none of the charm and spontenaity of the first time, and without attending to his cone.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," I said. "Eat your ice cream," at which point he touched his tongue to his cone and froze in what I'm sure he thought was "boy eating ice cream" pose... and Al about died laughing.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Dreamweaver Next</h3>

<p>
Yep, I fell off the NaBloPoMo wagon this weekend. I considered trying to keep up, but I decided that a couple days lost wasn't a big deal as long as I got back on track this morning. (The same goes for my diet, actually; I'm back logging away.)
</p>

<p>
Today I wanted to share what I and my colleagues have been up to for the past many months: <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/dreamweavercs4/">Dreamweaver CS4</a>. We released a public beta at 12:01am eastern time, so if you're a Dreamweaver CS3 user (via the standalone product or a Suite), please do download the beta of CS4 and check it out!

<h3 class="title">Taking a Page</h3>

<p>
Thanks to Al's superior parenting skills (and longer attention span when it comes to playing Car Dealership), I got to spend a lot of time reading this holiday weekend, and I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFriday-Night-Lights-Town-Dream%2Fdp%2F0306809907%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1211505780%26sr%3D1-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Friday Night Lights</a> last night. On Saturday night I came across a section that discussed the conservatism of West Texas in general and the 1988 presidential election in particular, and I was struck by its relevance to the current campaign.
</p>

<p>
I don't claim that the issues are exactly the same, or that Obama has much in common with Michael Dukakis in general, but the following section was enough to make me dog-ear the page.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Dukakis forces in Texas had thought they could win the state on the basis of the economy. They thought that the issues of gun control and the Pledge of Allegiance were emotional fads that would quickly die out. They never thought that Bush's rhetoric, a kinder, gentler vision of the "Morton Downey Show," would have much lasting effect. They patiently waited for the campaign to get back to the greater good of forging practical solutions to massive problems, but that shift never took place.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps just once Dukakis should have left the rarefied atmosphere of Boston and Harvard that seemed to entrap him no matter where he was, hopped in a car by himself, and taken a drive down one of those lonely, flat-as-a-pancake roads to the gleaming lights of a Friday night football game. As in ancient Rome, any road he chose would have gotten him there. He could have pulled down his tie and unbuttoned his collar. He could have gone to the concession stand to eat a frito pie and a chili dog and then wash it all down with one of those dill pickles that came carefully wrapped in silver foil. Instead of keeping track of the score, he could have sat in a corner of the stands to listen to the conversations around him as well as take note of what people were wearing, observed how they interacted with their children, listened to the songs the bands were playing, watched those balloons float into the air like doves of peace, and let the perfume of the Pepettes and the Golden Girls flow sweetly into his nostrils. He could have counted how many blacks were there, and how many Hispanics.
</p>

<p>
There was a heartbeat in those stands that dotted the Friday nights of Texas and Oklahoma and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Florida and all of America like a galaxy of stars, a giant, lurking heartbeat.
</p>

<p>
Michael Dukakis never heard that sound, and even if he had he probably would have dismissed it as some silly tribal rite practiced in the American boondocks by people who made no difference. But his opponent didn't make the same mistake. He had been down the lonely road to those games, where the heartbeat had resonated more spectacularly than in the healthiest newborn. He knew it was still as strong as ever. He knew what kind of values these people had.
</p>

<h3 class="title">365 Days of My Life</h3>

<p>
I finally got the roll of film that was in the Vivitar Ultra Wide &amp; Slim back, and thus I was able to finish off my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/sets/72157600238740199/">My Every Day</a> set on Flickr last night. I then stayed up past midnight clicking through each and every photograph in the set, reading the copious notes under some of them, wondering at the choices I made to represent certain days when there were 20 or 30 or 100 photos to choose from, lamenting that other days had only a single grainy cell phone or webcam photo to mark their passing (though sometimes that cell phone photo could not have summed up the day more perfectly).
</p>

<p>
I'd seen most of the set before as a slideshow, but it was really only in going through page by page and seeing the descriptions, the tags, the dates, the titles, and the context that I got a feel for what the last year has been like for me. All the yummy meals, all the crazy travel, the deep depression and feelings of inadequacy when it came to work and parenthood, the wonderful family adventures, watching the Beaner grow up, go to school, become obsessed with Blues Clues. Our first whole weekend away together without the Beaner, the Beaner's first day of school, his first time on ice skates&#8212;it's all there.
</p>

<p>
I know I could look at my entire Flickr stream to get a sense of where I've been, and the bi-weekly <a href="http://www.photojojo.com/timecapsule/">Photojojo TimeCapsule</a> e-mails help, too, but there's something about the editing of my year into a single photo a day that's really compelling. I can see why so many people start 365 projects each January (or 366 projects, as the case may be this year). I plan to take a break before starting up another project like this&#8212;maybe a long break, maybe a short one, I'm not sure&#8212;but I *will* do it again.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Work Out!</h3>

<p>
I'm sure I've probably mentioned this before in passing, but in case I haven't: I'm going to a gym these days. I "won" a six-month membership at the Beaner's school auction ("won" being in quotes  because what I won was the auction for the membership, not the membership itself&#8212;meaning that it still cost me a decent amount) a couple months ago, and upon returning from our Spring Break trip to Disney World, I started the clock on it.
</p>

<p>
I think my first day at the gym was April 14, and I've been going almost every weekday since then. At the same time, I've been keeping track of what I eat every day at <a href="http://www.thedailyplate.com/">The Daily Plate</a>. Although I've only lost about 3 or 4 pounds so far, I'm starting to feel (and see!) results. I'm finding myself *wanting* to get up early and go to the gym every day, and I find I miss it on weekends. (This past weekend, when we were in Lancaster, I actually used the hotel gym both days. Usually I pack some workout gear and then never use it.)
</p>

<p>
Part of the attraction is, of course, the time it affords me to read. I listen to an audiobook on my iPhone&#8212;currently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMansfield-Park-Jane-Austen%2Fdp%2F0786162643%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1211506459%26sr%3D1-5&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Mansfield Park</a>, which is one of the Jane Austen novels I never got around to reading on paper&#8212;on the walk there &amp; back, and then I read a physical book&#8212;currently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFeeding-Monster-Money-Smarts-Nerve%2Fdp%2FB00139YHOW%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1212173005%26sr%3D8-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Feeding the Monster</a>&#8212;while working out on the elliptical trainer. The fact that I'm now up to 40 minutes total (35 program + 5 cooldown) is both a testament to the absorbing qualities of my recent reading material and to my improving fitness levels.
</p>

<p>
Every other day I spend another 10 or 15 minutes doing upper-body weights after I'm done on the elliptical trainer. I'm starting to see biceps, and my massage therapist definitely noticed the difference in my upper back and shoulders. I'm mainly doing the upper body training to complement the workout my lower half gets at hockey for half the year, and also in hopes that it'll make me stronger on the ice. (I'd like to have a more powerful shot.) I imagine it'll also help me lift the Beaner, who's now about 43 lbs. (Actually, now that I think of it, both the aerobic workouts and the weight lifting are already helping; I was able to carry him more than 1/2 the way to the PATCO station at 16th and Locust last Sunday without my arms burning like they used to.)
</p>

<p>
Lately I've found myself waking up at 6:50 or so in anticipation of my alarm going off at 7:05, even when I've gone to bed past 11pm. Last night I realized that there's really nothing stopping me from leaving for the gym earlier than I currently do except for a desire to sleep, so I pushed my alarm back to 6:55... and found myself awake at 6:40. This is EXCITING. Sleep is good, and I'm more than happy to get at least 7 hours of it, if not 8 or 9, when possible. But I'm pretty thrilled not to be feeling tired and mopey during the day despite barely getting 7 hours. The workouts seem to be putting pep in my step.
</p>

<p>
Having so much time to myself in the morning is, of course, a bonus as well. Although my errand options have become much more constricted than when I was roaming all over town on morning walks, I do have daily access to Whole Foods, I still get some mind-wandering time on the walk to the gym &amp; back, and with my back deck garden I get as much Zen-like relaxation as I could wish for before starting work. It's heaven. I'm already starting to worry about what I'll do when the membership is up in October. Can I go back to morning walk + twice a week hockey and be happy? Or will I be a gym addict by then?
