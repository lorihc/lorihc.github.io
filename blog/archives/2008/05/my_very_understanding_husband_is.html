<h3 class="title">My Very Understanding Husband Is At the Flyers Game Right Now</h3>

<p>
Oy, I'm sick. I thought Al was being kind of a baby by staying home from work and sleeping for the past three days (mainly because he seemed fairly functional when awake), but now that he's passed the illness on to me, I suddenly understand the impetus for sleep. I slept until 10am this morning, needed another half hour to get out of bed, had a 45-minute nap this afternoon, and at just shy at 9pm am desperate to get back in bed (just have to blog and fix a bug first).
</p>
<p>
The snot and the sleepiness are the main reason I turned down Al's offer to join him at game 4 of the Pens-Flyers series. He'd gotten hold of two extra tickets late in the day, and I encouraged him to go and enjoy himself; I knew he'd have no trouble finding someone in the office to take the other ticket. The other reason I declined is that Austen actually had a GOOD DAY at school today (and afterwards), and I'd told him that we'd go out for ice cream tonight. I didn't want to renig on that promise and abandon him at the same time.
</p>

<p>
I was more than happy to promote Al's going, however, not least because I only realized *after* getting permission to come out to San Francisco during BlogHer that I'd be gone the very weekend we'd planned to celebrate his birthday with a return trip to Annapolis&#8212;and that I'd be gone for his birthday itself. This realization kind of took all the joy out of the SF trip planning, and I'd been thinking all night and morning how to make it up to him. I would have encouraged him to go to the game anyway because HELLO, playoff hockey!, but it's a start. I'm still trying to figure out how to make it up to him ON his birthday, as well.
