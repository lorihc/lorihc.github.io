<h3 class="title">And THAT'S How You Play Hardball</h3>

<p>
I was listening to MSNBC yesterday, as I often do while working, when this crazy shouting match erupted on Hardball. I ran into the other room to watch, and then ran back to my computer afterwards to Twitter what I'd seen. Of course, Twitter was down right then, so I pinged my friend Kristin and gave a breathless account of the exchange between Chris Matthews and Kevin James over IM.
</p>
<p>
Just now, Kristin sent me <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/05/15/kevin-james-appeaser/">this link to a thinkprogress.org writeup</a> of the incident. (There's also a video clip.) It's painful to watch, but fascinating. Moral of the story: <strong>Know your facts, not just your soundbites.</strong>

<p>Thnaks for the link.  I can't bear listening myself these days, so it's always a good thing (as Martha would say) when someone does it for me.</p>
