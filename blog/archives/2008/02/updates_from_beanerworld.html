<h3 class="title">Updates From Beanerworld</h3>

<p>
Sorry for the loooong silence. Busy busy busy, sick, busy, hockey, busy, snow, blah blah blah. Some Beaner things I've jotted down over the past week or so:
</p>
<p>
<strong>He's Been Paying Attention After All</strong>
</p>

<p>
Me: It's time to go brush our teeth.
</p>

<p>
Beaner: Why do we have to brush our teeth in the morning? We already brushed them last night.
</p>

<p>
Me, absentmindedly, because I'm tired of answering this question: Uh, because we have morning breath.
</p>

<p>
Beaner, cheerily: Because we have socks on our teeth! And because we don't want those socks to turn into cavities!
</p>

<p class="separator">
</p>

<p>
<strong>Adding to His Vocabulary, To the Tune of the Wonder Pets! Theme</strong>
</p>

<p>
One morning this week (Sunday?), the Beaner was taking FOREVER to get dressed, and I was getting sick to death of asking him YET AGAIN to put on his damn pants. Al finally came up to see what was taking so long, and I said, "we've learned two new words this morning: <em>tedious</em> and <em>progress</em>." Al immediately broke into Wonder Pets! mode and sang, "This is tedious!", to which I added, "Let's make some progress! Shirt, socks, and underpants, too -- Put them on or I'll yell at you!" [Spank actually made more sense meter-wise, but I didn't want to make empty threats.]
</p>


<p class="separator"></p>

<p>
<strong>SpongeBob StrangePants</strong> <em>or</em> <strong>He Wasn't As Confused As I Thought He Was</strong>
</p>

<p>
I hand the Beaner a pair of underpants and say, &quot;here, put on your underpants,&quot; and I go back to my desk for a second. He comes over and says, &quot;why is he rescuing Patrick?&quot;
<p>
Me: &quot;Who's rescuing Patrick?&quot; 
</p>

<p>
He holds up the underpants and points to the scene screen-printed across the butt: &quot;SPONGE SLAM!&quot;, in which SpongeBob is body-slamming a supine Patrick in the wrestling ring. 
</p>
<p>
&quot;Oh,&quot; I say. &quot;Wrestling. SpongeBob is wrestling Patrick. I don't know why.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Beaner: &quot;No, he's rescuing him, because Patrick fell down. What's wrestling?&quot;
</p>
