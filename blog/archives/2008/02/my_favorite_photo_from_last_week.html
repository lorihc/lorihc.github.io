<h3 class="title">My Favorite Photo From Last Week</h3>

<p>
My friend and QE partner Don took this photo of me and Winsha responding to e-mail on our iPhones between tech summit sessions. It's about as representative of the week as a photo can get; Winsha and I were glued at the hip most of the time, and we were also glued to our iPhones. Winsha carried a laptop on the first day but didn't really use it, so the iPhones were our connection to e-mail, web, and everybody else (via SMS).

<p>Ha ha, we did SMS each other a couple times when we were sitting in the general sessions. (And yes, we were next to each other at the time. :-)</p>
