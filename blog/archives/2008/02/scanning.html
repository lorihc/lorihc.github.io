<h3 class="title">Scanning...</h3>

<p>
A big box arrived while I was in meetings earlier today, and I won't have time to unpack it until after hockey practice tonight, sadly. If it's what I think it is, my Flickr stream is about to be flooded with wedding photos from 2002 and black &amp; white promo shots from bands that no longer exist (if I can find my notebooks of negatives, that is). 
</p>
<p>
Oy, maybe I should try to catch up with posting shots from the past week while I work so those don't get lost among all the old stuff....
</p>

<p>
I should also add: I received the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2238939277/">gift of a camera from a fellow Flickr user</a>, and I hope to have test shots from that soon, too. (I was shooting with 4 different cameras last week, and I only finished the film in one of them.)
