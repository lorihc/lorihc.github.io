<h3 class="title">Catching Up</h3>

<p>
As I mentioned in the last post, I spent last week at my company's technology summit in San Jose, CA. Aside from brief internet access on Monday morning and Friday evening (the latter's when I pushed the last post, written Wednesday, live), I lived on my iPhone. I'm thrilled that that was even possible, but not having anywhere to download all the photos from my camera and having very little time to get my blog thoughts together means that I'm a bit behind. I have the week to report on, photos to upload, injuries to report, hockey games to write about, etc. Hopefully I'll get my shit together tomorrow.

<p>Crud. Why is it that my lax blog-reading happens when people I like are in my area such that they are back home by the time I realize? Sorry I missed you... but I imagine you were busy beyond busy!</p>
