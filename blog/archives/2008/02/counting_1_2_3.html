<h3 class="title">Counting, 1, 2, 3</h3>

<p>
Overheard from downstairs, while I was making lunch for myself in the kitchen (yes, it's 3:27pm, I know):
</p>


<p>
Beaner: "1 plus 1 is 2.... plus one more is 3... plus one more is 4..."
</p>

<p>
I have no idea what he and Aura are doing down there, but it sounds like all the sausage-counting* we've been doing at breakfast is paying off.
</p>

<p style="font-size:smaller">
*The Beaner likes the veggie sausages I used to buy solely for myself (now he eats more than I do), and he always says, "I want TEN sausages!" I cook two and cut them each into 5 pieces, which, now that I think about it, is how I introduced the concept of multiplication. Sausages = math in our house.

<p>That's great: he likes veggie sausages *and* has learned to count from eating them. Good for you :) I'm always amazed at how much kids can pick up and how it comes into use when you least expect it. </p>

<p>I don't have any of my own, but I've seen it happen a lot. </p>

<p>What a fun way to learn counting!</p>

<p>Sausages are quite popular in our house too. Devin covets the turkey variety. And always wants MORE.</p>

<p>Sausage Math!  That's fantastic.  If you decide to homeschool ever you'll be all over it, a natural!</p>
