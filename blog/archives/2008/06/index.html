<h3 class="title">Aphids!</h3>

<p>
I was out surveying my garden domain on Friday night, feeling really happy with how things were growing, when upon closer inspection of the largest orange pepper plant, I spotted a bunch of tiny green bugs covering the new growth in the center of the plant. ACK, APHIDS!! 
</p>

<p>
Somehow, I thought I was immune to these pests. I'd never noticed them in previous gardens... and thus I had no idea how to combat them. "I need to get my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FYou-Grow-Girl-Groundbreaking-Gardening%2Fdp%2F0743270142%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1212341440%26sr%3D8-1&tag=avocado8&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">You Grow Girl book</a> RIGHT NOW!" I said to Al, even before grabbing my camera to snap this photo:
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2541359877/" title="aphids! =:o by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2142/2541359877_8ce39b35cf.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="aphids! =:o" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I quickly looked up the bug spray recipes I'd noticed on prior readings, and was happy to learn that I had all the ingredients I needed on hand. (I can't remember what I thought I was going to do with that lemon I bought last week, but it's now been put to good use.) I chopped up the lemon peel and set it in a bowl of boiling water to steep, then grabbed the already-peeled garlic from the fridge. There were two packets left, so I threw those into a second bowl of boiling water. I then measured out a heaping tablespoon of cayenne powder and dumped it in with the garlic. I briefly lamented not having an onion until I remembered the bag of chopped onion I'd stashed in the freezer. It might not be as good as fresh, but it was better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
On Saturday morning I went to the gym, then stopped at Whole Foods to look for spray bottles. They only had the kind used for perfume and essential oils, so I bought one and figured I'd rinse out an almost-empty bottle of Method grapefruit surface spray and use that for the other mix.
</p>

<p>
The lemon oil solution was much easier to strain than the garlic-onion-pepper mix, so I started with that. I strained it into an empty bottle of Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Castile Soap to take advantage of the soap's bug-killing qualities, then poured it into the sprayer. After three or four applications some of the aphids were jumping off the plant and running along the soil and the edge of the pot, but too many seemed to be surviving.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2541360019/" title="aphids, after the first attack by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2376/2541360019_82c89d067c.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="aphids, after the first attack" /></a>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2541360205/" title="aphids, after the first attack (II) by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3287/2541360205_93942c768d.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="aphids, after the first attack (II)" /></a>
</p>

<p>
In between assaults with the lemon oil spray, I blended up and started straining the garlic-onion-pepper mix. That process took forever thanks to the powdered cayenne, but I eventually got a double-strained mixture into the bottle. In preparing for the pepper assault, I neglected to put on vinyl gloves or even shoes&#8212;a rather large mistake. My hands and feet were tingling/burning all day after the first round of pepper spraying. By the third pepper assault (after a thunderstorm), I'd learned my lesson.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

</p>

<p>
After spending so much time on the most obvious victims in the garden, I thought I'd just check the other plants to see if they were OK. The tomatoes all appear to be healthy and uninfested, but a closer inspection of the red pepper plants and a small yellow pepper&#8212;both planted a few weeks ago&#8212;revealed more aphids. I hit those with the pepper spray, too.
</p>

<p>
This morning the red pepper and small yellow pepper seemed OK, but the large yellow pepper and large orange pepper showed a few living aphids still clinging to tender leaves. I hit them with the pepper spray again and will continue to do so until either all of the aphids die, or the plants do.

<h3 class="title">Ah, Youth</h3>

<p>
From an e-mail I received yesterday from the Morris Arboretum (where Al, the Beaner &amp; I are members):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://www.alumniconnections.com/olc/pub/UPN/events/UPN2156875.html">Last Chance for Moonlight & Roses registration</a><br />
Deadline - 6/4/08
</p>

<p>
A truly enchanted evening at the Morris Arboretum<br />
Friday, June 13, 2008<br />
6 p.m. - Cocktails in the Rose Garden<br />
8 p.m. - Midnight - Dinner and Dancing<br />
</p>

<p>
The party begins at 6pm with cocktails in the Rose Garden and continues with dinner and dancing under the stars.  Once again, guests will have the option to dine in one of two tents - the "Moonlight Tent" featuring soft music in an intimate setting (behind the Widener Visitors Center) or the "Rose Tent" featuring the music of Jellyroll, the party band back by popular demand for their sixth year at Moonlight & Roses.  
</p>

<p>
Registration Options<br />
Dinner and Cocktails starting at $250 per person<br />
Cocktails Only starting at $125 per person<br />
Young Friends Ticket Prices (for guests 35 and under)<br />
Dinner and Cocktails - $125 per person<br />
Cocktails Only - $65 per person<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I had two thoughts when I read this: (1) wow, the gardening world really *does* skew older, if they consider a 35 year-old a "young friend", and (2) I'm too old to be considered a "young friend." Hmmm.
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Perfect Solution</h3>

<p>
We've been looking for (a) something to go in the "Christmas tree corner" of the living room, near the sliding glass door&#8212;preferably either a lamp or something that would hold a lamp; and (b) a place to store all my cameras, camera accessories, and film.
</p>



<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2565808646/" title="new storage cabinet by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3001/2565808646_b196ddee0c.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="new storage cabinet" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Enter the Pottery Barn Outlet in Lancaster, PA.
</p>

<p>
Al and I had split up to shop/watch the Beaner, and when we synced up again, he mentioned seeing a couple pieces of furniture in the Pottery Barn Outlet: one, a telephone table that might work as a camera/film storage unit, and another that might fill the corner in the living room. 
</p>

<p>
I don't know why, but when he mentioned that the second item had drawers, I immediately knew it was The One without looking at it. We'd originally thought that I'd store my cameras and film in the dining room, since that's close to the front door, but I didn't see any reason we couldn't store them in the living room if this unit could hold everything. He mentioned that it was kind of expensive, but I thought to myself, "I bet it's cheaper than the price on the tag. I'll find out."
</p>

<p>
I spotted the thing immediately upon heading toward the furniture side of the store, and my hunch that it was The One was confirmed. The right color, the right size drawers, everything. I was willing to pay the price on the tag (already down about 40% from the original list price of $EXORBITANT), but I looked around for some sign that it was cheaper, and found one: 50% OFF LOWEST PRICE ON ALL BEDROOM FURNITURE. Since this was listed as a dresser, it counted.
</p>

<p>
The only question now was: Would it fit in the car? On the advice of the employee from whom I borrowed a measuring tape, I took the tag off the dresser before going out to measure the car. "If the tag's not on it, nobody else can buy it. You need the tag." I then measured the trunk of the car from every angle I could think of, but it wasn't clear that the thing would fit. I called on Al's superior measuring and spacial skills, giving him the measuring tape and going back to stand guard over the dresser.
</p>

<p>
While I was standing there, a woman came up to inspect it. I said, "um, I think we're going to buy this. My husband's just checking if it will fit in the car." She looked at me with the surprise and confidence of an SUV driver and said, "oh, it'll fit. It's not that big." Me: "Neither is the car." And we get better gas mileage than you, too, beyotch.
</p>

<p>
While waiting and praying that the thing would fit, I glanced down at the tag and noticed that the item code ended with these magical characters: 4CHO. Logically, I knew what they stood for (4-drawer chocolate dresser), but even more than the 50% off sign, THIS seemed to be the sign that this purchase was MEANT TO BE.
</p>

<p>
When Al returned, shaking his head and saying, "I don't think it will fit," I showed him the tag. "It says 4CHO, honey. It's meant to be. It's FOR US." Suddenly, I swear I could see a lightbulb pop on over Al's head. "I know how to make it fit," he said. "We can fold the seat down." Why this hadn't occurred to us before, I don't know&#8212;probably because we think of the backseat as Unfoldable Beaner Territory&#8212;but our seats do, indeed, fold down in a 60-40 split. All we had to do was move the car seat to the other side, and bingo.
</p>

<p>
I ran to the register, and the rest is history. We now have a perfect solution to my camera/film storage problem, a place for the gardening supplies I use most, a lovely lamp stand, and a piece that matches the rest of our living room. And the location has turned out to be perfect: I can step in and grab the 10D whenever I want to document the garden, and I always bring it back to its spot in the dresser when I'm done downloading photos. There's something about knowing it has a place that keeps it from languishing on my desk.
</p>

<p> 
I always know where the cameras are now. I can keep an eye on my film stock and know when it's getting low. And of course, the gardening supplies being right next to the back deck is absolutely perfect. I was leaving them in that corner anyway; now, they're hidden from view, and the living room looks much neater. I couldn't be happier.

<h3 class="title">Burning the Candle (But Not Melting Down)</h3>

<p>
I'm on Day 2 of 7 where I'm responsible for watching the Beaner from 8:30-11:15am, then working from 11:15 to 7:15 as well as for my usual hour or so after he goes to bed. In order to fit my trip to the gym in and get back and showered before Al has to leave for work, I have to get up at 6:30am. 
</p>

<p>
I know that almost any other mom reading this is probably laughing at me now; getting up at 6:30am and going to bed at 11pm, a few hours of childcare and a full day of work are probably normal for most. For me it's a bit of a stretch. Or, at least, it's a stretch when it's 90+ degrees out and humid. I'm seriously ready to go back to bed right now.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img alt="weather_06102008.gif" src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/weather_06102008.gif" width="443" height="307" />
</p>

<p>
The Beaner and I walked to Reading Terminal Market this morning to buy eggs, and by the time we arrived back home at about 10:50, I was dripping with sweat and ready to flop on the floor. (The Beaner actually *did* flop on the floor.) There was laundry to be done, however, so I tackled that first, and then the Beaner and I went out back to pick some peas and eat them on the spot.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2566057912/" title="pea pods, just before I picked two and ate them by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3274/2566057912_a06550fea2.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="pea pods, just before I picked two and ate them" /></a>
</p>
<p>
I have to say, it's awesome having a couple hours in the morning with the Beaner. He's not sad at all when Aura arrives, making the handoff easy, and it's just so nice to be able to interact with my kid at leisure. He's so articulate, and now that he's coming out of his super-rough Teenager Phase, he's a delight to be around.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2567811120/" title="reading the paper at starbucks by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3121/2567811120_a14b73be84.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="reading the paper at starbucks" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I think the end of the Teenager Phase can be attributed to several factors, namely:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Time (every phase, good or bad, ends eventually)</li>
<li>The schedule change that gives Al more uninterrupted time with him in the morning, and me more uninterrupted time with him in the evening</li>
<li>Diet (we're trying out a semi-Feingold program, essentially skipping the elimination of all salicylates and going straight to Stage Two, and I think we're already seeing progress. Just eliminating artificial colors and preservatives seems to have helped all of us.)</li>
<li>Momentum (the better he behaves, the more patient and calm we are with him, and the better he behaves).</li>
</ul>

<p>
I wish I had the energy to fully appreciate this time. Hopefully going to bed at 10pm (I'm trying to BE FIRM with myself) will help. That, and staying indoors tomorrow. It's just too dang HOT to be running errands on foot.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Randomania</h3>

<p>
Between Beaner duty in the mornings, long working hours, and other family obligations, as well as upcoming vacation plans, June's obviously going to be a light posting month. Thus every post I do squeeze in will likely have some variation on the word "random" in its title. Sorry about the spewing, but I want to record a few observations and happenings before I forget them. As I've mentioned many times before, this blog is the best resource I have for keeping track of my and my family's personal history.
</p>

<p>
First, I just want to say that I usually hate regular "update" e-mails from the companies I support with my purchasing or sponsorship dollars, and even the ones that I don't unsubscribe from or send directly to the trash I rarely read. One exception is the weekly "News from PBS 39" e-mail. I originally supported this station because it had Sesame Street on at a timeslot that was convenient for us to record, and because my closest PBS affiliate, WHYY, seemed not to care whether they got any money from me or not. (They had to be begged to acknowledge a rather large donation made as the result of an unexpected inheritance.) 
</p>

<p>
PBS39, on the other hand, calls me occasionally to see if the station is meeting my needs, invites me to events (mostly in the Lehigh Valley, so I haven't been to any yet), and rarely asks me for money. Their "major gifts specialist" called me one day to ask what shows I liked most and to probe a bit into why I chose to support them when I had a station here in Center City I could support. (Apparently I'm not the only Center City resident sending them money; they've noticed a trend.) A few days after that conversation, I received a hand-written note from my caller, who not only remembered the Beaner's name, but enclosed a little Ernie doll for him. PBS is so getting more money from me this year, even if no one dies and leaves me extra dollars in their will.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the newsletter. I look forward to receiving it every week because otherwise I'd probably miss some awesome Frontlines, American Experiences, and Masterpiece Theaters. I can know at a glance whether I need to stop working at 8pm or 9pm and watch "Growing Up Online" or an American Experience on Alexander Hamilton, or whether to check the TiVo later for the program. (As much as I love television, I rarely find myself looking for something to watch on TiVo unless I know it's there already.) It's so simple and straightforward, and like any good marketing piece, it gives me exactly the information I'm interested in (and that would be a pain to gather myself). Yay again for PBS39.
</p>

<p class="sep"></p>

<p>All of the following Beanerisms were uttered last Wednesday night:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Mommy, come here!&quot; he shouts from the tub. &quot;Watch! I will now MAKE BUBBLES.&quot; He sticks the propeller butt of his bath turtle into a yogurt cup of soapy water, and viola!</li>
<li>While in the bathroom watching the bubble-making, I noticed that the toilet seat was up. &quot;What do we do with the seat?&quot; I asked, poised to lower it. Him: "Oh, I left it up in case Daddy needs to pee later. That way he won't have to lift it." I thought it was funny that he hit on the logical argument men have been making since the advent of the toilet seat on his first try. </li>
<li>I started a sticker system a couple months ago to encourage him to get in his jammies/get dressed quickly. Originally I used garage sale stickers (because they were cheap and simple), but I upgraded to pawprint stickers when I spotted them at the Lakeshore Learning Store. On the same night as the bubble making, the Beaner insisted on wearing socks with his jammies &quot;to keep my feet warm.&quot; About 2 minutes after I helped him turn a sock right side out, he ran out of his room, raised his arms over his head in a victory V and yelled, &quot;Da tah dah! Do I get a pawprint?&quot; Me: &quot;Um, where are your pants?&quot; Him, looking down: &quot;Oh. Oops!&quot; (Every day I'm seeing more and more evidence that his mind works very similarly to mine; I probably would have left the house without pants if I'd added a new variable to my routine because hey, I always put on three things, and I just put on three things&#8212;socks, shirt, and underwear.)</li>
<li>After I'd closed the book on story time: &quot;I don't think I want to be a father. I just want to be a kid all day.&quot;</li>
<li>About 10 minutes later, when he should have been asleep: &quot;Mommy, what are ice cubes for?&quot; 
Me: &quot;To make things cold.&quot; Him: &quot;I think we should throw some ice cubes up in the sky so it'll get cooler.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>
<p>We spent the weekend at Al's parents' house so Al and his dad could play golf together for Father's Day, and while there the Beaner got a chance to drive <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/2584177289/">his blue Jeep</a>. On the way home, the Beaner announced that since he now knew how to drive the Jeep properly, he was fully qualified to drive our family car. I told him that he'd need a learner's permit, some lessons, and proof that he could reach the pedals before we'd let him drive the car. He finally agreed that this was reasonable.</p>
<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
While we were away, Al's timed watering system seems to have worked well for my container garden, but the thunderstorm-driven winds on Saturday must've been stronger in Philadelphia than they were in Northern Virginia. I returned to find the large beefsteak tomato plant leaning hard left, its support ring leaning with it. The larger of the two Patio Orange tomatoes and the Sprite grape were also leaning at about 75 degrees. I zip-tied all three plants to their stakes and went around straightening the rest of the windblown plants. 
</p>

<p>
I have garden photos from Friday to post to Flickr, and I'll take some more tonight. The tomatoes are really growing well, and I'm pretty shocked that the "determinate" grape tomato plants are larger and ganglier than the smaller of the (indeterminate) beefsteak tomato plants.
</p>

<p class="sep">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stage Two Feingold Plan we're following is going really well, and the Beaner is being a total champ about refusing foods that might have artificial colors in them. (He hasn't fully grokked the no artificial flavors or preservatives requirements yet and puts everything under the &quot;that has artificial colors in it&quot; umbrella, but as the end result is the same&#8212;he declines offers of any foods I've told him aren't &quot;safe&quot;&#8212;I'm OK with that.) I love that he asks me if something's safe before he eats it, and that he's been so reasonable about accepting substitutes. I'm amassing a drawer full of treats that are &quot;safe&quot;, and I've started carrying around safe lollipops in my purse in case a well-meaning bank or post-office employee offers him a neon-colored, artificially flavored specimen. He still gets his lollipop, so it doesn't matter to him.</p>
<p>He did mention this morning, &quot;I used to be able to eat artificial colors, but not anymore. How come?&quot; I explained that Daddy and I didn't fully understand that they weren't good for him before now; that it makes sense that they're not, but we hadn't thought about it as thoroughly as we should have, and now we've finally come to our senses. I was prepared to add that not eating all the artificial stuff would help his brain function better, but he seemed satisfied.</p>
