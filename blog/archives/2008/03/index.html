<h3 class="title">Vacation Destination</h3>

<p>
Al asked me for ideas for a family vacation this summer that can be accomplished (a) within a week, and (b) by car. We have friends in Boston and Portland, ME; cousins in NYC and Connecticut; and parents/grandparents in Maryland &amp; DC, and we could just pick one of these constituencies and visit them... but we're kinda looking for something different. I think Al has a destination between DC and Florida in mind, while I would not be opposed to Canada (Toronto and Montreal both have their appeal).
</p>

<p>
Since aside from Canada I don't have any specific ideas, I thought I'd throw the question out to the wider (by about four) audience of this blog. Any ideas for a kid-friendly driving vacation with a starting point of Philadelphia, PA? Bonus points for golfing opportunities and the road less traveled.
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Registration Dilemma</h3>

<p>
After hearing the pundits on CNN postulate that the Democratic race would come down to "a showdown in Pennsylvania" last night, I started thinking seriously about registering as a Democrat so I could vote. For a while there it was looking as if Obama would sweep the rest of the primaries or Hillary would drop out, but after winning Ohio and Texas last night, it looks like we're in for the long slog.
</p>

<p>
I've railed here before about people jumping on bandwagons before the process was over, and how I wished every state got a chance to participate and have its voice heard, but now I'm getting nervous. Things are turning ugly, and I worry that the Democratic candidates could beat each other up so much in the primaries that neither would have a good chance against McCain in the general. (I'm actually more worried about Hillary undermining Obama than the other way around; she does a pretty good job of undermining herself, even when he takes the high road.)
</p>

<p>
I'm finding that my support for Hillary is waning as the battle goes on. I still believe she's incredibly smart and capable, and I'm REALLY uncomfortable with&#8212;nay, apalled by&#8212;the vitriol being spewed at her from the blogosphere and the mainstream media, but her campaign is making me equally uncomfortable. There's an oogeyness to it that brings back memories of the "Slick Willie" moniker, and sometimes I swear I can smell the stale-sweat stench of desperation. It's not pleasant. One gets the sense that Bill and Hillary are answering to themselves and no one else, and it makes me, for one, wonder if that's the insular attitude they'd bring to the White House. I hope not, especially if Hillary's the eventual nominee.
</p>

<p>
I'm still mulling over whether to make the trek to my county voter registration office to re-register as a Democrat. I'm also wondering where I put my original voter registration card, which seemed to be staring me in the face every day until I actually needed it. Hmmm.
</p>

<h3 class="title">On the Counter</h3>

<p>
I have a gazillion little videos of the Beaner doing his thing (whatever that thing happens to be at any given moment), and I'm waaaay behind in uploading them all. (I also have a bunch of hockey videos to upload, but that's a topic for <a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/blogs/hockey/">the other blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here's a Beaner video from February 20, the day he and Aura baked pumpkin chocolate muffins together (enter the name of this site as the password to view):

<h3 class="title">The Planting</h3>

<p>
Gayla asked in <a href="http://www.yougrowgirl.com/thedirt/2008/03/03/in-the-beginning-a-seed/">a recent post on You Grow Girl</a> why we garden. I commented that I do it mostly for the results; I find the process itself fairly frustrating rather than comforting/calming/soothing, as most true gardeners do. Nevertheless, I saved up some toilet paper tubes (and one paper towel tube, which I cut into thirds) in which to plant the pepper seeds that I'd also saved, and some tomato seeds that I'd bought.
</p>

<p>
I figured Sunday would be a good day to do the planting, mainly because (a) I was free, and (b) hopefully it would allow enough time to see the seeds germinate before we leave on vacation. I want to assess whether to leave the plastic domes on or take them off before we go.
</p>

<p>
Gayla had mentioned that the little peat disks I'd used a few years ago to start my seeds were a bad idea, but I was at a loss to make my own seed starter mix, despite the <a href="http://www.yougrowgirl.com/thedirt/2008/02/14/mix-up-your-own-seed-starting-mix/">detailed instructions</a> she gave. (I think it's because the supplies at my local Lowe's were sadly lacking; they leaned heavily toward chemical-laden mixes and Miracle Gro organic  stuff that I've used before and found to be full of sticks and plastic, of all things.) I finally found a seed-starter mix that contained the stuff Gayla recommended (although it had peat instead of coir) and no chemical fertilizers, as far as I could tell.
</p>

<p>
I didn't have quite enough toilet rolls to plant as many seeds as I wanted to, so I broke out our stash of yogurt cups (which I can't bring myself to throw away, but can't recycle here) and poked a few holes in the bottom of each.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">

</p>

<p>
I also didn't have any plastic domes from take-out containers handy; I wasn't able to scrub all the food oils off the couple Al had saved for me. When I went out to the garage to fetch the seed starter, however, I spotted four or five Fuji apples still nestled in the plastic-crate dozen we bought at Costco a couple weeks ago. I removed the apples, cut the crate in half, and viola! I had two plastic domes to cover my seed pots. They're just high enough to allow for sprouting, and the diameter of the individual apple pockets is exactly the same as that of the yogurt cups.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Of course, the two days since planting have been somewhat overcast; I'm hoping the sun breaks out for real soon, so my little guys get plenty of light.

<h3 class="title">A Turn Around the Floor</h3>

<p>
We've noticed that the Beaner has started singing on key, and he's also got a bit of rhythm. Not sure if it's just the fact that he's getting older, or whether the music and movement classes he has at school each week (movement twice a week, music once) are helping, but he'll sometimes catch a tune playing in a store or at the house and spontaneously break it down.
</p>

<p>
Here's a video of him dancing at Starbucks on the Saturday before last (enter the name of this website as the password to view):

<h3 class="title">When He's Twenty</h3>

<p>
After a couple (three? four?) months of going to bed on his own after a story or two, the Beaner in the last few weeks has decided that he DOES NOT WANT TO BE ALONE. (I could swear I'd mentioned this in a post before, but I can't find any evidence of it; maybe I just told all my friends?) The story I thought I'd told happened several weeks ago, when I discovered that the Beaner knew what manipulation meant, even if he didn't know that's what it's called. I was busy trying to convince him that he could sleep on his own and STAY ASLEEP ALL NIGHT, and he was just as eagerly trying to convince me that I should stay and sleep with him.
</p>

<p>
Me: No, I can't do that.
</p>

<p>
Beaner: I know, because you'll break the bed. [This is my oft-repeated excuse; that the single loft bed isn't sturdy enough to hold my giant Mom body.] But you could sleep UNDER the bed.
</p>

<p>
Me: No, I don't think so. It's too uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
Beaner: But if I whine and cry [his actual words!], Daddy will come and sleep under the bed.
</p>

<p>
Me: I'm actually trying to get him to stop doing that.
</p>

<p>
Beaner: Because you don't want me to whine and cry?
</p>

<p>
Me: Exactly.
</p>

<p>
After being a total hardass for a while, Al suggested that maybe I could just sit in the room with him until he fell asleep. (He also agreed to stop going up and sleeping in there.) I did that for a couple nights, but I found it boring. Eventually I offered to hold the Beaner's hand until he fell asleep, and that's now our routine. I don't mind much, as long as he doesn't grab for my hands or fingers when I pull up his covers; like just about everything else, I like to feel like I'm doing this chore willingly, and when he grabs at me, I have a strong urge to run screaming for the hills. Because I *can't* run screaming for the hills, I just get mad instead.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, moving away from my character flaws... all that was just the background to what he said tonight, when I reached for his hand after turning out the light.
</p>

<p>
Beaner: When I'm 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 or 20, I won't need you to hold my hand anymore. I'll be able to go to sleep on my own. But for as long as I'm 3, I'll need you to hold my hand.
</p>

<p>
Me: OK, great. Now go to sleep.
</p>

<p>
Beaner: OK.
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Minox Is Vexing Me</h3>

<p>
Just before I left for the Tech Summit in San Jose last month, <a href="http://imjustsayin.squarespace.com/">Apple Cider Slim</a> sent me a Minox PL (and a Rollei flash!) that he'd picked up at a garage sale a while back and never got around to using. It was an incredibly generous gesture that I still haven't gotten around to thanking him properly for (that would be via actual hard-copy thank-you note). Sadly, neither the Minox nor I seem to be equal to this gesture.
</p>

<p>
I'm having trouble getting the hang of focusing the thing... and with an 89.4% failure rate on the part of the shutter over two rolls of 36 exposure film (one Portra 400NC and one Tri-X 400), I can't get enough feedback on what worked at what didn't. In the case of that first roll, virtually nothing worked (except the one throw-away frame I shot at the beginning of the roll in order to advance the film); every other frame was blank, despite the film having wound properly. I tested the shutter with the back of the camera off, so I could see it opening, but I'd noticed when shooting the Portra that the shutter button was kinda squishy.
</p>

<p>
With the Tri-X roll, I noticed the same squishiness for most of the roll, but occasionally I managed to press the button in such a way that I felt more resistance. This probably accounts for the fact that I got 7 exposures on this second roll. (If you're doing the math, I actually shot 38 frames on each roll, since I'm a stingy film-advancer when loading.) Everything I got was incredibly dark, and 5 out of the 7 shots were out of focus. The remaining two weren't technically out of focus, but they weren't very sharp, either. Drat.
</p>

<p class="pictureP">
<img src="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/images/parenthood/2008/beaner_dark.jpg" width="500" height="348" alt="a very dark beaner" /><br />
I like the perspective, but but I'm not fond of the muddiness. The exposure has been adjusted +0.77, the brightness +150, and the contrast -34 in Lightroom.
</p>

<p>
I think if I'm going to have another go with this camera, I'll need to get the shutter release looked at by a repair shop. For the time being, however, it's been benched.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Sunday Morning Tea With the Beaner</h3>

<p>
On Sunday morning we walked (or rather, I walked, and the Beaner rode his new bike*) to Trader Joe's to buy flour and buttermilk for pancakes, and on the way we talked about having tea with breakfast. I suggested that we each have our own teapots. "But I don't like tea," said the Beaner. 
</p>

<p>
"It's OK," I said, "I'll put some apple juice and water in your pot."
</p>

This bottom shot was taken by the Beaner. I showed him how to use the 10D (very, very carefully).
</p>

<p>
*I got a call from Al after my game on Saturday; apparently they were at REI, where the Beaner had tried out a bike that was just his size. Al told him they wouldn't be getting it, but then the cashier asked if Al wanted to use his dividend and 20% off coupon on the t-shirt he was buying...and 20% off a bicycle seemed like a better deal than 20% off a t-shirt. I said, "eh, fine, whatever." I later explained to the Beaner than when his birthday rolled around in November and he asked us what we'd be getting him, I planned to remind him of the lovely blue bicycle that's now in our storage room.

<h3 class="title">Impropriety</h3>

<p>
Yesterday I went to a meeting in New York, a "face-to-face" meeting/discussion/series of presentations with some folks I either don't know at all or have only interacted with via telephone. It occurred to me, when I noticed that one of the other people at the meeting was staring at me, that maybe it wasn't quite proper to be snacking on nuts while taking notes? Later, I wondered if he was staring not so much because of the nuts, but because I had my feet up on a chair? Maybe it was both?
</p>



<p>
For the record, I have a photo from that meeting of another attendee with his feet up on a chair, in the exact same position I was in, so it didn't seem entirely out of place. The fact that I dashed out of the room with a nod and a wave to the few remaining attendees in the middle of the last, least-formal discussion and then shouted back my thanks when the startled-sounding meeting organizer yelled his after me also made me worry,  however. Wow, was that weird? Impolite? Worse?
</p>

<p>
I've never been particularly adept at social graces, I must admit. If I get it right, it's by accident, not by intention. However, I'm beginning to wonder if working at home hasn't made me worse in this area. Working at home is a wonderful, wonderful thing for me, but it also means that I get to indulge my already self-indulgent nature even more, that I mostly only have to please myself, that I have no guideposts about what's "normal" when it comes to propriety in the workplace. 
</p>

<p>
A former boss once told me that I have no poker face, and that it was essential that I develop one when in the office. I got a *little* better at that over the next few years, but I fear now that I'm so out of practice&#8212;and the line between my personal and professional lives is so thin, being only a flight of stairs&#8212;that I'm back at square -1. Worse, I'm not only unaware of my own boundaries, I'm unaware of others', too. I need to find a way to practice social graces, to practice propriety. And I need to remind myself that just because I'm thinking or feeling it, doesn't mean I should say it.
</p>

<p>
So after an awkward day yesterday, when I had the sense that I committed a few faux pas, that I didn't really fit in with the group and made it worse by staying in my own little bubble, and that maybe I wasn't fit to be communicating with the wider world (in person at least), I probably should have put myself in a time out and reflected a little before broaching the subject of politics with my sister tonight. I should have known that I was so off-kilter that I would put my foot right in it, and boy, did I.
</p>

<p>
By way of background I should explain that, despite my protestations here that I am a staunch Independent and actually kind of a moderate, I am considered by my family to be a flaming liberal. This has been a running joke for years; my brother-in-law and I see eye to eye on practically nothing when it comes to politics and policy, and we've often argued for sport. My sister and I also do not agree on many things, but it's harder to joke about it, I think... and I forgot that when I said something tonight which turned out to be both hurtful and offensive to her on the phone. 
</p>

<p>
I didn't realize it was offensive when I said it, though I suspected by her clipped response that she was angry; Al had to explain to me how awful it was when I related the conversation to him after hanging up. It wasn't enough that I'd said I'd meant no offense while on the phone. After five minutes talking with Al, I called back and apologized for being a complete idiot.
</p>

<p>
I won't even try to defend myself, aside from the context I've given above about feeling off in the social graces department. As usual, I was only looking at things from my point of view, and not anyone else's. I swear, if it weren't for Al I'd be even more of a self-centered, disrespectful bumbler than I already am.
</p>

<p>
I apologize again&#8212;profusely, publicly&#8212;to my sister and her husband, and hope that they can forgive me. To everyone else I've interacted with in the past week or so, I offer a general apology for being such a spaz. Please bear with be while I reacquaint myself with common courtesy.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Post Vacation</h3>

<p>
We just returned from a lovely vacation to Disney World (the Beaner's first time there!), and I hope to write about it soon. My parents, Al, and I kept saying all weekend what a good time we had, and I had a whole bullet list of what we enjoyed most in my head to post, but this morning I was hit with a bit of post-vacation depression (not to mention a huge pile of e-mail, a buglist that doubled in size in my absence, and a new feature to implement). Hopefully I'll be able to get the vacation joy to come back to the fore and let it propel me through the pile of work... and the blog post.
