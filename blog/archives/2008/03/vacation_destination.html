<h3 class="title">Vacation Destination</h3>

<p>
Al asked me for ideas for a family vacation this summer that can be accomplished (a) within a week, and (b) by car. We have friends in Boston and Portland, ME; cousins in NYC and Connecticut; and parents/grandparents in Maryland &amp; DC, and we could just pick one of these constituencies and visit them... but we're kinda looking for something different. I think Al has a destination between DC and Florida in mind, while I would not be opposed to Canada (Toronto and Montreal both have their appeal).
</p>
<p>
Since aside from Canada I don't have any specific ideas, I thought I'd throw the question out to the wider (by about four) audience of this blog. Any ideas for a kid-friendly driving vacation with a starting point of Philadelphia, PA? Bonus points for golfing opportunities and the road less traveled.

<p>The Outer Banks in North Carolina. Great beaches.</p>

<p>Savannah. (I don't know if it is really kid friendly.)</p>

<p>Obviously, Orlando.</p>

<p>Have you looked at Hilton Head Island?  It tends to be thought of as more of an older-folk's place, but there's golfing and beaches.  There's a nature reserve with crocodiles.  Apparently there's an Art Center for kids.  I just recently moved to Savannah so I haven't really made it to Hilton Head much, but I've heard pleasant things about it.</p>

<p>Try the Thousand Islands region - get quaint towns in New York AND Canada and only three hours either direction to Toronto and Montreal. It's a 5-6 hour drive from Philly area with not much between here and there other than Syracuse (and plenty of rest stops!)  Straight up 476 to 81 until you hit Canada.</p>

<p>Lots of family things to do in the region and plenty that can be done with a toddler. We have spent lots of time on the NY side of the Thousand Island (Clayton, Alex Bay area) and a little time in Kingston. Great ferry ride across the St. Lawrence from Cape Vincent to Kingston - our little one loved it and no sitting in lines at customs! It takes just as long, but is leisurely instead of a pain in the rear! As we will have a three year old this year, we expect to do a lot more around the area!</p>

<p>Look into it, it's different and may be what you are looking for - something different! </p>

<p>I vote for Canada. I love both of those cities. Old Montreal was just amazing with the cobblestone streets and the European feel.</p>

<p>I'm also a big fan of Vermont (and New Hampshire too...White Mountains). Burlington, Montpelier, Stow. Lots of beautiful scenery, hiking opportunities, waterfalls and such. And a tour of Ben & Jerry's, of course!</p>

<p>Al said last night that his ideal vacation would be like the one we had in Portland, ME a couple summers ago: hotel near the water and a bustling commercial/tourist area, next door to an excellent independent bakery, and with an indoor pool for the Beaner. There was also a lovely walking/biking path that started about 100 yards from the front door of the hotel, which Val and I made use of in the mornings. It was wonderfully relaxing to just hang out at the hotel and walk around nearby. </p>

<p>So far all your suggestions sound like they'd fit this bill pretty well -- including the one a friend e-mailed to me rather than commenting, for Erie, PA. His description:</p>

<blockquote>
We went up there to get the hell out of town one weekend and found it  
completely charming.  Basically there's not much there.  There's a  
town.  It's cute, if small.  There's an indoor water park we didn't  
get a chance to visit.  There's an art museum that could fit on the  
lower two floors of my house.  And there's a lake you can sit on. The  
Beaner might also enjoy the rebuilt (aka "replica") Brig Niagara -- a  
warship designed for a distant past when people were shorter -- in  
whose past we can find the northern border of the United States and  
the eventual birth of New York as the economic capital it is today  
(although the museum doesn't connect the dots that far).
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, these are all great: Keep 'em coming!</p>

<p>Burlington, VT for sure! And next year you can plan it for mid-April during the 9th annual Champlain Shootout.</p>

<p>Hmmm...this isn't really along the lines of what has been suggested thus far, but what about Ohio? There's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Baseball Hall of Fame, a pretty cool amusement park (I hear)...and isn't Cleveland on the lake? It might have a beach?? Of course, it would depend on when you are planning to travel.</p>

<p>The Baseball Hall of Fame is actually in Cooperstown, NY (I've been a couple of times :-). You're thinking of the Football Hall of Fame, which is in Canton, OH. I remember going to the amusement park in Ohio when I was a little kid; it was populated by Hannah-Barbera characters back then. </p>

<p>I guess I never said, but my schedule calls for a week off in July, so that's when we're planning to go. We've got a Disney vacation planned already for this month!<br />

<p>The really good amusement park in Ohio is Cedar Point, but it is really better for older kids - 17 roller coasters.  The location is really nice, though - on a peninsula jutting out into Lake Erie.  The beach surrounding the amusement park is nice, though.  Not too far from Cedar Point (but not on the peninsula) is a Great Wolf Lodge.  It is a lodgy-looking hotel with an indoor water park that is really cool.  We stayed at the one in the Poconos 2 years ago, I think.  My daughter is still asking to go back.  There are other locations of Great Wolf Lodges, including Williamsburg, VA (a suggestion for a summer vacation - I suspect there are golf courses there).  And at the Lodges, you can get themed rooms, like a bear's den, a cabin, etc.  We had a fun time.</p>
