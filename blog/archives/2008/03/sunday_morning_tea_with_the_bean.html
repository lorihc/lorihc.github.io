<h3 class="title">Sunday Morning Tea With the Beaner</h3>

<p>
On Sunday morning we walked (or rather, I walked, and the Beaner rode his new bike*) to Trader Joe's to buy flour and buttermilk for pancakes, and on the way we talked about having tea with breakfast. I suggested that we each have our own teapots. "But I don't like tea," said the Beaner. 
</p>
<p>
"It's OK," I said, "I'll put some apple juice and water in your pot."
</p>

This bottom shot was taken by the Beaner. I showed him how to use the 10D (very, very carefully).

*I got a call from Al after my game on Saturday; apparently they were at REI, where the Beaner had tried out a bike that was just his size. Al told him they wouldn't be getting it, but then the cashier asked if Al wanted to use his dividend and 20% off coupon on the t-shirt he was buying...and 20% off a bicycle seemed like a better deal than 20% off a t-shirt. I said, "eh, fine, whatever." I later explained to the Beaner than when his birthday rolled around in November and he asked us what we'd be getting him, I planned to remind him of the lovely blue bicycle that's now in our storage room.

<p>What an adorable bicycle! Those sorts of presents are so long-lasting that I tend to give in to their purchase on off-holidays too. </p>

<p>And if he really asks for it, on his birthday you can get him bike accessories. Also, I'm a little jealous of his camera skills. </p>
