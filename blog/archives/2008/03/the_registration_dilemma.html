<h3 class="title">The Registration Dilemma</h3>

<p>
After hearing the pundits on CNN postulate that the Democratic race would come down to "a showdown in Pennsylvania" last night, I started thinking seriously about registering as a Democrat so I could vote. For a while there it was looking as if Obama would sweep the rest of the primaries or Hillary would drop out, but after winning Ohio and Texas last night, it looks like we're in for the long slog.
</p>
<p>
I've railed here before about people jumping on bandwagons before the process was over, and how I wished every state got a chance to participate and have its voice heard, but now I'm getting nervous. Things are turning ugly, and I worry that the Democratic candidates could beat each other up so much in the primaries that neither would have a good chance against McCain in the general. (I'm actually more worried about Hillary undermining Obama than the other way around; she does a pretty good job of undermining herself, even when he takes the high road.)
</p>

<p>
I'm finding that my support for Hillary is waning as the battle goes on. I still believe she's incredibly smart and capable, and I'm REALLY uncomfortable with&#8212;nay, apalled by&#8212;the vitriol being spewed at her from the blogosphere and the mainstream media, but her campaign is making me equally uncomfortable. There's an oogeyness to it that brings back memories of the "Slick Willie" moniker, and sometimes I swear I can smell the stale-sweat stench of desperation. It's not pleasant. One gets the sense that Bill and Hillary are answering to themselves and no one else, and it makes me, for one, wonder if that's the insular attitude they'd bring to the White House. I hope not, especially if Hillary's the eventual nominee.
</p>

<p>
I'm still mulling over whether to make the trek to my county voter registration office to re-register as a Democrat. I'm also wondering where I put my original voter registration card, which seemed to be staring me in the face every day until I actually needed it. Hmmm.

<p>There are things I love about Hillary, but I, too, smell the desperation.</p>

<p>She made some comments in the last 24 hours that seemed to hint that a Clinton-Obama ticket might not be out of the question, which I found encouraging.</p>

<p>I'm just pleased that there's still a contest now, that my vote in PA might actually mean something, if only to get my opinions on the record for the superdelegates.</p>

<p>My husband, a die-hard libertarian, changed his registration to democrat after the last election. It pained him to do it, but he found not being able to vote in the primaries even more painful. In this city being a registered democrat makes far more of a difference in city-wide elections than it does in national, but it still makes a difference. </p>

<p>@ratphooey: EXACTLY.</p>

<p>@girlfiend: This is what I'm starting to think. Thanks for letting me know I'm not alone! I will call the voter registration office and see what their hours are, so I can walk over there tomorrow or Friday.</p>

<p>I thought it was creepy when I registered to vote in VA and there was no place to pick a party, but it was great for the primary. </p>

<p>I just walked in that day and they asked me which primary I wanted to vote in. I said "Democrat", they handed me a blue card and I voted.</p>

<p>I know -- voting in Virginia (or any state with an open primary) is the best. I learned from a Flickr contact who lives in Virginia that if the parties hold their primaries on different days, you can actually vote in both. Wild! </p>

<p>My husband just switched from diehard I to D for the primary. He did it by mail and it was really fast. </p>

<p>I would like a Hillary/Obama ticket. But I haven't seen the negative stuff.</p>

<p>That is correct, I am still not sure. I have 6 weeks to decide, tho.</p>

<p>Man, a month and-a-half of pre-primary election advertising ramped up to insane levels...yes, it's gong to be a slog... </p>

<p>I'm starting to worry about both candidates. I *really* dislike Hillary's latest thing about how she and McCain are more fit to be CIC than Obama is--it seems like a really dumb tactic that does nothing but boost McCain in the general (regardless of who wins on the Dem side).</p>

<p>Conversely, if Obama can't figure out a good strategy against Hillary's relatively mild tactics, how can he possibly do well against the Republican machine in the general?</p>

<p>I do wonder whether Obama's just taking the high road (my hope), or whether he just doesn't know how to counterpunch (my fear). I love the Clintons for their policy smarts and keen interest in government, but they always seem to disappoint me in the end by revealing a sleazy side. Yuck. It's all a bit disillusioning. I was hoping to be able to vote for either candidate in the general and feel proud of doing so...</p>
