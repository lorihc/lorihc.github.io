<h3 class="title">Post Vacation</h3>

<p>
We just returned from a lovely vacation to Disney World (the Beaner's first time there!), and I hope to write about it soon. My parents, Al, and I kept saying all weekend what a good time we had, and I had a whole bullet list of what we enjoyed most in my head to post, but this morning I was hit with a bit of post-vacation depression (not to mention a huge pile of e-mail, a buglist that doubled in size in my absence, and a new feature to implement). Hopefully I'll be able to get the vacation joy to come back to the fore and let it propel me through the pile of work... and the blog post.

<p>Welcome back! I'm glad it was fun, but I know what a drag it is to try to get back into things. I often wish life was just one never-ending vacation.</p>

<p>Sounds like it was a good time. It's always tough returning to the grind, but I'm sure the good memories will work their magic :)</p>

<p>Welcome back!</p>

<p>Just go look at your photos on Flickr to get the joy back! When I saw them last week I was infected by the vacation joy and started thinking about planning my own vacation getaway even though I'm in crunch mode right now. </p>
