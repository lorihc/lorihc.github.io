 Last summer (I can't believe it's been a year!), I said to the Beaner, "it's time for music lessons. Would you like to do piano, guitar, or vocals?" He replied, "I want to play the drums." This I found interesting, as I, too, had wanted to play the drums as a child. Well, actually I wanted to play the flute when we were offered the opportunity to choose band instruments in fourth grade, but back in the olden days,...

 Can somebody tell me why this is my most-viewed Flickr photo of all time? It consistently gets 5-8 views a day, and almost all references to it are from within Flickr, not from outside sites or search engines. Is it coming up in Flickr photo searches? Do the members of the Graffiti group dive that deeply into the pool? I have no idea. Do you?...

 In the tradition of other Guess Where? groups on Flickr (most notably Guess Where SF, to which my friend Kristin is an occasional contributor), I've started a group called Guess Where Philadelphia (Center City/West Philly). I'm sort of bummed about the long name, but Greater Philadelphia is rather large and encompasses places like Manayunk, Chestnut Hill, and NE Philly&#8212;places I'm not nearly as familiar with&#8212;and I wanted to limit the group to my stomping grounds. (I'm selfish that way.)...

 That sound you just heard, if you live in the vicinity of 21st and Cherry Streets in Philadelphia, was an asshole honking at me to get out of the crosswalk so he could floor it across 21st Street.

 It's snowing today in Philadelphia. For some reason I'm not thinking of coziness and cocoa, probably because my mind is firmly in March, not February. I did appreciate the near-silent hush of my boots in the snow as I walked to Trader Joe's to pick up some essentials this morning, however, and I'm appreciating the snowy view outside my window right now. In fact, I've raised the somewhat-transparent sunshade on the window for the first time in months so...

 Did y'all know that Daylight Saving Time is being extended this year? Instead of starting on the first Sunday in April and ending on the last Sunday in October, it'll now start on the second Sunday in March and end on the first Sunday in November. In other words, DST will start on March 11 this year instead of April 1, and it'll end on November 4 instead of October 28....

 Last Friday morning I stopped, as I sometimes do while out on my morning walk, at the Metropolitan Bakery. I noticed a small quiche in the 1/2 price basket, inspected it carefully to try to determine its exact ingredients, and finally decided I'd have to ask. Hmmm, I thought to myself, what if they consider this a tart and not a quiche? Wouldn't want to offend anyone by using such a common term as quiche....

 This morning Al and I had brunch at Cafe Lift for the second Saturday in a row. Al had stopped in for lunch there after a meeting in the warehouse district a couple weeks ago, and he fell in love. It reminded him of the kind of place that's common in South Park, San Francisco&#8212;in other words, an industrial, arty, high-ceilinged-yet-homey space where you can get upscale salads and panini&#8212;but much rarer in Philadelphia....

 As I wrote back in 2003, shortly before moving to Philadelphia, I used to welcome each amazingly beautiful day that occurred between May and November in the Bay Area (and those beautiful days occurred, well, DAILY) with an exclamation of "it's another beautiful day in California!" as I pulled back the curtains in the morning. Believe it or not, I've had reason lately to do that here....

 Austen is getting his molars. We noticed the little white prongs sticking up when he opened his mouth (probably to laugh) about a week ago, and they've been coming in fast ever since. At least one on either side of his mouth is totally above the surface now. We don't know if the molars are the reason Austen's been waking up screaming at 5:45 lately (instead of 6:00, 6:15, or 6:45, as usual); it might also be the extra...

 When I left the house for my usual weekend-morning walk with the Beaner, he was wearing a bib. Sadly, not the Korean bunny bib with the two snaps that he can't get off, but a disposable Pampers bib on which it's frustratingly easy for a toddler to pop the velcro. It wasn't until he started begging for the cream-cheese brownie I'd bought at the Metropolitan Bakery just south of Rittenhouse Square that I noticed that the bib was missing....

Two workers were straightening out the Stop sign on Cherry, which had apparently been run down by a driver eager to get his accident over with. (The guy who hit the owner of this grille on Friday evening around 7:30 was probably the impatient motorist in question.)...
