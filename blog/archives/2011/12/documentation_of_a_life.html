<h3 class="title">Documentation of a Life</h3>

<p>
A friend happened to favorite a Flickr photo of mine from 2007 today, which led me to re-read the caption on the photo, which led me to look at the other photos in my stream from around that time, which led me to the photos of our trip to <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2008/01/pittsburgh.html">Pittsburgh</a> just after Christmas in 2007. Al asked, "what was the name of the pizza place we went to with Craig, do you remember?" I didn't, but I said that I bet I'd blogged about it.
</p>
<p>
Of course I had (I didn't specifically blog about the pizza place, but I mentioned it in passing; it was Vincent's Pizza). I used to blog about all kinds of things that were going on in our lives. Now it feels like we're too busy living our lives and I don't have enough time to blog about it, but I'm not sure that's strictly true. After laughing and reminiscing over all the posts from January 2008, I said to Al, "I really should start blogging again." Surprisingly, he agreed&#8212;mostly because he knows that even though it seems like we'll remember everything we're doing now, we won't without a blog post to jog our memories (because 4 years from now, we'll be busy having other adventures).
</p>

<p>
To get me back on the wagon, here's a little tidbit that Al offered after I read the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2008/01/secret_agent_sunscreen.html">Secret Agent Sunscreen</a> post, in which the Beaner referred to him as Daddy TV, out loud to him while laughing hysterically: "That's not as funny as when he called me The Napster."
</p>

<p>
Me: Oh yeah! I remember that! That was recently, right?
</p>

<p>
Al: Yeah, it was about a month ago. I was wearing my Napster t-shirt, and he said, "that's a good shirt for you because you're The Napster."
</p>

<p>
Me: You do take a lot of naps.

<p>It is so funny I should read this post right now (specifically pertaining to recalling long-gone moments in our lives), because I'm listening to "Ghostbusters" as I surf. I found myself reciting lines as I listened, and began reminiscing about our college days when we would walk around campus/town throwing movie lines out at each other. You were so good with this movie, unlike me; however, you once lent me some cassette tapes (blast from the past!) with movies on them for a long drive back to Athens from Maryland. "Ghostbusters" was one of them, so I'm now a master reciter! I'm seriously busting some heads right now...in a spiritual sense, of course!</p>

<p>:-) I figured you of all people would understand the value of recording (both in the "writing down" and in the "to listen to" sense) funny exchanges. There's nothing quite like recalling something that makes you laugh.</p>

<p>Speaking of understanding and making one laugh, I've told this story here before, right? The one about me going shopping at BJs or somewhere like that with my sister, and suddenly breaking out in dance and singing the Jets-Sharks music from West Side Story? And I said to her, "what's this?" And she says, "Laverne auditioning for West Side Story!" I stop dancing and throw my hands in air and say, "YES! THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT! And you are the only person in the world who would have gotten that! No wait, Josie would have, too." (Sadly that episode is not on You Tube, but the "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7oHvQu-dc4" rel="nofollow">Betty pickup please</a>" one is. ;-)</p>

<p>Ah, yes the "West Side Story" episode! The geek in me has been collecting Laverne & Shirley DVDs, but I haven't gotten up to that season just yet. They are VERY slow to release them! I had forgotten about "Betty please!"</p>
