<h3 class="title">Documentation of a Life</h3>

<p>
A friend happened to favorite a Flickr photo of mine from 2007 today, which led me to re-read the caption on the photo, which led me to look at the other photos in my stream from around that time, which led me to the photos of our trip to <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2008/01/pittsburgh.html">Pittsburgh</a> just after Christmas in 2007. Al asked, "what was the name of the pizza place we went to with Craig, do you remember?" I didn't, but I said that I bet I'd blogged about it.
</p>

<p>
Of course I had (I didn't specifically blog about the pizza place, but I mentioned it in passing; it was Vincent's Pizza). I used to blog about all kinds of things that were going on in our lives. Now it feels like we're too busy living our lives and I don't have enough time to blog about it, but I'm not sure that's strictly true. After laughing and reminiscing over all the posts from January 2008, I said to Al, "I really should start blogging again." Surprisingly, he agreed&#8212;mostly because he knows that even though it seems like we'll remember everything we're doing now, we won't without a blog post to jog our memories (because 4 years from now, we'll be busy having other adventures).
</p>

<p>
To get me back on the wagon, here's a little tidbit that Al offered after I read the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2008/01/secret_agent_sunscreen.html">Secret Agent Sunscreen</a> post, in which the Beaner referred to him as Daddy TV, out loud to him while laughing hysterically: "That's not as funny as when he called me The Napster."
</p>

<p>
Me: Oh yeah! I remember that! That was recently, right?
</p>

<p>
Al: Yeah, it was about a month ago. I was wearing my Napster t-shirt, and he said, "that's a good shirt for you because you're The Napster."
</p>

<p>
Me: You do take a lot of naps.

<p>
Me: "This look OK?"
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "Yeah. You look good. You look beautiful."
</p>

<p>
Me: "OK, thanks buddy. :-)"
</p>

<p>
Beaner: "You look better than I ever saw you before."
