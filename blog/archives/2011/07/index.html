<h3 class="title">I Almost Tweeted This</h3>

<p>
It's been so long since I've written in either of my blogs that I was afraid to even open them for fear they'd been hacked by spammers and were crawling with malware. Tonight I finally got the nerve to take a peek, and found no such thing. Instead, I got caught up in reading old hockey blog posts for a good 30 minutes before coming over here to see what was up.
</p>



<p>
It's probably terribly self-aggrandizing to say so, but I rather enjoyed reading my own writing. I'm not always interesting or profound or even particularly articulate, but for the most part I think I write clearly and capture moments&#8212;an event, a game, a practice, a trip&#8212;well.
</p>

<p>
I tell myself that I'm not writing here anymore because [a] I have Twitter for spewing random thoughts (I'm reminded of one of my old blogs that I can't even remember if I rebuilt or mothballed when I moved to a new ISP years ago, called 255 Characters or Less, where the goal was to capture thoughts brief enough to fit in a pager message); [b] I don't have time to write anything much longer than a Twitter message anyway; and [c] if I were going to write something longer, I'd write about work/Scrum/software development process, and nobody who's ever read this blog before would want to read about that.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avocado8/5914366466/" title="Untitled by avocadoh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6026/5914366466_1284fa2c36_m.jpg" width="159" height="240" alt="The Beaner, being silly" class="inline-right"></a>
There are all kinds of kid milestones and moments I could be writing about, but for some reason I haven't wanted to&#8212;maybe for the same reason I spent so much less time on photography this year. No, that last is probably related to the work/scrum/software process obsession.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of kid milestones, it's sort of ironic that the last post I wrote here was about the Beaner entering Kindergarten, since he "graduated" from it last month. There's lots of school drama now (which, if you live in Philadelphia, you may have read about), what with the school that we specifically moved for last summer saying that they're full for grades K-4 and have no intention of expanding, and a school district report that mentions redrawing the boundaries of the catchment area being leaked. We have a backup plan (a very nice one), but as of right now we still don't know for sure where the Beaner will be going to first grade&#8212;and we won't known until mid-August at the earliest. School starts on September 8.
</p>

<p>
Having said that, and even if we don't get into the neighborhood school, I can't regret moving out here. I LOVE this neighborhood, my commute (at least inbound; sometimes it can be a scramble to get home in the evenings), our neighbors, and especially our house (still!). We have sort of adopted a neighborhood stray cat (or s/he adopted us) who comes as often for the lovin' as for the food. As I'm allergic to cats, a cat that comes to visit and keeps me company while I garden but doesn't want to come inside is exactly what I want in a pet. Her love was hard-won, too, which for some reason is a bonus for me. :-)
</p>

<p>
OK, it's late. I won't bother making any promises about writing again soon or blogging about hockey; instead, I'll just end abruptly and go to bed. 'Night.
</p>
