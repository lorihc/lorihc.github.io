<h3 class="title">Water Main</h3>

<p>
The water main at our house broke today (or, more likely, last night, when I noticed a trickle of water running down the side of the driveway). My husband is busy dealing with plumbers when he should be teaching a class (hopefully the other instructor can manage on his own for a bit), we're stressing out about the cost and the likelihood that we won't be able to use the facilities until tomorrow, and my entire family has gone AWOL. In the age of cell phones and business lines, I can't reach anybody for advice. FART!

<h3 class="title">You Need a Permit For Everything</h3>

<p>
After not being able to reach my family (most importantly, my dad or my brother-in-law, who know about plumbing and piping and digging), I called my husband back with my $.02 on the situation: I don't care about the cost. My priorities are getting the job done right, and getting it done quickly. Ideally, I'd like to be able to have a glass of water when I get home, and to take a shower in the morning. He said that he was leaning that way also, and that Plumber #2 (the one with the more expensive of the two estimates) was still there.
</p>

<p>
My husband just called to say that he'd called Plumber #1 back to ask about permits&#8212;something #2's estimate included, but which #1 had said nothing about&#8212;and was told that yes, "you need a permit for everything," but really they just raise the cost of the job, and then an <em>inspector</em> needs to come out and everything, and really you can get by without one, blah blah blah.
</p>

<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, Plumber #2 it is.
</p>

<p>
Al gave him a small deposit, and he's already gone off to get the permit and will be back and digging by sundown. Hopefully we'll be able to use the bathroom before we go to bed!

<h3 class="title">New Haircut, and Bread in the Water Line</h3>

<p>
On Saturday night we finally got our water turned back on at the house, though Plumber #2 warned us to "watch out for bread in the line." Apparently he'd plugged the various pieces of copper tubing with bits of squished-up white bread to keep dirt from getting in the line. Of course, now there was *bread* in the line, and I'm not sure that that's any better. It certainly wasn't for the kitchen faucet, which clogged immediately; my husband had to get under there with a water jug and flush all the bread out before we could use the sink.
</p>

<p>
While he was busy doing that (and calling me out to turn the faucet on from time to time), I was busy in the bathroom, having a hair crisis. Usually I cut my own hair&#8212;until it's time for a completely new style, in which case I book a flight to Baltimore to see my sister and an appointment at <a href="http://www.hugosalon.com/Hugo-enter.html" target="a8_win">Hugo Salon</a> to see Toni. I'd been talking about getting a new cut for a couple weeks, but I didn't get on the stick quick enough before I had a hair meltdown.
</p>

<p>
Basically, I was standing in the bathroom after taking a (blessed-after-two-days-without-water) shower, and the thought of having to dry the overbleached birdsnest of a mop on my head made me run for the scissors. I shouted to Al that I was going to cut my hair (one last chance to stop me) as I combed my overlong bangs forward, and when he shouted "OK!" back, I started cutting. It took a few tries to get it looking like an intentional cut rather than an accidental butchering, and it still doesn't look as clean as Toni would make it, but it'll do for now. At least I don't have to blow-dry it anymore, or tuck a huge swath of bangs behind my ear. The spikes of the 90s are back, baby!
