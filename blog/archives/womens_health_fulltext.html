<h3 class="title">Think Yuck</h3>

<p>
A few weeks ago, when I was walking down JFK Blvd. toward Love Plaza, I noticed that the water in the fountain there was pink. I chalked it up to a bizarre prank. Then, a few nights later, Al and I noticed as we drove south on Broad Street toward City Hall that a few of the downtown buildings were lit with pink spotlights. "What's with the pink?" Al asked. I shrugged, and mentioned the fountain.

<p>
The following week I was walking around town with my sister-in-law, and I saw that the fountain in Love Plaza&#8212;and several others&#8212;were still filled with pink water. Suddenly, it dawned on me: October is "Breast Cancer Awareness Month", and as we all know, breast cancer is PINK.
</p>

<p>
I'm obviously being sarcastic here. The color I most associate with breast cancer is not pink, but yellow. It's the color my close friend and former roommate of 5 years, Pat Serino, turned when breast cancer spread to her liver, giving her a bad case of jaundice. Before that, she was an alabaster gray, as chemo drained her energy&#8212;and her stomach. I can't remember a single moment when she was pink. I can remember the angry red of a breast swollen with what doctors said was just a "systemic infection" a few months before she was diagnosed with cancer, and the purplish red of radiation burns between bouts of chemo, but she was never pink.
</p>

<p>
I'm glad that people are now more aware of breast cancer, and I don't deny that my awareness was a little lacking before Pat was diagnosed. But is dyeing fountains pink raising awareness? Is shopping for a cure really buying anything more than increased profits and brand awareness for BMW, American Express, Yoplait, and all the other companies with breast cancer campaigns? I can't help but think that associating pink and shopping with breast cancer is just a way to make breast cancer seem warm and fuzzy and feminine. Let me tell you, it's none of the above. Breast cancer, believe it or not, strikes men as well as women. Breast cancer is an ugly, disfiguring disease. Breast cancer KILLS. It killed Pat, it killed my family's dear friend Loretta Mercurio, and it's killed countless others. It's not pink, and no amount of shopping is going to make it go away.
</p>

<h3 class="title">A Visit to Cancerland</h3>

<p>
Breast Cancer Action sent me this article, <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m1111/1818_303/79665310/p1/article.jhtml" target="a8_win">Welcome to Cancerland</a> (also available as a <a href="http://www.bcaction.org/Pages/GetInformed/HarpersArticle.html" target="a8_win">PDF</a>), a while back... possibly years back. I found it in a box of Truckee stuff, recognized <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805063897/" target="a8_win">Barbara Ehrenreich</a>'s name, and sat down to read it.
</p>

<p>
Much of what I read I already knew, but Barbara really puts it together. I found her insights about the infantilization of breast cancer and the positive-only focus on survivorhood particularly interesting, and although I knew that chemotherapy extends the average patient's life by only days or weeks, I didn't really understand the story behind that statistic. It's summed up in this paragraph:
</p>

<blockquote>
Even if foolproof methods for early detection existed, they would, at the present time, serve only as portals to treatments offering dubious protection and considerable collateral damage. Some women diagnosed with breast cancer will live long enough to die of something else, and some of these lucky ones will indeed owe their longevity to a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and/or anti-estrogen drugs such as tamoxifen. Others, though, would have lived untreated or with surgical excision alone, either because their cancers were slow-growing or because their bodies' own defenses were successful. Still others will die of the disease no matter what heroic, cell-destroying therapies are applied. The trouble is, we do not have the means to distinguish between these three groups. So for many of the thousands of women who are diagnosed each year, Plotkin notes, "the sole effect of early detection has been to stretch out the time in which the woman bears the knowledge of her condition." These women do not live longer than they might have without any medical intervention, but more of the time they do live is overshadowed with the threat of death and wasted in debilitating treatments.
</blockquote>
