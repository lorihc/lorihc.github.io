<h3 class="title">What I Remember of METCO</h3>

<p>
Thirty years ago this September, I started Kindergarten in Needham, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. What I didn't notice then (how could I? I was four and half years old, and had known nothing else) was that the town was predominantly white. There were black kids at school, sure; and by first or second grade, I think, I was aware that they took the bus to school. I'm not sure when I learned that they didn't live in Needham.

<p>
I must've known by fifth grade, because after school one day I saw a girl who was a year ahead of me walking across the softball field toward the edge of the school grounds, and was immediately concerned. "She's going to miss her bus!" I said to my friend. The friend replied, "She lives here." Me: "Really?" I think this was my first inkling that a black family lived in Needham, that black kids didn't just arrive on buses.
</p>

<p>
By eighth grade, I knew that a couple of my friends lived in Roxbury, but I still didn't know that Roxbury was predominantly black, and I wouldn't learn until high school that it was considered a place where white people <em>just didn't go</em>. I got it confused with West Roxbury, where my grandmother was in the hospital and where some of my mom's piano students lived.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure when I learned the term "<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0318/p13s01-lepr.html" target="a8_win">METCO</a> kids", but certainly I knew it by ninth grade. I remember the METCO buses lining up on Webster Avenue behind the school to drop students off in the morning and pick them up in the afternoon, and that <a href="http://www.lincnet.org/metco/mccandparents.html" target="a8_win">some days the buses left later</a> so that METCO kids could participate in after-school activities.
</p>

<p>
I must've known by tenth grade that one of the goals of METCO was integration, because I remember thinking when I passed the three or four tables of METCO kids all sitting together in the cafeteria at lunch that it wasn't working very well. I still saw my friend Chris from eighth grade in the halls sometimes, and I was immensely proud of him for his success on the basketball team, but I'd lost track of my friend Robert. I didn't participate in sports myself (not that the jocks seemed particularly well integrated, either), and all of my close friends were white.
</p>

<p>
When I announced that I was moving to North Carolina in 1984, one of the black kids in my class told me he'd never want to live in the south. "Black people are different down there," he said. My cousin, who had moved to Needham from Florida a couple years before, had voiced a similar sentiment, and I had thought he was just being a racist southerner.
</p>

<p>
What I didn't know until maybe 6 or 7 years ago, when I saw a television movie about busing in Boston, was that Boston was more racist than the South in many ways. In the South, people were just more open about their racism. In the North, you could live in a white suburb, and you never had to tell anyone what you really thought (and believe me, when it was suddenly kosher to voice negative opinions about other races, I got an earful&#8212;from a member of my own family, to my great shock). But back to busing: I'd had no idea how acrimonious the issue had been. I know I was young, but how could I have been so oblivious to this?
</p>

<blockquote>
Thirty years ago, Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of Federal District Court found that Boston school officials had deliberately created a dual public school system, one that discriminated against black students. He ordered forced busing to desegregate. Violence erupted as white parents threw rocks at buses carrying black children to their neighborhood schools. Thousands of white students left the system and enrolled in parochial schools. [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/25/education/25BOST.html?th" target="a8_win">full article</a> (free registration required)]
</blockquote>

<p>
I knew that many kids in my town attended parochial schools, but I hadn't realized that it had been caused by busing. As it turns out, it wasn't. What I learned today was that all the fighting was over a <em>forced</em> busing plan in the city of Boston. METCO was completely <em>voluntary</em>, and it was <a href="http://www.lincnet.org/metco/whatismetco.html" target="a8_win">founded</a> in 1966, almost a decade before Judge Garrity's ruling.
</p>

<p>
Once again, I feel as uninformed about the events of my own childhood as I did when I saw that movie on busing. It was only in trying to find the definition of METCO on Google that I've discovered as much as I have, and now I want to find out more. I've put <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300087659/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">The Other Boston Busing Story: What's Won and Lost Across the Boundary Line</a> on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/registry/3O9CGSTNUGWEN/ref%3Dwl%5Fs%5F3/" target="a8_win">Amazon Wish List</a> for that reason.
</p>

<p>
I'm also starting to wonder if it's time for another trip to Needham, this time with an archaeological goal in mind. I've been to Hunter, NY and Rochester, NY with each of my parents to discover their personal histories; maybe it's time to explore my own.
