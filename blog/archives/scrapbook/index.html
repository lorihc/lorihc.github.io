</div>
<div class="blogbody">
 I've had these shoes since the early 90s, and I've been extremely reluctant to part with them even though I only wear them about once a year now. They represent a time for me, a style, my personality in a pair of shoes. I still remember the time a woman asked me in an elevator, &quot;are those NaNa shoes?&quot; Why yes, yes they are....

<div class="blogbody">
 While vacuuming the kitchen this morning, I got the cord to the vacuum wrapped around my Loobylu mug and yanked it to the hard, tile floor. Needless to say, it shattered. :( The mug had been fading for months, thanks to our overzealous dishwasher, but I was still very much attached to this mug. It captured a moment in time, a moment when I was just starting to read other blogs. Loobylu was among the first of my daily...

 The other night, while watching Clean Sweep (our current favorite home-improvement show), Al said to me, "What would be the one item of mine from the Keep pile that you'd like to see leave the house?" I replied that had he asked me the same question in Mountain View, I would have said his giant television&#8212;but since it fits better in our Philadelphia living room, it didn't bother me as much. I'd have to think about it. "What item...

<div class="blogbody">
 I'm unpacking and sorting through my office boxes today. It's so weird to look through old notebooks, e-mails, calendars and other random bits of detritus from seven years (and several cubes) at Macromedia. I have logs of how I spent my time when I was in developer support, lists of bugs I'd filed or intended to file, meeting notes, half-written articles for the developer center, copies of my tech review of the Dreamweaver 4 API documentation (complete with angry...

<div class="blogbody">
 I'm about to do something drastic. Well, drastic for someone who loves to journal, scrapbook, and otherwise preserve memories and mementos from various stages of my life. I am about to throw away my University of Georgia rugby t-shirts. True, I haven't worn those t-shirts in years. They're too big, acquired in a time when I thought wearing long shirts to cover my big butt made me look thinner. And unlike some other XLs and XXLs that have been...

<div class="blogbody">
 Thirty years ago this September, I started Kindergarten in Needham, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. What I didn't notice then (how could I? I was four and half years old, and had known nothing else) was that the town was predominantly white. There were black kids at school, sure; and by first or second grade, I think, I was aware that they took the bus to school. I'm not sure when I learned that they didn't live in Needham....
