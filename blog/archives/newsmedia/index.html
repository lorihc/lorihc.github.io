 So a few weeks ago, when I was in San Francisco (i.e., away from my normal personal laptop with its handy mail filters), I got an e-mail from someone wanting to know if I wanted to help NPR.

 Nothing is more frustrating than being behind in your blog reading and coming across a reference to a New York Times article that sounds REALLY INTERESTING... only to find that when you click on the link, you can only see the first 40 words or so of the piece. This need not be! The New York Times provides a permalink to each article so that it will remain available to blog readers even after the article has gone "into...

 Al and I cannot stand the local news. We do not want to hear the gory details of all the murders, rapes, drive-by shootings, hit-and-run accidents, and drug transactions that afflict Philadelphia. We hate the hyperbole, the non-news, the on-location reporting when being on-location adds absolutely nothing (look, here's a shot of the street where the water main broke! you can't see anything now, but a few hours ago there was water here!)....

 Al and I have noticed that gas prices are dropping in the area, especially in New Jersey (which is a 10-minute drive away). We've actually been kinda dismayed by this news; kinda dismayed, and kinda torn. On the one hand, it's nice that our expenses are dropping, and we recognize that lower oil and gas prices make a huge difference to people with incomes significantly less than our own. On the other hand, both of us think gas prices...

In other words, remain at your desks. Do not leave the building. Everything's fine....

 Israeli warplanes keep up Lebanon barrage Bombs Fall, Missiles Strike, and Death and Life Go On When does "escalating violence" become war? I wouldn't necessarily say that the use of missles, warplanes, and ground troops alone constitutes war, since the U.S. has been known to use all three in numerous non-war contexts over the past 20 years, but the fact that both sides in this conflict are using them makes me think WAR....
