</div>

 I'd always planned to follow my How to Choose a Major post with one on the fact that English is not a career-ready major, but thanks to a busy couple days of bugfixing and an even busier weekend of weeding, cleaning, furniture-moving, and toddler-wrangling, Pioneer Woman and Sheryle have managed to give a preview of my point in the comments on the Major post. Sheryle writes:...

 No one seems to want to listen to my assvice around here lately, so I've decided to share some with the broader Internet&#8212;and, more specifically, with those college-bound individuals who've yet to choose a major. There are probably many ways to go about this, but I wanted to share the way *I* did it because it's [a] simple, [b] logical, and [c] might surprise you. I know I was surprised by the outcome of this exercise when I did...

 My mom didn't believe in homework. If I ever probed beyond this simple declaration to discover the reasons behind her belief, I don't remember it specifically, but I do seem to recall that she felt that reading and undirected play were hugely important....

</div>

 I graduated high school in 1986&#8212;in other words, 20 years ago. I'm still not sure if I'm interested in going to my high school reunion, but it's been fun learning about where my former classmates from Sanderson High School in Raleigh, North Carolina are now via a Yahoo! group set up for that purpose. I wish there were a similar group for Needham High School Class of 1986; while I didn't graduate from NHS, the kids I knew there...
