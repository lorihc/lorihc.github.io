<h3 class="title">More Travels Around the Web</h3>

<p>
My list of regularly-read weblogs is growing. Found <a href="http://journal.cynthiachew.com/" target="a8_win">another woman out there</a> who's on the fence about the war too, for similar reasons. (She's also just plain neat.) She had a link on her site to an <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2003/03/23/do2305.xml&sSheet=/opinion/2003/03/23/ixop.html" target="a8_win">interesting article</a> about a guy who went to Iraq to become a human shield without really understanding what he was doing.

<p>
This, at the same time that I've lost any sympathy I might have had for anti-war protestors in San Francisco. It seems the social terrorists have moved on from <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/03/21/MN106172.DTL" target="a8_win">blocking streets and assaulting commuters to staging vomit-ins</a>. (I do admit I have some sympathy for the knitters, even though crocheting is my blanket-making method of choice.)
</p>

<p>
In other news, my friend Heather discoverd a few years ago, when she started <a href="http://www.jezebel.com/mirror/" target="a8_win">Jezebel's Mirror</a> (and later Friends of Jezebel's Mirror), that she wasn't the only one who had a penchant for taking self-portraits in mirrors. (I think we all think we're the only ones who are doing it; like Heather, I had zillions of prints of me taken in various reflective surfaces over the years&#8212;and this was before I got a digital camera!&#8212;but I didn't realize that everyone else did, too.) FOJM eventually blossomed into the Mirror Project, and it has only increased in popularity since... which brings us to the present dilemma: the current MP servers can't handle the load. Please consider <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/fundingdrive/" target="a8_win">making a donation</a> (no amount too small!) so the narcissism-as-art can continue. And while you're at it, <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/submit/" target="a8_win">submit a photo</a>. C'mon, you know you've got one.

<h3 class="title">Mysteries</h3>

<p>
I love the misuse of the quotation marks on the hand-written sign:
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/sars/index.html" target="a8_win">http://www.cbc.ca/news/sars/index.html</a> (Link courtesy of LaLaLand.)
</p>

<p>
Do you ever read a blog and assume the gender of the writer (because there is no about page, or because the about page is ambiguous, or because the about page is too hard to find, or because you're too lazy to read the about page), only to find out later that you were wrong? I do.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Stop Blogging Me!</h3>

<p>
Just read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/18/fashion/18BLOG.html?pagewanted=1" target="a8_win">the NYT article</a> that <a href="http://www.dooce.com/" target="a8_win">dooce</a> referred to in her <a href="http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/05_19_2003.html" target="a8_win">latest post</a>. I asked Al once if he minded that I blogged about our activities, or described conversations we had, or attributed thoughts to him (mostly on "<a href="http://www.lori-and-al.com/" target="a8_win">our</a>" site rather than this one). He basically responded that he doesn't necessarily *enjoy* it, but he knows it makes me happy to write about whatever's on my mind, and he's happy that I'm happy. That he tolerates it is all I can ask for.
