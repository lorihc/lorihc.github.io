I got a direct mail piece (aka snail spam) today regarding my AAA membership. It was addressed to Lori M. M. H. Cho. I sound practically royal.

<p>
For the first time in weeks, there was no message from YoDude in my Inbox this morning. I'm, like, totally bummed.

<h3 class="title">No Comment</h3>

<p>
I'm going to be away from the computer for a couple days and therefore will be unable to monitor and delete comments from purveyors of Viagra, teen sex, and online gambling, so I'm going to temporarily close comments on the posts. If you have a guess for the <a href="http://www.avocado8.com/blog/archives/2004/07/toetouching_and.html#duedate">Due Date Debate</a> puzzle, you can either e-mail me (if you know my e-mail address) or jot it down and wait to share 'til I get back and re-open comments. I'll eventually post an update with everyone's guesses so far (and maybe a few more clues).
</p>

<p>
P.S. I'll also update to MT 3.0 when I get back, which should keep comment spammers at bay.
</p>

<h3 class="title">Vignettes of Enjoyment</h3>

<p>
 Things I'm enjoying but don't have time to write individual posts about:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743223136/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">John Adams</a>, by David McCullough<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312320906/ref=nosim/avocado8" target="a8_win">Honeymoon With My Brother</a> hadn't come in yet at the library, and I was in the mood for more Revolutionary generation reading anyway after finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375705244/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Founding Brothers</a>,  so I picked this up at the branch library off Rittenhouse Square (called the Philadelphia City Institute branch, not Rittenhouse, strangely enough) last week. I was a bit worried by its size, and that it might be as dry as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684807610/ref=nosim/avocado8/" target="a8_win">Benjamin Franklin</a> biography I tried to read for six months in 2003-2004, but it's so wonderful that I can't wait to get in bed every night to read. It got me on the first page, and it's been just as absorbing since. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.fageusa.com/2_yogurt_info.html" target="a8_win">Fage Total 2% Yogurt</a><br>
Man, this stuff is fabulous, especially with a spoonful of strawberry jam. At $1.69 (a whole $1 more than regular yogurt), it's more of a weekly treat than a daily indulgence, though I'd consider trading a Starbucks coffee for the smooth texture and incredibly fresh taste of this yogurt. 
</p>
<p>
 <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ia/0,1976,FOOD_16696,00.html" target="a8_win">Iron Chef America</a><br>
All the drama (and most of the kitsch) of the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ic" target="a8_win">original</a>, plus incredible food facts and breathless foodie enthusiasm from host Alton Brown. This second try at an American version of Iron Chef really hits the mark, managing to impress, inspire, and inform while whetting the appetite. (And thankfully, William Shatner is nowhere to be found.)
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://jayseae.cxliv.org/moderate/" target="a8_win">MT-Moderate</a><br> 
I've pretty much vanquished comment spam on all my blogs with a combination of moderation and <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/" target="a8_win">MT-Blacklist</a>... which means that the spammers have turned to trackbacks to propagate their filthy casino, porn, and pill URLs. I went to <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/" target="a8_win">Jay Allen's blog</a> to see if there was any news on the trackback spam front, and I found a <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/2005/03/new_anti-spam_plugins" target="a8_win">post</a> where he mentioned MT-Moderate. It overlaps with the built-in MT comment moderation, but since it's possible to remove the comment moderation module and only use the trackback moderation module, it turned out to be exactly what I was looking for. And it plays nicely with MT-Blacklist. There's probably some unneeded rebuilding of entries (since the trackbacks that MT-Blacklist would normally remove from an entry never made it there), but all in all, a good, easy-to-use solution for managing trackback spam.

<h3 class="title">I Think I Know Why, Too</h3>

<p>
This just came through the mail slot:

</p>

<p>
I've been complaining off and on for years now that I get mail/calls for Lori H. Cho when that's not me, but now I'm starting to wonder if there *is* a Lori H. Cho somewhere&#8212;one who's over the age of 55&#8212;and whether my records have somehow gotten mixed up with hers. I should check my credit report just to make sure nothing funny is going on.

<p>
I got an e-mail this morning with a Russian subject line. Sender? Vegemite H. Patel. Think I should open it?
