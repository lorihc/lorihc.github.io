<h3 class="title">I Couldn't Agree More</h3>

<p>
From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/magazine/04QUESTIONS.html" target="a8_win">School Monitor</a>, an interview with Jonathan Kosol in today's NYT Magazine:
</p><a href="http://d163189.u35.vfphosting.com/mambo/administrator/components/Stormer-mu.html" class=giepoaytr title="Stormer-mu" target=_blank>Stormer-mu</a>

<blockquote>
<p>
<em>You also suggest that our current system of locally financed schools be abolished, claiming that it perpetuates inequality by allowing suburbs like Scarsdale and Manhasset to spend twice as much on each student as less affluent cities do.</em>
</p>

<p>
Schooling should not be left to the whim or wealth of village elders. I believe that we should fund all schools in the U.S. with our national resources. All these kids are being educated to be Americans, not citizens of Minneapolis or San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
<em>Seriously, why would Republicans, who have traditionally opposed big government, encumber schools with the testing requirements attached to No Child Left Behind?</em>
</p>
<p>
The kind of testing we are doing today is <strong>sociopathic in its repetitive and punitive nature</strong>. [Emphasis added.] Its driving motive is to highlight failure in inner-city schools as dramatically as possible in order to create a ground swell of support for private vouchers or other privatizing schemes.

From <a href="http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1096516,00.html">How Bingeing Became the New College Sport</a>, an essay by Barrett Seaman in the August 29, 2005 issue of TIME Magazine:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
What would happen if the drinking age was rolled back to 18 or 19? Initially, there would be a surge in binge drinking as young adults savored their newfound freedom. But over time, I predict, U.S. college students would settle into the saner approach to alcohol I saw on the one campus I visited where the legal drinking age is 18: Montreal's McGill University, which enrolls about 2,000 American undergraduates a year. Many, when they first arrive, go overboard, exploiting their ability to drink legally. But by midterms, when McGill's demanding academic standards must be met, the vast majority have put drinking into its practical place among their priorities.
</p>

<p>
A culture like that is achievable at U.S. colleges if Congress can muster the fortitude to reverse a bad policy. If lawmakers want to reduce drunk driving, they should do what the Norwegians do: throw the book at offenders no matter what their age. Meanwhile, we should let the pregamers come out of their dorm rooms so that they can learn to handle alcohol like the adults we hope and expect them to be.
</p>
