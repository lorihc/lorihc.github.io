 Al got me an iPhone for my birthday last year, and though I wasn't as startled or skeptical as when he got me an iPod for Christmas back in 2003, I wasn't really sure I needed one. I was grateful, of course, because I'd never have gone out and gotten one for myself, and as with the iPod, it turned out to be a revelation. (Al's always ahead of me on the gadget curve.)...

 I forgot to mention in my previous installments on the Nokia E71 NAM handset two other things I tried to do with it: namely, connect it to my MacBook and my Dell PC as a mass storage device, and connect to my MacBook via Bluetooth....

 OK, resuming my E71 review where I left off, with the two trees: There are obviously differences between the two images (aside from the obvious orientation difference); the color's a bit different, and the image is less sharp in different spots, but overall I'd say the quality is about equivalent....

 My plan for this evening was to sit down and write a comprehensive review of my two-week trial with the Nokia E71 NAM handset, but upon emerging from the Beaner's bedroom, I discovered a pile of work awaiting me in my Inbox. It's now 10:28pm, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get to everything I wanted to talk about in one go. I'm going to give it 30 minutes, and then I'll post what I've got. If...

<div class="blogbody">
 About a month ago, I was mailing off a letter, and the envelope didn't seal all the way. I searched around for a sticker to seal it with, but I could find none&#8212;so I used the cover from a book of self-adhesive stamps.
