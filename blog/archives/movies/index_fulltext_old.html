<h3 class="title">Better Luck Tomorrow: Still With Me Today</h3>

<p>
Al &amp; I went to see <a href="http://www.betterlucktomorrow.com/html/index.php?id=about&ImgId=05&banid=synopsis" target="a8_win">Better Luck Tomorrow</a> on Saturday, and we spent the rest of the night and most of the next day talking about it. I'd finally gotten it out of my system by this morning, but then Al offered to drive me to work this morning, and he brought it up again. It's like a song you can't get out of your head, this movie.

<p>
So funny, and yet so disturbing. I'm torn about whether I'd want to see it again. Yesterday, I didn't think so. Today, I think maybe I would...

<h3 class="title">Is 1pm Too Early for Cocktails?</h3>

<p>
I've been watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032143/" target="a8_win">The Women</a> while working on my websites and in between rushing down to take photos of the kitchen remodel, and I'm starting to crave cocktails. Everybody drank like fish in movies from the 30s and 40s, and they looked so elegant doing it that it makes me want to dig through our boxes to find the giant martini glasses I got for my 30th birthday. Although now that I think of it, I gave away all our liquor before the move so it wouldn't spill in the boxes....
</p>

<p>
My sister gave me a bottle of Bailey's for Christmas, but I want a *real* cocktail, not dessert. Hmmm. Oh! I know: our contractor gave us a bottle of cranberry mash yesterday (it's apparently a cranberry-vodka liqueur); maybe I can make something out of that... though what I really want is a Sidecar or a Lemon Drop. Given that I have no vodka, brandy, lemon juice, or triple sec, I'm probably safe (for now) from becoming an afternoon drunk.

<h3 class="title">Lord of the Theaters</h3>

<p>
I just had one of the best moviegoing experiences ever, at the Bridge Theater on the Penn campus. I've been to theaters with better concession stands, and no place beats the <a href="http://www.thecastrotheatre.com/" target="a8_win">Castro Theater</a> for a rollicking good time (especially now that they've renovated the seats), but this theater was just plain cool. Mix a Jetsons theme with 70s colors and UltraLounge style, and you get the idea.
</p>

<p>
There were comfy seats *everywhere*, an actual lounge/restaurant/bar, huge and stylish bathrooms (no lines!), and TV monitors showing views of the snack bar, ticket lines, other waiting areas, and the street outside. Best of all, you could actually relax in the comfy seats, take your time getting popcorn, or feel no pressure to pee quickly, because the theaters all had assigned seating. We knew we were going to be in Row G, seats 7 and 8, no matter how long it took the only person who knew how to make smoothies to show up and make a Pineapple Orange Sunset for Al.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the whole experience was made better by seeing the best movie I've seen all year (possibly in many years): The Return of the King. If that masterpiece *doesn't* win Best Picture at the Oscars, something's fishy in Hollywood. I haven't seen Master and Commander yet, but I can't imagine that it could really be any better. And I'm happy to say that if the Academy gives Return of the King Best Picture on the strength of the entire trilogy rather than just this one picture, at least it will be giving the award to the best movie of the three.
