 I had a week off at Thanksgiving (thank you, Tim), and I made the most of it by creating a list of things I wanted to do and checking them off. It is super satisfying to check things off a list, and it's even more satisfying when the list consists only of things that make you happy, like reading books and doing puzzles and going rollerskating. My Thanksgiving week was so successful that I decided to make another list...

 Al and I started our weekend right with &quot;date night&quot;, our third since the Boopster was born. (The first was in February when my parents were here, and we went out to see Sideways; the second was in October, when we went to see a New Jersey Devils game for my birthday.) This time we went to dinner at Washington Square, a Stephen Starr restaurant that's located, as the name implies, on Washington Square, and afterwards to a movie....

 Al, Austen and I went to see the latest Harry Potter movie at the Franklin Institute's IMAX theater last night. Austen was a prince; he watched the first hour, slept for another hour, and then woke up and watched the remaining 45 minutes or so. I was worried that the IMAX presentation would be visually exhausting (that was the case when I saw the third Matrix movie in IMAX), but it really wasn't. Perhaps the domed screen helped with...

It's another hot day in Philadelphia, and I woke up wondering how Austen and I would spend the 10 hours or so until Al got home without overheating or going bonkers. My usual diversion, a nice long walk with Austen in the stroller, didn't seem prudent in the heat, and I didn't want to spend the whole day trying to work while fighting to keep Austen's little hands away from the trackpad buttons. (He's on my lap at the moment,...

 Al and I went to see the last Star Wars movie tonight. I'll spare you my review (I enjoyed parts of the movie very much, others not so much, but as it's been analyzed to death in newspapers, magazines, and the blogosphere by now, I'm sure I'd be adding nothing new) and instead say a few words about what it was like to see it with Austen. Overall he was very well behaved, and, except for the time he...

 Herewith, some random observations that have been on my mind for a while and which I have not managed to blog about before now: Reading Material I don't know what I was thinking when I stopped at the library the other day; I'm still not done with Founding Brothers, I haven't finished the February issue of Martha Stewart Living (although like all good porn, MSL is pretty timeless), and I'm drowning in Wall Street Journals (I find those crazy...

 I just had one of the best moviegoing experiences ever, at the Bridge Theater on the Penn campus. I've been to theaters with better concession stands, and no place beats the Castro Theater for a rollicking good time (especially now that they've renovated the seats), but this theater was just plain cool. Mix a Jetsons theme with 70s colors and UltraLounge style, and you get the idea. There were comfy seats *everywhere*, an actual lounge/restaurant/bar, huge and stylish bathrooms...

<div class="blogbody">
 I've been watching The Women while working on my websites and in between rushing down to take photos of the kitchen remodel, and I'm starting to crave cocktails. Everybody drank like fish in movies from the 30s and 40s, and they looked so elegant doing it that it makes me want to dig through our boxes to find the giant martini glasses I got for my 30th birthday. Although now that I think of it, I gave away all...

 Al &amp; I went to see Better Luck Tomorrow on Saturday, and we spent the rest of the night and most of the next day talking about it. I'd finally gotten it out of my system by this morning, but then Al offered to drive me to work this morning, and he brought it up again. It's like a song you can't get out of your head, this movie. So funny, and yet so disturbing. I'm torn about whether...
