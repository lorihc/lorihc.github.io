<p>
My husband and I have an activity-filled weekend ahead of us, and I can't wait. We're planning another outing to <a href="http://www.baymeadows.com/" target="a8_win">Bay Meadows</a> on Saturday afternoon, followed by our <a href="http://www.logitechice.com/icecentresj/webref/display-schedule.php?team=79&season=2" target="a8_win">weekly hockey game</a> on Saturday night. On Sunday we're going to see a few open houses in San Carlos and San Francisco, and then we'll have dinner with Terence and Kathleen. We're hoping that they can squeeze us in at the <a href="http://www.slanteddoor.com/" target="a8_win">Slanted Door</a>, but the backup plan (I think) is tapas at the <a href="http://www.thirstybear.com/" target="a8_win">Thirsty Bear</a>.

<p>
The best part is, it's supposed to be SUNNY! And on Sunday (I've heard a rumor), we may hit 70 degrees (about 21, for those of you in Celcius-counting countries). Woo hoo! The rainy spring has been great for hiking around, pretending San Carlos is Ireland, but enough already. Bring on the sun!

<h3 class="title">The Wild Plan</h3>

<p>
Well, the Wild beat the Canucks in the 2nd round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, so we've had to revise our plans. I honestly didn't think they'd make it to the third round (though, to be fair, I didn't think they'd make it to the second round, either), so no there was no hockey-watching in our weekend schedule.
</p>

<p>
The new plan is to watch the Wild game on Saturday at noon, then go out house-hunting on the Peninsula (that should give us enough time to see two or three houses), and then go to our own hockey game in San Jose. We'll go to the track on Sunday, then continue up to the city for dinner with Terence and Kathleen. Whew! I'm glad we can squeeze it all in, and I'm not sad about not being able to house-hunt in the city&#8212;normally I'd do some research ahead of time and have a schedule planned out, and I didn't have time to do that this week. I figure we can look in the city again next month.
</p>

<h3 class="title">The Call of the Wild</h3>

<p>
It must have been quite a picture: a grown woman in a bright purple rain jacket (on a brilliantly sunny day), struggling to run uphill against a 20mph headwind while wearing stiff 10-eye Dr. Martens boots on her (blistered) feet and two laptops, a power cord, and an orange on her back.
</p>

<p>
If it weren't for the Ducks-Wild game, I would have waited for my husband to pick me up in the car.
