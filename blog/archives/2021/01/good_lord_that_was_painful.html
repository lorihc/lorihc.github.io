<h3 class="title">Good Lord, That Was Painful</h3>

<p>
My plan today was to work out, finish updating my blog's templates and CSS to make them more mobile-friendly (I started the other day), and then get some work done ahead of our official return to work tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that while I remembered about half of the CSS I used to know, a lot has happened in the past decade that I'd had no reason to pay attention to until now. In any case, after reading a bunch of CSS references and articles and trimming and twiddling my stylesheets and MovableType templates, I think I've got something workable... but I didn't get any work done, and I haven't gotten to the Fitness+ workout I'd planned yet (tho thanks to a morning bike ride and the random dance and HIIT moves I've learned from Kim, Bakari, LaShawn, and Jamie-Ray&#8212;which I now do while waiting for the microwave or the Chemex&#8212;I'll still close all my rings before bedtime).
</p>

<p>
I <em>did</em> watch a whole lot of news shows today while futzing with website code, so I'm fully up on another round of impeachable offenses, the new strain of SARS-CoV-2, slow vaccine rollouts, and the state of the Senate runoff in Georgia. I also continue to be pleasantly surprised by how coherent and powerful Joe Biden's public speeches are. Keep it up, Joe!
</p>

<p>
I don't think I'll be turning comments back on... probably ever, but if you spot a weird style or dead-end blog page link (I can't do much about the external ones, sadly) and you know me in real life, do let me know. Thanks!
