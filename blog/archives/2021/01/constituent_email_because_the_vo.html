<h3 class="title">Constituent Email (Because the Voice Mailbox Was Full)</h3>

<p>
What is the general topic of your message? (choose one): <b>Homeland Security/Disaster Response</b>
</p>
<p>
Senator Feinstein:
</p>

<p>
I would like you to support the expulsion of Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz from the US Senate. 
</p>

<p>
You may recall taking this oath in 1992: "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God." Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz took this oath, too. They not only did not defend the Constitution against all enemies; they also encouraged an armed insurrection against our democracy, and they flouted the Constitution on the Senate floor on Jan. 6, 2021 in objecting to the certification of electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania. These actions merit expulsion.
</p>

<p>
I have voted for you in every election in which you've run where I have been a resident of California (1998, 2002, 2020). Even if I had not, I would expect you to represent my interests, the interests of Californians, our country, and our Constitution. Please do your duty as a US Senator and expel Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz.
</p>
