 After hunting around in the Movable Type support forums for a while today, I finally found someone who was having the same problem I was&#8212;and more importantly, someone who had pointed him toward a solution. Turned out that moving from one server to another does indeed hose Berkeley DB files, so I had to dump and load them *one at a time* to get rolling again. Took a couple hours and caused a few hand cramps, but I'm back...

 I love regular expressions! And I especially love when I get the pattern right on the first try. Woo hoo!...

 I finally caved and installed Movable Type on avocado8. This after moving my hockey blog over to lori-and-al.com because it had MT... &lt;sigh&gt; I'm not sure if I'll move it back now. Anyway, I was using Blogger for this general-blathering blog, but the archive settings were a pain to manage, and it didn't seem to have a bunch of features that I wanted. Plus, I've gotten used to manipulating the templates in MT. Oh, that everything were as easy...
