 Instead of blogging about the connection between work and Richie Cunningham tonight, as I had planned to do, I spent the past couple hours cleaning up even more crap files left on my site by hackers. (I cleaned up a ton more the other night.)...

 OK, resuming my E71 review where I left off, with the two trees: There are obviously differences between the two images (aside from the obvious orientation difference); the color's a bit different, and the image is less sharp in different spots, but overall I'd say the quality is about equivalent....

 My plan for this evening was to sit down and write a comprehensive review of my two-week trial with the Nokia E71 NAM handset, but upon emerging from the Beaner's bedroom, I discovered a pile of work awaiting me in my Inbox. It's now 10:28pm, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get to everything I wanted to talk about in one go. I'm going to give it 30 minutes, and then I'll post what I've got. If...

 I got up early to come to BarCamp Philly this morning, knowing there was a 99% chance I wouldn't present anything. So far, I'm on track with that prediction. There are several topics I *could* speak about&#8212;CSS, JavaScript, development process, learning to play ice hockey, how to color your own hair&#8212;but none I'm *prepared* to speak about, at least formally....

I was shown three cameras: the Nikon Coolpix S7c, I think one from Casio, and the Fujifilm Finepix F30. I had also wanted to look at the Sony DSC-T9, but...

 So I finally bit the bullet and upgraded to MT3.2 despite my concerns about (a) the interface, which I actually find less intuitive and more labor-intensive, and (b) the new comment-management system, which seemed unable to find comments from any unregistered commenters when I tried out MT3.2 beta 3.
