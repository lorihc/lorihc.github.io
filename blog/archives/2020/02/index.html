<h3 class="title">Recent Adventures in Audio</h3>

<p>
I know the sidebar is meant to capture recent books I’ve read, but I keep thinking that I need to make this blog more mobile-friendly and ditch the sidebar entirely&#8212;if I can even remember how to CSS anymore&#8212;so I’m going to post a few links here. 
</p>

<p>
All of these are Audible links because that’s mainly how I consume books these days&#8212;listening while cleaning the house, doing laundry, running errands, baking, biking, and puzzling. I did recently read a paper book (if I can remember what it was by the end of this post, I’ll include it in the list), and it felt decadent to spend time just sitting and reading. I think sometimes I kid myself that binge-watching The Great British Bake Off or Downton Abbey <em>isn’t</em> decadent only because I’m also doing a puzzle or (ostensibly) chopping vegetables at the same time. In the case of the baking show, I'm doing a lot more standing in front of the iPad than I am chopping.
</p>

<p>
In reverse order of listening:
</p>

<p>
<a href=“http://a.co/dKBzEq9”>Uncanny Valley</a> by Anna Wiener<br/>
I particularly enjoyed how she referred to companies and apps descriptively rather than by name (e.g., "the social network everyone hated"). I'm betting I can convince Austen to read this just for the satisfaction of being able to identify all of them.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://a.co/4iBM4Oq">The Ride of a Lifetime</a> by Bob Iger<br/>
Simultaneously a chronicle of a career, a meditation on management, a justification of acquisition, and a love letter to Steve Jobs. I enjoyed all of it, but I wish Iger had read the whole thing himself instead of just the introduction. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://a.co/8J9INDJ">Disappearing Earth</a> by Julia Phillips <br/>
This is probably the most inventive novel I've read since Colson Whitehead's <a href="http://a.co/bLLXPuc">The Underground Railroad</a> (which I started as a paper book and finished as an audiobook and preferred the latter, as the narrator was excellent), though it's completely different. I love that its focus and point of view is on and about women, and it made a remote part of Russia feel completely contemporary and relevant.
</p>

<p>
I won't bother to list all the political and current events books I've listened to in the past few months, though <a href="http://a.co/gu69J2q">She Said</a> was good, and I recommend <a href="http://a.co/65JiUbe">The Fifth Risk</a> by Michael Lewis.
</p>

<p>
As promised, one more link: <a href="https://www.powells.com/book/-9781594631320">Stir</a> by Jessica Fechtor is, I think, the last paper book I read (over Thanksgiving). I thought maybe there was another since then, but if so, I can't bring it to mind.
</p>
