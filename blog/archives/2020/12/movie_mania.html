<h3 class="title">Movie Mania</h3>

<p>
I had a week off at Thanksgiving (thank you, Tim), and I made the most of it by creating a list of things I wanted to do and checking them off. It is super satisfying to check things off a list, and it's even more satisfying when the list consists only of things that make you happy, like reading books and doing puzzles and going rollerskating. My Thanksgiving week was so successful that I decided to make another list for Christmas break, mostly consisting of similar (if not the same exact) items.
</p>
<p>
On my list are things like hiking and biking and puzzling and reading, and uploading at least one bass line for my Else Always Happens bandmates to noodle on (yeah, I never wrote about that here and intend to eventually), but also something implicit: watching movies. I always spend Decembers watching movies. Yesterday, on Christmas Day, I thought to take account of the movies I'd watched so far, and I came up with such an extensive list that it kind of blew my mind. What's perhaps even more amazing is that the list doesn't include the non-movies I watched (e.g., MSNBC, The Mandalorian) or the podcasts or audiobooks I listened to. Where in the heck did I find the time? In any case, as of this writing, the movies I watched in December include:
</p>

The Bishop’s Wife<br />
