<span class="posted">05:28 PM  ~ </span>This is going to be a tricky year for Halloween blogging, given that I'm now mom to an 11 month-old. Hopefully we'll be able to corral Austen, hand out candy, and track the trick or treaters successfully. Stand by!
</p>
<p>
<span class="posted">05:34 PM  ~ </span>Al's plan to come home early was totally foiled by a long-running meeting. No sooner had he walked in the door&#8212;and before we'd had a chance to turn on the outside light or bring in the trash can&#8212;we had our first trick-or-treater. I think it was Freddy; he had a little trouble selecting a candy bar with his fingerblades.
</p>
<p>
<span class="posted">05:42 PM  ~ </span>Tinkerbell and Thomas the Tank Engine just came by and chose a Smores bar and a Kit Kat, respectively. Tinkerbell in particular looked beautiful, just like a fairy should.
</p>
<p>
<span class="posted">06:14 PM  ~ </span>A little girl who almost passed us by came up the steps and selected a Take 5 and a Hershey bar (it's funny to see who takes more than one item, and whether they ask permission first). I was unable to determine what she was at first glance, so I said, "can you describe your costume for me?" She looked puzzled, so I took it down a notch. "What are you?" She gave me a withering look and said, "I'm a fairy princess."
</p>
<p>
<span class="posted">06:18 PM  ~ </span>Our neighbors, who have a 15 month-old, just stopped by to show off Polly's pumpkin costume and admire Austen's shark suit. They were followed immediately by a year-old Superman, who fished around in the bowl for a while before coming up with a Take 5.
</p>
<p>
<span class="posted">06:24 PM  ~ </span>We just got the mob from the party in Coxe Park&#8212;the costumes come so fast and furious that it's hard to keep track. The highlight was an amazing Edward Scissorhands; also in the group were a Harry Potter, an M&amp;M, a couple Spidermen, and a family of Incredibles.
</p>
<p>
<span class="posted">06:27 PM  ~ </span>A Power Ranger just took two items and was contemplating a third choice when I retracted the bowl. Let's not be greedy now.
</p>
<p>
<span class="posted">06:30 PM  ~ </span>A second wave from Coxe Park just hit; the highlight in this group was a pre-teen dressed as a bat. She looked <em>fabulous</em>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="posted">06:34 PM  ~ </span>A pair of dragons approached and had a little trouble with the answer to "what do you say?" The consensus was a whispered "happy Halloween."
</p>
<p>
<span class="posted">06:38 PM  ~ </span>A very clever front-loading washer ambled up the steps and had us load her choice (a Hershey bar)... well, into the front, of course.
</p>
<p>
<span class="posted">06:56 PM  ~ </span>Sadly, I think this is a losing battle. The combination of small, hungry child and giant mobs of trick or treaters is conspiring to keep me from blogging all the different costumes that are coming by. I'm just going to do the highlights from now on.
</p>
<p>
<span class="posted">07:00 PM  ~ </span>The mime who climbed the steps was pretty obviously a mime, but I had to ask her companion what she was. The men's suit jacket and tie would seem to indicate a businessman of some sort, but I wasn't sure what kind. "She's a mime," she said, unnecessarily, "and I'm a businesswoman." I thought, but didn't say, "oh, is that what businesswomen are wearing these days?"
