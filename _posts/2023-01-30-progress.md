I've made a bit more progress on the migration and cleanup, piecing together various backups and using Dreamweaver's awesome tag-based site searches
to remove outdated code, delete meaningless comments, and add missing containers that caused the CSS to be messed up on some of the archives. There are still tons of full-path links that resolve to the existing site because I haven't updated the DNS to point to GitHub yet, but I'll deal with those later. Also tons of missing images, some of which I probably just need to upload, but some of which probably got lost in the great rm -r debacle.

I'll be at this for a few more days (and possibly weeks), but I have hope now. And I'm excited to add notes here as I go without worrying that I'm messing up the existing blog files. I'm essentially starting over while attempting to preserve everything that went before. Fingers crossed.
