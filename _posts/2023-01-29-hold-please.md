I'm in the process of reviving in my site (and blog(s)) using GitHub pages. As a test run I've uploaded the [All Hallows Eve](https://lorihc.github.io/halloween/ "All Hallows Eve") blog pages; I'm still going through the 23 years of posts in avocado8 and making sure that spam comments didn't creep in.

Someday, maybe, I'll write about how I got here... or maybe I'll just leave all the hosting provider incompetence behind me and start fresh.
